Recent research published in the <em>Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation </em>has shown that direct brain control can be used to control the legs after a spinal cord injury. For the first time in this case, scientists are attempting to allow direct brain control of the muscles involved. Scientists in this case used a combination of an electroencephalogram (EEG) system and direct muscle stimulation with electrodes.

The study’s participant has been paralyzed for five years as the result of injury. He is categorized as a paraplegic, and does not have sensation in or the use of his legs. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150923213931.htm">Science Daily</a> said that in preparation for the experiment, “Mental training was initially needed to reactivate the brain's walking ability. Seated and wearing an EEG cap to read his brainwaves, the participant trained to control an avatar in a virtual reality environment. He also required physical training to recondition and strengthen his leg muscles.”

After almost 20 weeks of intensive training, he was able to walk a 12-foot long course with the aid of a body support system. This experiment serves as a proof-of-concept for the neurological community. In time, the researchers hope to use brain implants and implanted electrodes to develop a more seamless version of this technology.

Lead researcher Dr. Zoran Nenadic said, “We hope that... implant[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent="yes" overflow="visible"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type="1_1" background_position="left top" background_color="" border_size="" border_color="" border_style="solid" spacing="yes" background_image="" background_repeat="no-repeat" padding="" margin_top="0px" margin_bottom="0px" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_speed="0.3" animation_direction="left" hide_on_mobile="no" center_content="no" min_height="none"][s] could achieve an even greater level of prosthesis control because brain waves are recorded with higher quality. In addition, such an implant could deliver sensation back to the brain, enabling the user to feel their legs.”

This experiment is a rare treat for us. We so often bring news of risks and dangers that have lifelong impacts; in this case, we get to tell you that there is hope on the horizon for victims of spinal cord trauma.

However, a full solution may be many years down the road. In the meantime, medical bills and lifestyle changes require compensation. Until we get to the point where simple surgery can repair life-altering injuries, experienced personal injury attorneys are necessary to help you get the compensation you deserve. If you or someone you know has suffered a traumatic injury with life-altering consequences, we are here to fight for your rights.

In 2011, Rita Vasquez underwent cervical spine surgery at Our Lady of the Resurrection Medical Center in Chicago. The surgery was intended to relieve the severe pain that she was suffering as a result of a compressed disc. Instead, Vasquez sustained serious injuries including vascular injury, hemorrhage, nerve injury, and continued bodily pain.

Vazquez filed suit this past September against her surgeon, Dr. Michel Malek, alleging negligence. According to the <a href="http://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/510640533-patient-sues-doctor-alleging-medical-malpractice-in-cervical-spine-surgery">Cook County Record</a>, “The suit says Malek failed to protect vasculature and neurological structures at the time of the surgery from damage and excessive bleeding.” Vazquez is seeking compensation for her emotional distress, pain and suffering, and lost time and wages.
<h2>What is cervical spine surgery?</h2>
Cervical, in this case, refers to the part of the spine from the base of the brain to the bottom of the neck. Surgery on this area is complex; there are many important structures to navigate, from blood vessels and nerve endings to the esophagus and trachea.

The most common form of cervical spine surgery is called Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion (ACDF). The procedure is intended to eliminate root nerve pain that can translate into pain and weakness in other parts of the body. During the procedure, surgeons must navigate a complicated maze of vessels and organs. The esophagus, and by extension the trachea, must be moved out of the way to allow unimpeded access to the cervical vertebrae. Several layers of tissue must be cut or removed to allow access to the spine. Finally, tool</body></html>
