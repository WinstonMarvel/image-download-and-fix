<h2><b>Understanding FMCSA Hours of Service Regulations from our Albuquerque Trucking Accident Lawyer</b></h2><p>Driving a commercial vehicle like an 18 wheeler, semi tractor trailer, box truck, or other large big rig is exhausting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It takes a lot more effort than a smaller, passenger vehicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also requires a lot more attention and focus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This creates fatigue much quicker for truck drivers than for motorists operating smaller vehicles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But if truck drivers stop to take a rest, this means less money for the truck driver and for the trucking company.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because the trucking industry is a time-is-money business, meaning that the faster the truck driver can make a delivery, the faster that they get paid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are incentives to continue to drive a truck as long as possible to earn as much money as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this incentive is dangerous and can lead to New Mexico trucking accidents.</p><p>This is why the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)</a> has enacted certain rules to regulate how long a truck driver can operate a commercial vehicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is important because it keeps the rest of us safe from serious injury in a trucking accident caused by a fatigued truck drivers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These rules and regulations are known as hours of services (HOS) regulations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These regulations are in the FMCSA regulations which are a very complicated matrix of rules.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have been seriously injured or if you lost a loved one in a catastrophic 18 wheeler wreck, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking accident lawyer</a> to schedule a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><h3><b>What are the FMCSA Hours of Service Regulations?</b></h3><p>The FMCSA regulations are important because they set minimum standards applicable throughout the United States, no matter what state the truck is from, in, or going to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These regulations apply in addition to the state law, which usually defers to the federal regulations.</p><p>The hours of service regulations are governed by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.395">Part 395</a> of the FMCSA regulations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The regulations split up time as “on shift” and “off shift.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are just what they mean in that a truck driver is either considered to be on shift meaning he or she could operate a commercial vehicle, or off shift meaning that he or she could not operate a commercial vehicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The regulations further govern the entire week of time that a truck driver has.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The idea behind this is that fatigue will continue to build during the time that a truck driver is still operating.</p><p>The most important components of these HOS regulations in a New Mexico trucking accident include the following:</p><ul><li>Maximum Time On Shift: 14 hours</li><li>Minimum Time Off Shift: 10 hours</li><li>Maximum Drive Time on a Shift: 10 hours of the 14 hour shift</li><li>Maximum Drive Time Without a 30 Minute or More Break: 8 hours of the 10 hours of driving</li><li>Maximum Drive Time is 60 Hours in 7 Consecutive Days</li><li>Maximum Drive Time is 70 Hours in 8 Consecutive Days</li></ul><h3><b>Injured in a New Mexico Trucking Accident?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our Albuquerque Trucking Accident Lawyer Will Check the Hours of Service Regulations For You</b></h3><p>Determining whether there has been an hours of service violation is tricky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes it is not obvious that this may have been the cause of the crash.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may also be because many truck drivers and trucking companies will attempt to hide or manipulate the trucking logbook in an effort to make it appear that they are in compliance with the FMCSA regulations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may fool some car accident lawyers or other non-lawyers, but it does not fool the experienced Albuquerque trucking accident lawyers at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>If you or a loved one has been seriously injured or if a loved one has been wrongfully killed, please call the <a

<h2><b>Understanding the Worst 3 Personal Injuries and Getting Compensation from our New Mexico Auto Accident Lawyer</b></h2><p>There is an infinite number of personal injuries that could be caused by a New Mexico auto accident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ultimate personal injury is wrongful death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there are three particularly devastating personal injuries that could result in significant compensation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because of the substantial hardship that these injuries place on families, as well as the extreme pain and suffering that they may cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">New Mexico auto accident lawyer</a> explains what are likely the top 3 worst personal injuries and what compensation you may be entitled to from these injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you or a loved one have been injured in auto accident or trucking accident occurring in New Mexico, please call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help you today!</p><h3><b>Traumatic Brain Injuries, Spinal Cord Injuries, and Amputations: The Worst 3 Personal Injuries from a New Mexico Auto Accident</b></h3><p>The three worst personal injuries after an auto accident or trucking accident in New Mexico are <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/traumatic-brain-injury/symptoms-causes/syc-20378557">traumatic brain injuries</a> (TBIs), spinal cord injuries, and amputations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These three all have in common certain elements which make them the worst types of injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These include the following factors:</p><ul><li>Extremely painful;</li><li>High medical costs;</li><li>Emotional injuries;</li><li>Permanent disability;</li><li>Disrupting customary and daily life, activities, and functions;</li><li>Likely to effect employment;</li><li>Results in changes of interpersonal relationships (i.e., relay on others for assistance);</li><li>Generally require future care and treatment, including surgeries or medication; and</li><li>Not likely to improve.</li></ul><h3><b>Why TBIs are One of the Worst Personal Injuries:</b></h3><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries, or TBIs,</a> are one of the worst personal injuries because they impair cognitive functioning to a degree where a person may be unable to perform his or her customary activities. This could cause issues such as memory loss, migraines, and language impairments, but it could also result in conditions such as mood swings and irrational anger, problem solving difficulties, and vertigo or balance problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>TBIs could also take a very capable person and disrupt that person’s life so significantly that this person may become unable to function independently without 24-hour care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>TBIs can occur in any type of New Mexico auto accident, but are more likely in heavy collisions such as with large commercial vehicles like big rigs, 18 wheelers, semi tractor trailers, and other box trucks.</p><h3><b>Why Spinal Cord Injuries are One of the Worst Personal Injuries:</b></h3><p>TBIs and <a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">spinal cord injuries</a> share an important point—they both effect the central nervous system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because the brain and spinal cord comprise the central nervous system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the information super highway to send and receive signals, as well as interpret these signals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An injury could be so significant that it damages or even severs the spinal cord.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This cuts of the line of communication from part of the body to the brain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This means that parts of a person’s body may be unable to properly function and shut off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is known as paralysis, which generally could affect one limb (monoplegia), two limbs (paraplegia), or four limbs (quadriplegia).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Spinal cord injuries are considered one of the worst types of injuries in a New Mexico auto accident because a person may lose the ability to carry on his or her normal and customary activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is especially true if an individual is permanently bedridden or unable to return to work.</p><h3><b>Why Amputations are One of the Worst Personal Injuries:</b></h3><p>Like spinal cord injuries, <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">amputations</a> shut off the ability for a person to use an extremity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will effect daily and customary activities, as well as affecting employment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amputations also typically result in residual pain, known as “phantom limb syndrome,” which could significantly increase the pain and suffering that an individual is enduring.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amputations are permanent and require a vicim to learn a new skill to cope with the new burdens imposed by the injury.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes occupational therapy is needed to help a victim learn new skills.</p><h3><b>Did You or a Loved One Suffer Any Injury in a New Mexico Auto Accident?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We Can Help</b></h3><p>TBIs, spinal cord injuries, and amputations are just three of possibly thousands of injuries that could be caused in a New Mexico auto accident or Albuquerque trucking accident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are definitely some of the worst injuries which could allow a victim significant compensation for their injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is why an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico auto accident lawyer like Mark Caruso, Esq. at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. </a>is needed to protect the rights of people after a crash. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or if a loved one has been wrongfully killed, please call our compassionate team for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We handle cases throughout New Mexico, including in Lordsburg, Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe, Roswell, or anywhere else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

TITLE: Value of an Amputation Car Accident Case: Albuquerque Auto Accident Lawyer

<h2><b>Determining the Value of an Amputation Auto Accident Case in New Mexico: Albuquerque Auto Accident Lawyer Discusses</b></h2><p>Any auto accident cause can result in serious personal injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the most serious types of injuries that a victim of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico auto accident</a> could sustain is an amputation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the ultimate injury to a limb as a person will have complete and permanent loss of use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an experienced Albuquerque auto accident lawyer, I know that a victim who has sustained an amputation may be entitled to significant compensation in a New Mexico personal injury action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because an amputation is more than just the loss of the use of a limb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The path to getting to an amputation means there were significant and irreversible injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result is also devastating in that a person may be unable to work again in the same capacity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A person’s daily life will also be altered, even simply tasks will be changed forever.</p><p>At the Caruso Law Offices, P.C., we know the horrors that you went through before an amputation and the difficulties you will go through after the amputation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our compassionate staff will work with you to ensure we have all of the information needed to zealously represent you in a personal injury action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">experienced Albuquerque auto accident lawyer</a> will fight hard to ensure you receive the maximum compensation you may be entitled to for your injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learn more in a FREE consultation by calling (505) 883-5000.</p><h3><b>Components of an Amputation Auto Accident Case in New Mexico</b></h3><p>An amputation is a last resort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meaning that no physician is going to order an amputation without performing a full diagnostic to determine whether he or she can save the limb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes this occurs over several days, weeks, or even months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other times this only takes a few hours or even less to determine a limb is not salvageable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the former, the process will undoubtedly lead to significant pain and suffering until the decision is made.</p><p>Thus, there are four main components to consider in an amputation case:</p><p><b>1) How the Injuries Happened</b> – Injuries that result in an amputation have to be significant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They need to tear apart and destroy tissue to a degree that it is not salvageable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This means muscle tissue, tendons, bones, veins, nerves, and other vital structures which cannot be repaired.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A victim of a New Mexico personal injury action is entitled to compensation for his or her pain and suffering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When an amputation needs to be performed, generally the healthcare provider has attempted to save the limb but simply cannot do so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will be excruciating even with the best pain management.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This pain pre-amputation is compensable and a large value of a case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It may be considered to be past pain and suffering.</p><p><b>2) Amputation </b>– The amputation itself is a surgery which causes pre-surgical fright, use of powerful drugs like anesthesia and pain blockers, and post-anesthesia and post-surgery pain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is what is compensable and is still technically past pain and suffering, even though some may claim it is future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because it is pain and suffering you already endured at the time of your settlement, trial, verdict, or other award.</p><p><b>3) Changes in Lifestyle and Daily Living </b>– If you lose a limb, your life style will absolutely change,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No matter what is amputated and how well you adjust, even if just toes or fingers, you will have life changes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can be compensated for this and this compensation may be significant if you have lost something like an entire leg or arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mobility assistance or other assistance equipment or devices is important to also consider and can result in compensation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This award is broken down into past and future pain and suffering, being what you endured after the amputation but before you award, and what you will endure after your award and in the future until the end of your life expectancy.</p><p><b>4) Employment Losses</b> – Individuals who have suffered an amputation may no longer be able to return to work in the same capacity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may result in a decrease in salary and benefits, or other earnings, which means that you may be entitled to future lost earnings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This could be a huge number if damages were significant enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are also lost wages which you lost after the New Mexico auto accident and after your amputation, which are wages you would have earned had you not been out of work.</p><h3><b>Did You Suffer an Amputation?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Call our Law Firm for an Answer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></h3><p>If you have been seriously injured in any type of auto accident in New Mexico resulting in an amputation, please call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque auto accident lawyer</a> to learn how we can help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is particularly true of a catastrophic injury like an amputation which could result in significant and debilitating conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We handle cases throughout New Mexico, including in Lordsburg, Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe, Roswell, or anywhere else.

<h2><b>Understanding Brain Injuries to Children: Our Albuquerque Auto Accident Lawyer Explains What You Need to Know</b></h2><p>Brain injuries to anyone is very serious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But a brain injury to the developing brain of a child is simply devastating and more likely to lead to catastrophic injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/head-injury-in-children-a-to-z">According to Harvard research</a>, auto accidents are one of the most common causes of childhood brain injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brain injuries could range from mild to severe, but even mild brain injuries to a child could have long-lasting and significant complications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This includes damage to a child’s brain which impair cognitive, motor, and other important functions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever a child has been involved in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car crash and has sustained a brain

</span>Call us today to schedule a FREE appointment by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights.</p><h3><b>Types of Head Injures Which Could Result in Brain Injuries to a Child</b></h3><p>There are many possible types of head injuries which could be caused to a child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While many childhood head injuries are simply a bump or bruise, some childhood head injuries could be more serious and result in more permanent damages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These more severe damages are usually brain injuries, which could create significant impairments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the most common types of head injuries which could result in a brain injury to a child from an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque auto accident</a> include the following:</p><ul><li>Skull fractures – whenever a person’s skull is fractured it is a potentially life-threatening condition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only is this because of the shear fact that the head has been pierced by the fracture, and therefore bone fracture pieces could damage the brain, but also because of the immense swelling which is likely to follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This swelling is what can compress the brain and cause damage to the brain, as well as restrict the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain.</li><li>Subdural hematoma – even where the brain is not pierced, a bleed could occur under the skull and between layers of tissue in the brain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is incredibly dangerous because it will increase the intracranial pressure at a rate which could result in serious injury to the brain.</li><li>Coup-Contrecoup injuries – this is when the brain violently slides inside of the brain and impacts to opposite sides of the skull.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This causes bruising on two sides of the brain and can result in catastrophic injury due to the immense swelling.</li><li>Diffuse axonal injuries – given a violent impact in an Albuquerque auto accident to the smaller, developing child, it is very likely that a child could be viciously whipped around in a vehicle and thrown around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only if the child violently thrown, but the brain could be so violently whipped inside of the head that it results in tearing or brain tissue and structures therein.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is what a diffuse axonal injury is and it can be devastating.</li></ul><h3><b>Was Your Child Injured in an Albuquerque Auto Accident?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We Can Help</b></h3><p>If you or your young child have been seriously injured in any type of auto accident in New Mexico, please call our <a

<h2><b>New Mexico Auto Accident That Resulted in the Need for a Cervical Spinal Fusion: What are Your Rights?</b></h2><p>One of the most common injuries in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico auto accident is a back injury</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This includes neck injuries, which are particularly at risk in a motor vehicle accident to serious injury from whiplash.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When a neck injury is so severe, it may require surgical intervention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One common type of neck surgery is a cervical spinal fusion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is named after the area of the spine (the neck being the cervical vertebrae).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a very invasive and irreversible surgery which results in permanent disability, including restricted range of motion, scars, nerve injury, and muscle damage. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Victims of a car crash who underwent a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">cervical fusion surgery</a> should call our Albuquerque auto accident lawyer to learn how we can help recover compensation for your medical bill, pain and suffering, lost wages, and other damages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we zealously and compassionately work with victims of serious New Mexico auto accidents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Call us by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn what we can do for you in a FREE consultation.</p><h3><b>What is a Cervical Fusion Surgery?</b></h3><p>A cervical fusion surgery is an invasive surgery which is used to help treat disc disease, disc damage, fractures, spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spine), spondylolisthesis (forward shifting of a disc), herniated discs, discs impinging on nerves, and other serious neck injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This surgery may be performed anteriorly, through the front of your neck and usually through a natural fold of your skin, or posterior which would be on the back of your neck.</p><p>The surgery will make an incision and shift, move, or possibly cut tissue to expose the spine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The surgeon will visualize the damage joint at the vertebrae and begin by removing damaged bone, tissue, or discs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The surgery may use surgical cement, artificial discs, or bone grafts to reconstruct the disc in that space to avoid impingement on the spinal cord, nerves, or other vital structures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The surgeon will then use some hardware to keep the joint stable, which includes the use of screws, rods, plates, pins, or additional pieces of bone grafts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will immobilize the joint and keep it from moving, and therefore keeping it from causing pain to surrounding structures.</p><h3><b>Why do New Mexico Auto Accidents Result in the Need for Cervical Spinal Fusions?</b></h3><p>A cervical spinal fusion is likely in auto accidents because of the sheer impact and force generated in a car crash.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The spine, particularly the neck, is very vulnerable to any impact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Particularly in an auto accident, a whiplash motion of rocking the head violently forward and then backwards can easily damage or force discs to slip out of place. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>This is a very serious type of injury that could be sustained from a motor vehicle crash.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have been seriously injured in any type of auto accident in New Mexico, please call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque auto accident lawyer</a> to learn how we can help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We handle cases throughout New Mexico, including in Lordsburg, Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe, Roswell, or anywhere else.

<h2><b>Albuquerque Auto Accident Lawyer Explains Passenger Rights in Car Crashes</b></h2><p>Passengers injured in an Albuquerque auto accident have different rights than drivers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if the driver of the passenger’s vehicle did not run a red light or make a wide turn, that driver may still have some comparative fault for not avoiding the crash or contributing to the crash like driving above the speed limit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But a passenger is not operating the motor vehicle and almost always has no fault for the crash.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is important because the culpable fault of a party may reduce what damages that he or she is entitled to as compensation for personal injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus, drivers and passengers need to be treated differently in terms of legal representation.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we have represented many passengers in motor vehicle accidents throughout New Mexico.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have experts which can visit the scene of a crash and help determine liability, as well as other medical, economical, vocational, and life-care planning experts to help prove your damages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have been injured in New Mexico auto accident as a passenger, please call our experienced Albuquerque auto accident lawyers by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help protect your rights today.</p><h3><b>Why is Comparative Fault Important, and When May Passengers Have Some Fault?</b></h3><p>Comparative fault is very important in terms of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident.</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New Mexico is a comparative fault state, which means that the degree of culpable conduct of the person injured is considered and it will lower an award of damages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, if a plaintiff is awarded $100,000 but found to be 40% at fault, the party will receive only $60,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frequently in most personal injury accidents like motor vehicle crashes or slip and falls, the injured person will have some degree of fault.</p><p>However, a passenger very rarely has comparative fault in a motor vehicle accident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because the passenger is not operating the motor vehicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless the passenger is directly blocking or inhibiting the driver, or telling the driver or other motorists things that are not true (such as to go when there are cars coming), the passenger will most likely have no comparative fault at all.</p><p>This is important because a lawyer cannot representative clients who have adverse interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus, a passenger injured in the car of a driver may have a claim against the driver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lawyer cannot represent both parties because of this, and a passenger should not acquiesce to allow a lawyer do so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doing this may infringe on the rights of the passenger.</p><h3><b>Hurts in an Albuquerque Auto Accident as a Passenger?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We Can Help You Today</b></h3><p>If you have been seriously injured in any type of auto accident in New Mexico as a passenger, please call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque auto accident lawyer</a> to learn how we can help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We handle cases throughout New Mexico, including in Lordsburg, Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe, Roswell, or anywhere else.

<h3><strong>Amputations After an Albuquerque Auto Accident: Understanding Future Injuries </strong></h3><p>An amputation is one of the most serious and debilitating injuries that a person involved in a serious Albuquerque auto accident could sustain.  This is true of any limb or part of a limb that is amputated, especially a dominate arm or a leg.  While most <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico motor vehicle accidents</a> will not result in severe enough injuries to result in an amputation, certain types of car accidents will cause significant injuries which could result in trauma to a limb that must be amputated.  This is particularly true of trucking accidents with large big rigs and 18 wheelers.  The hardest part of an amputation case is not just establishing liability, but also demonstrating the future effect on the victim.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque auto accident lawyers</a> know how to handle amputation cases.  We use medical experts and life care planners to determine what your past and future pain and suffering will be, including additional treatment, surgeries, medications, or physical therapy that you may or may not need.  We also use economists and vocational experts to demonstrate what lost wages and future lost earnings you will have.  Call our law firm for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help you today.<strong>C</strong></p><h3><strong>Causes of Amputations</strong></h3><p>Although most motor vehicle accidents do not cause injuries severe enough to result in amputations, there are certain types of car crashes which frequently will result in significant injuries to a limb and are more likely to result in an amputation.  These types of accidents include the following:</p><ul><li>High speed crashes, including on I-10, I-25, and I-40;</li><li>Trucking accidents involving large commercial vehicles such as 18 wheelers, big rigs, tankers, box trucks, semi tractor trailers, and other large trucks;</li><li>T-bone motor vehicle accidents;</li><li>Roll-over accidents;</li><li>Crashes resulting in secondary injuries such as those from fires or chemical burns from hazardous cargo; and</li><li>Other causes.</li></ul><h3><strong>Future injuries from Amputations</strong></h3><p>While an amputation case is significant because of the past pain and suffering, which is the auto accident causing injuries and the amputation, there are usually future injuries that are not always considered.  These future injuries in an amputation case include the following:</p><ul><li>Need for physical therapy or occupational therapy, especially as one ages and becomes weaker (i.e., can not longer support oneself with one leg after 70 years of age due to muscle weakness);</li><li>Need for new or additional prosthetics, particularly as one ages;</li><li>Phantom pain syndrome and treatment;</li><li>Treatment for emotional harm;</li><li>Future infections which may be likely, particularly at the amputation site which rests against a prosthetic; and</li><li>Other future injuries.</li><li> </li></ul><h2><strong>Victims of an Albuquerque Auto Accident Causing an Amputation Should Call Our Firm</strong></h2><p>If you or a loved one have suffered an amputation after a New Mexico car crash, please call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">experienced Albuquerque auto accident lawyers at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> to help them.  You may call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000, or you can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.  We can help you get the compensation you deserve for your future injuries from an auto accident causing an amputation.</p>

<h2><strong>Albuquerque Auto Accident Causing Back Injuries</strong></h2><p>One of the most common injuries in any <a href="/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Motor Vehicle Accident</a> is a back injury.  This is because your back and spine are rather vulnerable in an Albuquerque auto accident.  Any type of collision will put undue strength on your back, even with the most advanced safety equipment.  This is particularly true of 18 wheeler wrecks with large commercial vehicles such as box trucks and semi tractor trailers.  When the occupant of a motor vehicle has sustained a back injury due to the negligence of another driver, he or she may have rights to compensation for pain and suffering, lost wages, medical bills, lost future earnings, loss of services/consortium with family, and other damages.</p><p>If you or a loved on have a back injury from an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Albuquerque auto accident, please call our experienced lawyers at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation.  We work with medical experts and accident investigators to determine your damages and prove liability.  Call us today for a FREE consultation to learn what we can do for you by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><h3>Types of Back Injuries in an Albuquerque Auto Accident </h3><p>There are many different types of back injuries which could be caused by an Albuquerque auto accident.  The severity of these injuries range demanding on several factors, including the speed of the impact, direction of the impact, age of the occupant, any preexisting conditions, and many other factors.  Some of the most common types of back injuries from a motor vehicle accident in New Mexico include the following:</p><ul><li>Herniated discs;</li><li>Paralysis;</li><li>Nerve pain such as sciatic nerve pain down your leg; </li><li>Intense headaches from cervical back injuries;</li><li>Inability to sit or stand for even short periods of time;</li><li>Inability to hold anything, or to push or pull;</li><li>Slipped discs;</li><li>Compression fractures of the vertebrae;</li><li>Intense pain in the back;</li><li>Permanent pins and needles;</li><li>Loss of sensation in the extremities, usually the hands or feet;</li><li>Debilitating nerve injuries; and</li><li>Many other conditions</li></ul><h3>Back Injuries Need to be Treated Carefully</h3><p>A back injury can be a tough injury to prove in court.  This is because many defense lawyers will try to prove that your back injury is really a “pre-existing” injury, or that your back injury is due to the natural aging process known as degenerative disc disease.  While it is due that degenerative disc disease is present in almost every single person, even in 20-year-olds, this disease is incredibly common and almost always asymptomatic (meaning there is not pain or limitations from it).  Thus, when there is a serious auto accident the degenerative disc disease could become irritated or exacerbated which may be part of the injuries in an Albuquerque auto accident.</p><p>Therefore, if this happens to you please call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">experienced Albuquerque auto accident lawyers at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> to help them.  You may call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000, or you can also <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact us</a> on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

for the first time at the end of their first semester.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Less experience means less ability to safely operate a motor vehicle in certain

TITLE: Shoulder Injuries and Shoulder Surgery After Albuquerque Auto Accident

<h2><b>Rights of a Victim of an Albuquerque Auto Accident Who Suffered Shoulder Injuries or Required Shoulder Surgery</b></h2><p>Even though your shoulder is not weight bearing, it is considered by most medical providers to be the most complex joint and most important joint.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because your shoulder is wrapped in many small ligaments, tendons, and muscles, as well as funneling a large amount of nerves and blood vessels through the same, small space in your shoulder girdle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus, when an Albuquerque auto accident causes serious shoulder injuries or requires a victim to receive shoulder surgery, there could be a long path to recover due to the disability.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know that shoulder injuries can be very painful and debilitating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is magnified when a patient undergoes shoulder surgery, which could takes months of healing and physical therapy before a patient is able to return to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It could take years for a patient’s strength to return, and it may not completely return.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is why our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">experienced Albuquerque auto accident lawyer</a> can work with you and your family to ensure you receive the compensation you deserve for your pain and suffering, medical bills, medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, future surgeries, and lost earnings from having to take a different job due to the inability to return to the same job because of your shoulder injury.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Call us to schedule a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can start protecting your rights today.</p><h2><b>Types of Shoulder Injuries From an Albuquerque Auto Accident</b></h2><p>Shoulder injuries frequently result in shoulder surgery, which is a very serious procedure because a patient is likely to be in extreme pain for several days following such procedure as the shoulder heals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shoulder surgeries could be caused by a wide array of motor vehicle accidents, including collisions head on, rear end, T-bone, side-swipe, or any other combination or angle of contact.</p><p>Some of the most common types of shoulder injuries due to Albuquerque auto accidents which may allow a victim to recover compensation include the following:</p><ul><li>Torn rotator cuff – you have four rotator cuffs which help move, twist, and otherwise rotate your shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While no one rotator cuff is particularly strong, together they are very strong and able to move your shoulder and support weight through employing and relying on your debt muscles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have even one rotator cuff torn, not only will you have extreme pain but also the inability to lift even insignificant weight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rotator cuff tears almost always need surgical intervention, particularly if they are completely torn.</li><li>SLAP tears – a “Superior Labral tear from the Anterior to Posterior,” or a “SLAP” tear, is when there is damage to the “socket” part of your ball-and-socket shoulder joint at the uppermost area fo the joint.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This requires surgery to repair and can result in years of pain and debilitation.</li><li>Brachial plexus injuries – this is nerve damage to the large bundle of nerves which extend through your shoulder girdle and down your arm, all the way to your fingertips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The brachial plexus originates from nerves branching off your cervical (neck) vertebrae and bundling together at the base of your neck before extending through your shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Injuries here can result in permanent loss of sensation or function of any part of the arm, forearm, hands, or fingers, including a total loss of sensation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surgery can be used to help repair damage or connect a recently ruptured nerve, but it is a risky procedure, extremely painful, and not always likely to be successful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li></ul><h2><b>Shoulder Injuries Caused by an Albuquerque Auto Accident and Resulting in a Shoulder Surgery</b></h2><p>If you or a loved one underwent a shoulder surgery due to your shoulder injuries after an Albuquerque auto accident, you have rights to protect under New Mexico Law.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque auto accident lawyer</a> to learn how we can help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We handle cases throughout

<h2><b>Understanding HIPAA and a New Mexico Auto Accident: What Medical Records You Need to Disclose</b></h2><p>We all know that our medical records are protected under HIPAA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is why we sign waivers when we sign in with doctor’s offices that allow that office to send your medical records to other providers, like your primary care physician or a laboratory for testing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While HIPAA is very strong and important, many people wonder are surprised to learn that in a New Mexico auto accident case they need to disclose their health records to the other party.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some people may be embarrassed what is in their medical records, and others do not want the invasion of privacy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many clients and victims of personal injury accidents ask why they must disclose their personal information.</p><p>Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">experienced New Mexico auto accident lawyer</a> knows that these types of disclosures are sensitive for some people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many people may worry that their protected health information is being used improperly, particularly by the other side which may be angry that we have a claim against them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our compassionate team will help explain to you your rights and ensure that the medical records that are disclosed are proper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. to learn how we can help you by failing (505) 883-5000.</p><h3><b>Why Do I Need to Disclose my Medical Records in a New Mexico Auto Accident?</b></h3><p>If you have been involved in an auto accident in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe, or anywhere else in New Mexico, you will need to disclose your health records.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While HIPAA protects the disclosure of your medical records and sensitive medical information, by bringing a personal injury action you are putting your health at issue and the law deems you to be effectively waiving your HIPAA rights.</p><p>In addition, our system of jurisprudence requires the plaintiff to prove his or her case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To prove your personal injuries, you will need to establish that you have been injured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will require you to provide medical evidence, in the form of medical records and likely medical testimony from your treating physicians and/or experts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is also part of the waiver of HIPAA.</p><h3><b>What Medical Records are NOT Waived in a Personal Injury Action?</b></h3><p>While you are required to prove your personal injuries and waive HIPAA rights, that waiver is only for injuries related to or that have any bearing on your claims.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This means that certain medical records may or may not be deemed waived by commencing a New Mexico auto accident. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A clear example would be if you suffered a broken foot, your dental records would not be relevant to proving or disproving your case—even if you suffered from a serious condition like periodontal disease. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>However, if you suffered a broken foot and claimed that you can no longer go running or engage in other physical activities due to the way the injury healed or still hurts you, your medical records related to a back injury or neck injury—even if totally unrelated—may still be relevant and deemed waived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meaning that you would need to disclose these records.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because a back or neck injury would affect your ability to run or engage in physical activity. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Additionally, it is important to note that individuals suffering from a brain injury such as a traumatic brain injury, may be required to provide all of their medical records.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because it is commonly alleged that a brain injury affects a person’s daily and customary activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thus, any type of impairments related to your health, including even periodontal disease, could affect the value of your case and may be deemed waived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meaning you would need to disclose these medical records as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is not a blanket rule, and there may be exceptions, but this is generally the applicable rule.</p><h3><b>Injured in a New Mexico Auto Accident?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Learn How We Can Help Protect All Your Rights</b></h3><p>One aspect of your personal injury case that most lawyers fail to do is protect your rights, all of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many lawyers will just throw out any of your medical records that are requested, even if irrelevant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here

<h2><b>Understanding High Speed Collisions Caused by Excessive Speed: Albuquerque Auto Accident Lawyer</b></h2><p>One of the most significant and catastrophic types of auto accidents are high speed collisions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because high speed collisions result in significant force and momentum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This force is dispersed through the vehicles causing the metal of a car to twist or break.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This force is also dispersed into occupants, resulting in broken bones, ruptured organs, and other severe damages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have been seriously injured in a high speed collision, our Albuquerque auto accident lawyer can explain what your rights are when the other driver was speeding or driving above the speed limit.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque auto accident lawyer</a> knows that excessive speed is a common and very serious cause of catastrophic motor vehicle accidents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our staff is trained and has experience handling these types of cases and the commonly caused injuries, including traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, broken bones, ruptured organs, and many other types of injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have been seriously injured in a New Mexico auto accident, please call us to schedule a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><h3><b>Excessive Speed Causing a Serious Albuquerque Auto Accident</b></h3><p>Under New Mexico common law, all motorists must use reasonable care under the circumstances in the use and operation of their motor vehicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The common law is judge-made law which is developed over decades of judicial decision-making premised on the consensus of the public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is an important part of law which can be used to determine when a defendant is negligent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Negligence is when there is a duty owed by defendant to the plaintiff, who breaches that duty and such breach causes damages to the plaintiff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That duty is what a reasonable person, or a reasonable member of society, would do in similar circumstances. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Thus, if a defendant is driving above the speed limit and causes a serious <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico auto accident</a>, that defendant could be liable for negligence based on the common law principle.</p><p>But there is also another cause of action for statutory violations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because there is <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-301/">NM stat. section 66-7-301</a>, wherein subdivision (d) provides that “[i]n every event, speed shall be so controlled by the driver as may be necessary: (1) to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle or other conveyance on or entering the highway; (2) to comply with legal requirements as may be established by the state highway and transportation department or the New Mexico state police division of department of public safety and the duty of all persons to use due car . . . .”</p><p>If a defendant fails to comply with the statute and causes a catastrophic auto accident resulting in permanent injuries or wrongful death, a victim may be entitled to compensation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using the violation of this statute can help establish liability automatically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is because of the doctrine of negligence per se, which finds that the violation of a statute meant to protect a plaintiff who is injured by that violation will be able to hold the defendant automatically liable for the crash.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a very important and useful tool against drivers who are speeding and cause auto accidents.</p><h3><b>Victims of High Speed New Mexico Auto Accident Could Call Our Law Firm Today</b></h3><p>If you have suffered a very serious injury from a New Mexico auto accident, please call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque auto accident lawyer</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

damage and cognitive damage.  Head injuries include any injury to a victim’s head, face, brain, skull, or scalp.  There are generally two types of head injuries.  One is an open head injury, which is where the skull is fractured.  A closed head injury is where the skull does not break, but there is damage to the brain itself.  Both types of head injuries are very dangerous, particularly closed head injuries which do not allow for blood or swelling to escape and can create extreme pressure on the brain also damaging it.</p><p>Below are some of the most common types of head injuries in New Mexico trucking crashes:</p><p><b>Trauma Injuries </b>– When you have a large commercial truck colliding with a smaller passenger vehicle, one of the most common types of head injuries to a victim is a trauma-related injury such as lacerations, cuts, tearing of flesh, foreign objects, and other head damage.  This is physical damage to the head that we usually think of in vehicle crashes caused by the impact.  This can include physical damage to the skull and brain due to the impact.</p><p><b>Concussions</b> – a concussion occurs when the brain bounces against the skull which causes damage to it.  This can result in a loss of cognitive function and cause severe headaches.  These can also cause permanent damage and destroy a person’s ability to function normally and hold a job.</p><p><b>Traumatic brain injuries</b> – these are a type of brain injury caused by the <a href="https://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking crash</a>, but not necessarily in the acute, physical sense that the first common type occurs.  Traumatic brain injuries, or TBIs, can occur without any physical signs of damage.  The brain can be injured in a jostling motion like a concussion, and be deprived oxygen or blood in a section where it will begin to die or atrophy.  TBIs can also result in permanent loss of memory, ability to speak, ability to even walk or talk, and a loss of control of one’s emotions.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries are very serious damages</a>.</p><p><b>Skull fractures</b> – a skull fracture is a very scary type of head injury because the skull is the protective shell of the brain.  When the skull is fractured, it can leave the brain vulnerable to damage.  When the skull is severely fractured, it can actually do the harm to the brain itself by piercing and damaging the brain.  Skull fractures are always dangerous and need to be guarded against.</p><p><b>Loss of sight, hearing, or taste</b> – head injuries can also cause damage to a person’s senses, particularly the eyes which are very vulnerable to shattered and flying glass, tossed debris, and other shrapnel in a trucking crash.  Victims can also suffer severe damage to their hearing and taste when cranial nerves are also injured.</p><p><b>Injured in a New Mexico Tractor Trailer Crash Causing a Head Injury?

<p><b>Common Catastrophic Injuries from New Mexico Trucking Wrecks and How They May Work in Court</b></p><p>All motor vehicle crashes can result in serious personal injuries, but <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking crashes</a> can lead to some of the most catastrophic injuries that a victim could endure.  These injuries include horrific head, brain, and spine injuries, or significant organ issues which can result in a systematic shutdown of someone’s body.  Extreme bloodless and trauma to a limb can also result in the need to amputate the limb.  These types of injuries are very common in New Mexico trucking crashes due to the size, weight, and speed these vehicles travel.</p><p>Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking wreck lawyers at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> have handled many significant trucking crashes resulting in these types of catastrophic injuries.  We know how to support and injured victim and his or her family to present his or her case in the best possible light to recover the maximum amount of compensation he or she may be entitled to.  If you or a loved one were seriously injured or wrongfully killed, call us by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn more how we can help you and your family.</p><p><b>Most Common Catastrophic Injuries in New Mexico Trucking Wrecks Caused by Negligent Truck Drivers</b></p><p>When serious and catastrophic injuries are caused by the negligence of another it can make you feel frustrated, angry, and even hopeless.  These injuries are usually permanent, extremely debilitating, and horrific for victims and their families.  Some of the most <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">common catastrophic injuries from New Mexico trucking wrecks</a> which our New Mexico trucking wreck lawyer handles include the following two worst injuries:</p><p><b>Head and brain injuries</b> – <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Injuries to the head such as traumatic brain injuries</a> warrant special consideration and attention.  This if because, first, injuries to the head can easily kill a victim of a trucking wreck.  The brain governs the entire body, and injuries here can result in the wrongful death of a person.  Second, injuries to the head and brain are not always easily diagnosed and require neurological testing and experts to prove.  This is because injuries to your cognitive ability to process information, remember, focus, and even function normally do not show up in an x-ray.  Third, head and brain injuries can also damage and control all aspects of your body even with little injuries, which mean that head injuries can effect nerves and parts of your body on the opposite end such as your legs or feet.  All head and brain injuries are very serious examples of catastrophic personal injuries.</p><p><b>Loss of Limb from Amputation or Paralysis</b> – Anytime a victim loses a limb, either physically in an amputation or functionally due to paralysis such as due to paraplegia or quadriplegia, a victim’s entire life will change greatly.  These are very serious and significant injuries which cannot be brought back.  Sometimes everything that a victim previously could do now requires assistance after the injury.  In very severe cases, victims can be completely bedridden or wheelchair bound after enjoying an active life.  This can have dramatic effects on a person’s future life expectancy, income and lost wages, and even his or her emotional well-being.  These are one of the worst catastrophic injuries which are very common in <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking wrecks</a>, particularly on highways or interstates.</p><p><b>Catastrophic Injured From New Mexico Trucking Wrecks Require Strong and Experienced Legal Advocacy</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Recent Albuquerque Police Car Car Killing a Young Boy Highlights the Dangerous in  New Mexico Car Accidents with Emergency Vehicles</b></p><p>We are learning more from an <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1068531/bcso-officer-driving-almost-80-mph-before-crash-that-killed-boy.html">investigation report of an April 17, 2017 </a>motor vehicle crash in Albuquerque, New Mexico wherein an Albuquerque police officer was responding to call of a man wielding a machete in a local store.  The officer was traveling at approximately 80 MPH on his way to the scene with his lights and sirens on.  He approached an intersection where he had a green light.  Another vehicle, which also had the green light, was turning left at the intersection.  The officer applied his brakes but collided into the rear of the vehicle turning left.  A young boy, Joel Anthony Suina (6-years-old) was killed and his 9-year-old sister suffered a pelvis fracture, a head injury, lung injury, liver injury, and kidney injury.</p><p>Here at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we see too many of these types of crashes.  We honor and respect our law enforcement to the fullest, but we also recognize their jobs bring peril.  Generally, emergency vehicles are commonly involved in New Mexico car crashes not solely due to the actions of an officer, but due to the natural and inherent danger of this line of work.  Any vehicle speeding and growing through an intersection is a dangerous vehicle, even with the green light.  If you or a loved one have been injured in an emergency vehicle crash in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, or anywhere else in <a href="/Contact.shtml">New Mexico, call our experienced personal injury lawyer for a FREE consultation</a> by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn more.</p><p><b>Dangers of Intersections and High Speeds</b></p><p>The causes of car accidents can be viewed as a recipe for disaster.  Several ingredients just make car accidents much more potent to cause <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">serious injury or wrongful death</a>.  Intersections are the most dangerous location on the roadway because lanes of traffic are crossing over other lanes of traffic creating the potential for a collision.  Speed is also a dangerous factor, as the reaction time goes down but the braking distance increases.  The force and momentum is also greater and stronger.</p><p>Emergency vehicles commonly invoke both of these added dangerous, such as the news story from above.  In fact, intersections are known to be one of the most dangerous locations for any emergency vehicle—especially when the light is against the emergency vehicle.  Here, even though the light was not against the driver, it still lead to a very deadly accident.</p><p><b>Liability in Emergency Vehicle Crashes</b></p><p>When an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">emergency vehicle is involved in a motor vehicle crash in New Mexico</a>, there could be many liable parties.  The most basic and common party is the driver of the emergency vehicle.  Another common entity that is liable is the police department or agency, which is vicariously liable for the acts of its employees within the scope of employment.  Here, the police department could absolutely be liable for the subject crash because the crash occurred within the drivers course of employment and while responding to the crash.</p><p>Unfortunately, another person who could be liable is the driver of the vehicle turning left.  The 6-year-old and the 9-year-old were passengers, and not comparatively at fault for this accident in any way.  But there could be, however, liability for the driver for not noticing the sirens or lights at an intersection.  This may be very unlikely given the facts, but it is a possibility which must be taken into consideration to protect the rights of the injured children at all cost.</p><p><b>Crashes with Emergency Vehicles are Very Serious: Call a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Personal Injury Lawyer</a> if This Happened to You</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C</a>. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact us</a> on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Who Could be Responsible for a New Mexico Trucking Wreck?  Answer: A Lot of People and Entities!</b></p><p>Victims of New Mexico trucking wrecks usually end up being seriously injured, especially when those crashes are high-speed collisions on interstates such as I-40, I-25, or I-10.  While victims and their families usually turn to healing and getting life back on track, the importance of preparing for a legal battle in court may seem so far away.  But the statute of limitations in New Mexico is <a href="http://codes.findlaw.com/nm/chapter-37-limitation-of-actions-abatement-and-revivor/nm-st-sect-37-1-8.html">only 3 years from the date of the accident</a>, which will creep up quickly on victims who are seriously injured and require years of recovery.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to have an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorney such as the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> on your side right from the start.  We can help take the burdens off of you and your family so you can focus on healing, and we will focus on preparing your case against the individuals or entities liable for your trucking wreck.  When you are involved in a New Mexico trucking wreck in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe, Roswell, or anywhere else in New Mexico, call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help you.</p><p><b>Who is Liable for a Trucking Wreck?</b></p><p>There are many different individuals and entities who may be liable for a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking wreck</a>.  Some of these parties may be obvious, but some of these may not be that obvious at all to a lay person.  Here are some of the people who may be liable for a New Mexico trucking crash:</p><ul><li><b>The Truck Driver</b> – it should be obvious that the person who is most likely to be liable for a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking wreck</a> would be the driver of the truck.  Drivers must have a CDL and spent time studying, passing a written test, shadowing a licensed driver, and then passing a field tests before they get their licenses.  Drivers of large commercial trucks have very dangerous machines in their hands and they must be very careful how they operate those vehicles.  When a truck driver makes a bad decision such as a reckless one, negligent one, or even a downright dangerous decision, it can result in serious injuries and the wrongful death of a victim.  Truck drivers are usually at the center of all defendants in trucking accident litigation.</li><li><b>The Trucking Company</b> – just as the truck driver is most obvious, it should also not be a surprise that the trucking company is send-most obvious.  This is because the trucking company will be liable for any truck wrecks of their drivers under the theory of respondeat superior, a type of vicarious liability between the employer and employee.  This means that the employer will be liable for the acts of an employee when they occur within the scope of employment.  Trucking companies can also be liable for negligently hiring a driver, negligently training a driver, and providing faulty equipment such as the trucks.</li><li><b>Other drivers</b> – another common cause of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking crashes</a> is the acts of negligence of another driver, such as those that may cut off a truck and cause it to swerve or of a car that stops short.  This can be very serious and result in catastrophic injury when there are two vehicles involved.  Additionally, if the victim is a passenger in a vehicle, the driver of that vehicle could be liable for the negligence.</li><li><b>Equipment manufacturers</b> <b>– </b>if a component on the truck like a piece of equipment is negligently made, like tires, brakes, or the steering wheel, the manufacturer could also be liable under a products liability case to the victim.</li><li><b>Government entities </b>– maybe a cause of the subject trucking crash is not just due to the trucking company or truck drier, but maybe the road is improperly rated for too high a speed, or the road is very dimly lit, or maybe even there are holes in the roadway which cause tire blowouts.  All of these are examples of issues that could result in the local municipality, county, state, or even federal government to be liable.</li></ul><p><b>There Could be Others Liable for Your New Mexico Trucking Crash: Call Us Today To Learn More About Your Rights!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Backing Up Without Looking: Dangerous and Deadly Albuquerque Trucking Crashes</b></p><p>When we think of a trucking wreck, we think of a high-speed collision which twists and churns metal.  We think of jackknifed trucks and rolled over passenger vehicles.  And we think of powerful impacts like explosions on the roadway.  But what we do not think of is backing up truck accidents.  However, due to their sheer size and weight, a large commercial truck which is backing up has a lot of momentum and force behind it.  Whatever it hits will be significantly damaged, even at a low speed.</p><p>Victims of trucking crashes caused by a large commercial truck backing up in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Santa Fe, Roswell, and anywhere else in New Mexico should call the experienced <a href="/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking crash attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> to learn how we can help protect your rights to compensation by dialing (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation.</p><p><b>Proving Liability When a Truck Backs Into Your Vehicle and Causes Serious Injury</b></p><p>There are two main ways to prove liability when a large commercial truck backs into your vehicle and causes serious personal injuries in a New Mexico trucking crash.</p><p>The first is under the common law doctrine of negligence, which is judge-made law.  A <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">victim of a trucking wreck</a> will be able to recover compensation when he or she is injured due to the negligence of a truck driver who causes the injuries.  Negligence occurs when a defendant does not drive with reasonable care under the circumstances.  Backing into another vehicle is not using reasonable care.</p><p>The second way to prove liability in a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking crash</a> is under the theory of negligence per se.  This is when a defendant violates a statute which is meant to protect the victim, and the defendant’s violation ends up causing injuries.  Under New Mexico law, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-354/">NM Stat. 66-7-354 (a)</a> provides that “[t]he driver of a vehicle shall not back it unless the movement can be made with reasonably safety and without interfering with other traffic.”  When a truck driver backs up and cases a trucking crash, he or she will have violated the statute and be negligent per se.  This allows the victim to recover compensation for all injuries directly caused by the crash.</p><p><b>Common Injuries in an Albuquerque Trucking Crash Caused by Backing Up</b></p><p>When an 18 wheeler, big rig, tractor trailer, semi, or other large commercial truck backs into another vehicle, there can be very serious injuries even in a low speed collision.  Some common injuries include the following:</p><ul><li><a href="/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries</a>;</li><li>Fractures;</li><li>Organ ruptures or injuries;</li><li>Spinal cord injuries;</li><li>Amputations;</li><li>Paralysis;</li><li>Significant deformities;</li><li>Loss of vision;</li><li>Orbital blowout fractures;</li><li>Decapitation;</li><li>Nerve injuries;</li><li><a href="/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">Wrongful death;</a> and</li><li>Many other types of injuries.</li></ul><p><b>Victims of Albuquerque Trucking Wrecks Caused When a Truck Backs Into Him or Her Need to Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact us</a> on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Crash on I-25: Concrete Mixing Truck Blows Tire and Flips in Las Cruces—Serious Injuries Avoided</b></p><p>All large commercial trucks are dangerous.  <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2017/09/29/concrete-mixing-truck-crash-closed-25-most-friday/718611001/">News sources are reporting</a> that a large concrete mixing truck blew a tire and flipped on its side.  The large truck blocked Interstate 25 on Friday, September 29, 2017.  Luckily, no one was seriously injured or killed in this trucking crash.  However, that just means this time.  A few weeks ago we posted how a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/new-mexico-truck-driver-killed-in-interstate-wreck-due-to-tire-blowout-causing-fiery-crash/">truck driver was killed when his truck blew a tired and crashed into a rock formation</a>.  Other news stories we have reported were when a truck had lost a tire and seriously injured or killed other drivers or occupants.</p><p>But it is not just news stories.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking crash attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> have handled many trucking wreck cases where many victims have been killed due to a tire blow out.  We have also handled many cases involving tankers or other transport vehicles.  These vehicles are dangerous, and the results of negligent conduct can be fatal to those on or around the roads.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed in a New Mexico trucking crash, please call us for a FREE consultation by dating (505) 883-5000 to learn what your rights may be.</p><p><b>Scary Facts of Concrete Truck Crash on I-25</b></p><p>Las Cruces is one of the busiest trucking hubs in New Mexico.  This is because I-10 and I-25, which both run in opposite north-south and east-west directions, search as a place where trucks can switch directions.  This coupled with the fact that Las Cruces has a large population just means roads are congested and busy where large trucks weave in and hour.  The speed limit on these roads is also high, as they are interstates, therefore traffic also moves very quick.</p><p>What make this case scary—and lucky that no one was seriously injured—is because a concrete truck is incredibly heavy.  Anything that it collides with at full speed on an interstate will be pulverized.  The fact that the truck flipped on its side is also lucky that no other vehicle was to the side of it, as that vehicle would be completely flattened.  The large size of this vehicle and weight it has is simply devastating and dangerous.</p><p>And this type of <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking wreck</a> should not have occurred!  This was caused by a tire blowout.  Tires are equipment of a large truck which must be checked constantly to ensure the treads are not worn out, separating, or otherwise damaged.  Tires are obviously very important for any vehicle, but for a large commercial truck they are incredibly important because they disperse pressure and weight.</p><p>Any <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Las Cruces or New Mexico trucking crash</a> caused by a tire blowout which results in personal injuries could be fatal and cause serious injuries.  Victims injured when a large commercial truck’s tire explodes should always have an attorney investigate the facts to determine whether the tire was improperly maintained.</p><p><b>Victims of Tire Blowouts on I-25 in Las Cruces Should Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Tanker Truckers Poise Unique Dangers and Are Very Dangerous in New Mexico Trucking Crashes</b></p><p>All large commercial trucks are very dangerous, including 18 wheelers, semis, double trailers, flatbeds, tandems, tractor trailers, and other trucks.  But some of the most dangerous commercial trucks are tanker trucks—particularly those carrying liquids.  Why?  Think about a gallon of milk.  This weighs about 9 pounds.  The average tanker truck can hold 9,000 gallons.  This weighs about 81,000 pounds.  Combine that with the fast speed on an interstate, along with the heavy steel tanker, engine, wheels, and other parts, and you have a lot of momentum of force which must be dispersed on a collision.</p><p>Not to mention that upon that collision, there is a chance that the liquid being transported could rupture.  If that liquid is caustic like an acid, it could cause very serious injuries to victims sprayed with it in a collision.  If that liquid is flammable, it could result in an excruciating and incredibly painful death due to fire.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we handle <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious New Mexico trucking crashes</a> caused by tanker trucks which injure, maim, or kill innocent victims.  Our experienced trucking wreck attorneys are trained in both the law and trucking, as well as being skilled and knowledgable with personal injury and medical cases, and we work hard to represent those in need of zealous legal representation.  Call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help you.</p><p><b>Tanker Trucks Crashes in New Mexico: Two Dangers to Know</b></p><p>The first danger in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico tanker crash</a> is the collision itself.  The sheer force of impact in any motor vehicle crash is dangerous.  But in tanker crashes, the speed and weight can result in catastrophic injuries.  The result can be completely devastating to a victim and his or her family.  Any trauma as a result of the impact will leave serious damage.</p><p>The second danger in a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico tanker wreck</a> is what it was carrying, the load.  Even a load of just water can present very serious dangerous, including drowning victims who are trapped in a vehicle.  But the real danger is when the load is something more deadly like acids, chemicals, or gasoline.  All of these can cause very serious burning injuries on their own, and when there is combustion the fire can be even more deadly and result in fire injuries.</p><p><b>Tanker Truck Crashes in New Mexico Are Very Deadly and Dangerous</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When 18 Wheelers Change Lanes, It is Always Dangerous.  When 18 Wheelers Change Lanes at the Last Second, it Can Cause a Deadly Albuquerque Trucking Crash</b></p><p>Some of the most dangerous times when driving are when you are entering into or across another lane of traffic.  This is why intersections are so dangerous.  Any left turns, whether at an intersection, into a parking lot, or merging into traffic are also dangerous.  This also means that lane changes are incredibly very dangerous, particularly on fast-moving roads like interstates I-40, I-25, and I-10.  These are some of the fastest moving roads in New Mexico, if not the entire country, which have multiple lanes.  Because these roads are so important to transporting goods across the country, many trucking companies use these highways like Schneider National, J.B. Hunt, and FedEx.</p><p>Therefore, when you combine large commercial trucks like 18 wheelers, fast roads like interstates, and multiple lanes, you end up with wrecks due to last second lane changes causing serious trucking wrecks.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque trucking crash attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> have fought some of the largest trucking companies in the country who have improperly changed lanes at the last second and caused serious trucking wrecks seriously injuries or killing innocent victims.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed in a trucking crash, please call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help you.</p><p><b>Liability in a Last Second Lane Change by a Large Commercial Truck</b></p><p>When it comes to traffic incident such as an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking crash</a>, one thing that police officers, lawyers, and judges will look at is how had possession of the lane in the road when the accident occurred.  This is important because the person who has a lane is entitled to it.  Anyone who is attempting to cross the lane or merge into the lane must do so safely and cannot do so if it would impede the progression of another vehicle.</p><p>In fact, this is what our Legislature has codified under New Mexico’s vehicle and traffic laws.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-317/">NM Stat. 66-7-317</a>, subdivision (a) provides that “a vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.”</p><p>When a driver fails to do this, the driver will be liable under the doctrine of negligence per se.  This is an important legal tool for your case which provides that the violation of a statute which causes harm to a person protected by the statute can obtain compensation by the violator for any damages caused by the accident.  This is a way for a victim to win an <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking crash</a>.</p><p><b>Last Second Lane Changes in Large Commercial Trucks Kill Innocent Victims: Protect Your Rights Here</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact us</a> on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Proving a Trucking Crash Case Takes Strong Evidence and a Good Attorney: Learn What Evidence is Used to Help Win Your Case from an Albuquerque 18 Wheeler Crash Lawyer</b></p><p>Evidence is the way that you prove any claim in court.  Even the strongest of cases require evidence to support your claim.  That is because our judicial system is an adversarial system, meaning two sides go against each other to prosecute or defend a claim.  To do this, our system only allows certain evidence to prove or disapprove a case.  This is a very complicated process, as only certain evidence is admissible.  There are entire classes in law school which just deal with evidence, some courses are even a year long and they still will not review all of the applicable evidence rules, types, of methods.</p><p>In general, evidence can take several different forms.  This includes the testimony of a witness who saw a trucking accident and is providing what he or she observed.  Or the testimony of an expert witness who takes the facts and applies accepted science or other principles to prove or disprove a claim.  Other evidence can be photographs that fairly and accurately depict the scene, or medical records of a victim.  Actual objects from the crash scene can also be evidence, for instance something such as a wheel or damage brake system.</p><p>In <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accident cases</a> there are even more types of accident which might be used to help prove a case to win as an injured plaintiff.  This includes a wide range of different mediums, including purely electronic information.</p><p><b>18 Wheeler Crash Evidence to be Used Against the Truck Driver</b></p><p>Evidence can be used to hold a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/practice-areas/trucking-accident-overview/truck-driver-error/">truck driver liable for an Albuquerque trucking crash</a>.  All truck drivers require a CDL license.  This is a very involved application process which requires written tests and road tests, as well as background checks and other evaluations.  This results in a “file” of the driver, which can be used to determine what problems he or she has had operating a truck.  Previous crashes or accidents may also be in the file and can be used to look for a pattern of mistakes.</p><p>Truck drivers are also required to keep hours of service documentation.  This is also known as a logbook, which includes all of the time that a driver has been driving or resting.  There are certain federal regulations which govern how long a truck driver can consecutively drive.  Using this logbook could be helpful to determine if the truck driver has had adequate rest, or if fatigue may have caused the subject crash.</p><p>Also under federal regulations, where there are <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious or fatal injuries in a trucking crash</a> the truck driver must go through drug and alcohol screening.  This can also be used to determine whether these factors contributed to the subject crash.</p><p><b>Evidence from Trucking Crashes Against the Truck Driver and on the Vehicle</b></p><p>Holding a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/practice-areas/trucking-accident-overview/trucking-company-liability/">trucking company liable for a New Mexico trucking crash</a> can be done through evidence as well.  Not only does a truck driver need to keep a logbook of his or her hours of operation, but on board computers for a truck now record when the vehicle is in operation or at rest.  This can be used to determine whether or not the truck driver is violating the hours of service rules.  If the truck driver is lying, it can be a huge credibility issue to help prove your case.</p><p>The on-board computers also keep many other data that is important to support a claim.  This comes from the ECM, or engine control module, which records how fast the truck is moving, what direct, what lights or signals were on, whether the driver was accelerating or braking, and many other vital statistics.  These statistics are perfect to prove your trucking accident case.</p><p>All trucks also must maintain a maintenance and inspection history documentation.  This can show what has been repaired—or what has been neglected—and when and who performed the checks or maintenance.  This allows victims to point to other factors, such as the defective nature of the truck, to help prove a claim.</p><p><b>Evidence in 18 Wheeler Wrecks Can be

<p><b>New Mexico 18 Wheeler Wrecks Can Cause Serious Injuries to Other Driver Truck Drivers Who are Co-drivers, Sleeping in the Cabin, or being Taxied Back Home</b></p><p>When we think of trucking crashes, the most common victims we think are those in passenger vehicles.  And for good reason, because passenger vehicles are much smaller than a large commercial truck and occupants of passenger vehicles usually get serious injured, maimed, or killed.  But when we think of trucking crashes, we do not normally think of injuries to other truck drivers.  When in fact it is not uncommon for long trips across the country to have two drivers.  One will rest in the cabin and sleep while the other one drives to avoid an hours of service violation.  But if the driver ends up falling asleep or causing a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking crash</a>, the sleeping co-driver can be seriously injured or killed.</p><p>This is exactly what happened in a FedEx crash that the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> handled.  The truck driver fell asleep at the wheel and the co-driver sleeping in the cabin compartment was killed in the collision.  We represented the family of the deceased and were able to recover compensation.  If you or a loved one have been injured in a trucking crash, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced Albuquerque trucking wreck attorneys</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help you obtain the compensation you may deserve.</p><p><b>Truck Drivers Killed by New Mexico 18 Wheeler Wrecks: Not Just New Mexico Drivers!</b></p><p>New Mexico has some of the busiest and most important interstates for coast to coast shipping.  I-10, I-25, and I-40 provide east to west and north to south routes for trucking companies, with major junctions in Las Cruces and Albuquerque to switch directions.  Because of this, many of the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking crashes in New Mexico</a> are not always caused by New Mexico trucking companies and involve New Mexico truck drivers.  Some of the largest trucking companies in the country, including FedEx, J.B. Hunt, UPS, Schneider National, and other motor carriers use these roads.</p><p>Because the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">accident occurs in New Mexico</a>, and usually because it involves at least one person from New Mexico, the venue (or place where the case and be brought) will be in New Mexico.  This means out of state people may be involved with a New Mexico trucking wreck trial, and here at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. that is normal!</p><p>Given New Mexico’s close proximity to California, we frequently represent truck drivers who are seriously injured or killed in trucking crashes from Ontario, Upland, and San Bernardino, California.  This is a major trucking hub where many companies operate out of and where truck drivers live.</p><p><b>Truck Driver?

<p><b>Albuquerque Trucking Crashes Causing Traumatic Brain Injuries: Common Causes to Know </b></p><p>Other than wrongful death, which is the ultimate personal injury, a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">traumatic brain injury</a> has to be the worst type of personal injury that a person can sustain in an Albuquerque trucking crash.  Traumatic brain injuries can have a laundry list of complications, ranging from minor memory troubles and headaches, to significant cognitive functioning ability.  In severe cases, a victim could go into a vegetative state and be unable to consciously function.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we handle traumatic brain injury cases from any type of personal injury accident.  This could be from a slip and fall or something more serious like an 18 wheeler wreck.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured and sustained a traumatic brain injury, call us today to learn how we can help you recover the compensation you deserve by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Two Causes of Traumatic Brain Injuries </b></p><p>When it comes to brain injuries, there are really two main causes.  The first is probably what you immediately think of when you think of a traumatic brain injury—trauma.  That is a strike to the head caused by a blunt force.  This could result in something like a concussion, or something more serious like permanent damage.  Trauma and physical force is one of the most common mechanisms of brain injuries in <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">Albuquerque trucking crashes</a>.</p><p>The second way to cause a traumatic brain injury is due to a lack of oxygen.  The brain is very fragile and demands a lot of oxygen.  When there is a lack of oxygen, or a hypoxic state, the brain can quickly become damaged and die.  This can be caused by some force like twisted metal or debris pressing against the throat to prevent air from going down or against the chest so that the lungs cannot expand.  Or this can be caused by physiological factors, such as extreme blood loss, low pressure, or shock which affect the way that oxygen is transported throughout the body.  This is why <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking wrecks causing traumatic brain injuries</a> are so dangerous.</p><p><b>Common Causes of Traumatic Brain Injuries in Albuquerque Trucking Crashes</b></p><p>There are many causes of <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">traumatic brain injuries in trucking crashes</a> occurring in New Mexico, but here are some of the most common causes that all motorist should be aware of.  These include the following:</p><ul><li>Rear end collisions;</li><li>T-bone crashes;</li><li>Head on collisions;</li><li>Roll-overs;</li><li>Jackknife tractor trailers;</li><li>Sideswipes;</li><li>Improper lane change collisions;</li><li>Ran a stop side crash;</li><li>Failure to yield collisions;</li><li>Improper merging collisions;</li><li>Unsafe cargo crashes;</li><li>Excessive speed causing a wreck; and</li><li>Many other cases.</li></ul><p><b>Victims With Traumatic Brain Injuries from Albuquerque Trucking Crashes Need to Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.

<p><b>I Was Injured in a New Mexico Trucking Wreck, What Damages Can I Recover?</b></p><p>Victims of New Mexico trucking crashes are some of the worst injured, most damaged, and most financially punished for the negligence by another person than any other type of motor vehicle crash.  All <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking wrecks</a>, even low-speed or grazed collisions, will cause significant personal injuries to a victim.  These are large commercial vehicles which significant weight and speed to them, especially on an interstate like I-40, I-25, or I-10, which can easily crush, bend, and twist steel vehicles.  The damage they can do to the soft human body is absolutely devastating.</p><p>Here are the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque 18 wheeler wreck attorneys</a> know how catastrophic the injuries to victims in these crashes can be.  We have the knowledge and experience in acquiring compensation for these victims in all types of truck crashes, including 18 wheelers, tankers, double trailers, semis, and other big rigs.  We have ligated cases against some of the largest trucking companies in the United States, including J.B. Hunt, FedEx, and Schneider.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed in a New Mexico trucking wreck, call us today for a FREE consultation to learn what damages you may be entitled to by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Damages in New Mexico Trucking Crashes: What You Should Know </b></p><p>A <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">victim of a New Mexico trucking crash</a> will be entitled to damages if the victim can prove that the truck driver and/or truck company breached its duty of care which proximately caused damages to the victim.  All motorists have a duty to use reasonable care under the circumstances in the use and operation of his or her motor vehicle.  When a truck driver fails to do that, it will result in the breach of the duty.</p><p>Thus, a victim in a trucking crash will be able to recover compensation for this breach for all damages.  The most common types of damages that a victim may be entitled to include the following:</p><p><b>Pain and Suffering</b>: The actual feelings of pain, suffering, and agony are known as non-economic damages.  A victim can be compensated for an accident which causes him or her pain and suffering.  This is awarded by a jury in a trial, or by a judge in a bench trial.  The pain and suffering will be past pain and suffering from all injuries from the date of the accident to the award.  Future pain and suffering may also be awarded for all pain and suffering from the date of the award until the person’s estimate life expectancy.  This is the most common type of damage that people think of for personal injury lawsuits.</p><p><b>Lost Wages</b> – A <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">victim of a trucking crash</a> will likely be so injured that he or she will not be able to return to work for days, weeks, months, or even years.  Because the victim cannot go to work, he or she will have lost wages from not working.  These lost days from work can be compensated in court by the amount the victim would have earned.</p><p><b>Lost Earnings</b> – When a victim is so injured that he or she cannot return to the same job and must take a different job that pays less, the victim will have lost earnings.  The lost earnings is the difference between the income levels.  For example, a victim of a trucking crash who sustains a broken back may not be able to return to work as a construction worker.  The victim may than have to take a desk job that he or she is not qualified for because the victim was trained as a laborer, thus the victim may not be paid as well.  This difference is what can be compensated.</p><p><b>Medical Bills</b> – A victim of any motor vehicle crash may also be entitled to medical bills from his or her accident.  These medical bills can be rather significant, particularly if there are multiple surgeries or procedures which must be performed.</p><p><b>Loss of Services/Consortium</b> – The victim and his or her spouse or dependents (children, elderly parents), may also recover what is known as loss of services.  That is, since the victim is unable to function in the household to the same level he or she could before the accident, the other people in the victim’s life will be able to recover compensation for the victim’s inability to help.  This can be something simple as household chores like cutting the lawn which can no longer be done and a landscaper must be hired, or something more complex like loss of love and affection.</p><p><b>Property Damage</b> – Victims of trucking crashes will likely have their motor vehicle totaled or damaged significantly to a point where it will create a financial burden on the family and victim.  The negligence defendant can also be required to compensation the victim for the property damage to the victim’s vehicle or possessions.</p><p><b>Damages in New Mexico Trucking Crashes Can be Significant: Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.

<p><b>Eating, Playing With the Radio, and Using a GPS While Driving a Large Commercial Truck Can Result in Deadly New Mexico Trucking Crashes</b></p><p><a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving">According to statistics</a>, annually distracted driving kills approximately 3,500 people and injures almost 400,000.  When we think of distracted driving, we usually think of cell phones. And for good reason, because drivers using a cell phone to text or call while driving are 6 times more likely to be involved in a motor vehicle accident <i>than drunk driving</i>.  This is a very serious problem—and a rather scary one at that.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we handle distracted driving truck crashes in Las Cruces, Albuquerque, Roswell, Santa Fe, and anywhere else in New Mexico.  We represent New Mexico hurt by trucking crashes, but also victims coming through our interstates like I-40, I-25, and I-10 such as those coming from Ontario, California.  If you or a loved one was hurt in a New Mexico trucking crash, call us today for a FREE consultation to learn how we can protect your rights by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Distracted Driving is More Than Just Cell Phones: New Mexico Trucking Crashes Cause by Distracted Driving is Deadly</b></p><p>Cell phone use while driving is dangerous.  But people do not realize that other distractions in a motor vehicle can also be dangerous.  Many of these distractions plague truck drivers, who are extremely likely to seriously injure or kill someone in any <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">type of trucking accident</a>.  Some of these dangerous distractions include the following:</p><p><b>Eating</b> – eating while driving is dangerous because it takes at least one hand off of the wheel.  It will also take you eyes off the wheel momentarily to grab the food.  Your attention will also be pulled off of the road, which further is dangerous and can be deadly.  Eating while driving is very distracting and very dangerous, and it is one of the more common types of distracted driving that kills people.  Truck drivers eat while they drive because they need to make deliveries as fast as they can, so they really don’t want to stop to eat because time is money.  <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking crashes</a> caused by eating while driving is deadly.</p><p><b>Hand radio</b> – truck drivers frequently communication with hand radios.  These hand radios take at least one hand off the wheel and a driver’s attention from the road and to the conversation on the radio.  A driver’s attention may also be diverted by pulling away the driver’s eyes to change stations.  Hand radios are very dangerous while driving large commercial trucks.</p><p><b>GPS</b> – sometimes truck drivers are traveling in a direction that they do not know where they are going.  It could be a new route or a new place for deliveries.  Therefore, a GPS system will be needed to help determine where they are going.  Some trucking companies even require truck drivers to use a GPS system to ensure they are using the most direct and efficient route.  But these devices take a driver’s attention, eyes, and hands off the wheel.</p><p><b>Hurt in a New Mexico Trucking Crash?  Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.

<p><b>New Mexico Truck Crashes When 18 Wheelers Hit Disabled Vehicles on the Side of the Road: What Are Your Rights?</b></p><p>No one plans for their vehicle to break down.  But unfortunately this does occur to everyone at some time or another.  The side of the road is a dangerous place to be, especially on a busy interstate like I-40, I-25, or I-10.  Vehicles traveling on these interstates are traveling very fast and usually over the speed limit.  Large commercial trucks like 18 wheelers also frequently use the interstates in New Mexico to deliver goods from coast-to-coast.  This makes the side of the road even <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">more dangerous on interstates</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, many disabled vehicles on the side of the road are involved in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">serious motor vehicle crashes</a>.  When these crashes with disabled vehicles involve large commercial trucks like 18 wheelers, big rigs, tandem trailer, tractor trailers, semis, and other trucks, victims can be seriously injured or killed.  Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know that victims in a disabled vehicle who are struck by a large commercial truck do not have a fair chance.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorney</a> represent these victims zealously, with compassion, and with the requisite skill to get victims the compensation they deserve.</p><p><b>When Commercial Trucks Hit Disabled Vehicles on the Side of the Road, Victims Have Rights</b></p><p>Under the common law, or judge-made law, all motorists owe a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances in the use and operation of their vehicles.  This includes avoiding causing foreseeable harm to others on or near the roadway.  This means to avoid causing collisions such as crashes with other vehicles on or near the roadway.  This includes disabled vehicles on the side of the road.</p><p>When a large commercial truck collides wth a disabled vehicle on the side of the road, the truck driver and the trucking company is breaching the duty owed to all people.  If this breach results in serious personal injuries to the occupants of the disabled vehicle, the <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">truck driver may be liable for the collision under common law negligence</a>.</p><p>This is important because it allows a legal cause of action for victims to seek compensation for the following:</p><ul><li>Past pain and suffering;</li><li>Future pain and suffering;</li><li>Medical bills;</li><li>Medical expenses;</li><li>Future medical expenses such as future surgeries;</li><li>Lost wages;</li><li>Lost earnings when unable to perform the same work;</li><li>Loss of services;</li><li>Loss of consortium;</li><li>Need for around the clock care; and</li><li>Many other damages.</li></ul><p><b>When Large Commercial Trucks Hit Disabled Vehicles, Victims Have Rights to Compensation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Truck Driver Killed on I-40 When Tire Blew Out and Caused Fiery Wreck: What are the Deceased Driver’s Rights?</b></p><p>All commercial trucks are dangerous.  Even single vehicle crashes can be fatal.  <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-mexico/articles/2017-08-31/trucker-killed-in-fiery-crash-after-tire-blowout-on-i-40">News agencies are reporting a single-vehicle truck crash on August 31, 2017</a> occurring in New Mexico on Interstate 40.  The sole vehicle involved was a large commercial truck.  The truck driver’s tire blew out and the truck was caused to cross the center median and struck rocks.  The collision was so forceful that it resulted in a large fire which claimed the life of the truck driver.  There were no other fatalities or injuries.  It is unclear who the trucking company was and the identity of the driver at this time.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we represent victims of all types of <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking wrecks and 18 wheeler crashes</a>.  We have represented truckers from around the country injured on New Mexico’s roads, particularly the interstates like I-40, I-25, and I-10.  Many of our trucking clients come from out-of-state who are just using the interstates to deliver cargo coast-to-coast, including in Upland, California, Ontario, CA, Rancho Cucamonga, CA, and San Bernardino, California.  If you or a loved one were injured or killed in a trucking accident occurring in New Mexico, as a truck driver in or out-of-state, or as a passenger in another vehicle, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can fight to protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Rights of Truck Drivers in Single-Vehicle Crashes: Holding the Trucking Company Responsible</b></p><p>The news report shared above is a very sad case but an all-to-common case.  It may appear in these types of cases that victims of single vehicle crashes do not have anyone to blame but themselves.  However, that is not true.  And it is particularly not true under these facts where the tire blew out.</p><p>This is because the law of negligence (that applies in a vehicle crash) requires a showing that the breach of a duty was the proximate cause of the damages.  Here, the duty that was breached was not that by the truck driver to drive safely.  It was actually the duty of the trucking company to provide reasonably safe, proper, and well-maintained equipment such as commercial trucks.  This would include the tires on the trucks.</p><p>It was this breached duty that caused the subject crash, not the duty to drive safely.  That is, the truck driver’s operation of the vehicle was not what proximately caused the crash; the truck driver did not steer into the rocks.  It was the trucking company’s maintenance of the truck that caused the crash, i.e., the tire blowing out causing the truck to go into the rocks.  This accident was not caused by the truck driver.</p><p>Thus, a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/albuquerque-trucking-accident-attorney-explains-trucking-company-liability-in-trucking-accidents/">truck driver injured or killed in a single car crash can recover compensation from the trucking company</a> which negligently gave him or her a faulty, improperly maintained, or broken vehicle—this includes the tires.</p><p>While some defense attorneys may argue that the truck driver is just an agent of the trucking company, thus he was responsible for the maintenance of the tires in the truck he was driving, this misses the point.  The truck driver is indeed an agent of the trucking company, and any acts that he makes or takes is for the betterment of his or her employer—the trucking company.  Said differently, but for the trucking company the truck driver would not be doing what he was doing that caused the <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking crash</a>.</p><p><b>Victims from Upland, Ontario, or Anywhere in California or New Mexico Should Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. to Learn Their Rights When Truck Drivers Are Hurt or Killed in 18 Wheeler Wrecks</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Wrecks Caused by Large Commercial Trucks That Fail to Stop</b></p><p>Green means go, and red means stop—simple right?  Unfortunately that is not always true.  Far too many motor vehicle crashes occur each year where a defendant fails to stop at a red light, stop sign, yield, or other traffic control device or sign.  When one vehicle has the green to go and the other vehicle runs through the red to stop, the results can be catastrophic.  This is magnified when that vehicle that failed to stop is a large commercial truck such as an 18 wheeler, tanker, tandem trailer, tractor trailer, double trailer, bus, flatbed, or other large truck.</p><p><a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Victims of New Mexico trucking crashes</a> where the defendant failed to stop at a stop sign, red light, or other traffic control device may be entitled to compensation for his or her injuries.  This includes medical bills, property damage, pain and suffering, lost wages, lost earnings, and other expenses.  The <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque trucking crash lawyers at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, know how to handle these types of serious accidents and get victims the maximum compensation they may be entitled to.</p><p><b>When Large Commercial Trucks Fail to Stop: Common Instances to Guard Against</b></p><p>The most obvious time when a truck fails to stop and it causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious personal injury accident is at a red light</a>.  Most people think of this type of crash when they think of a motor vehicle crash.  That is, a crash at an intersection when one car runs a red light.  But when this happens with a large commercial truck, the other vehicle is likely completely destroyed into a heap of twisted metal.  Occupants of that smaller, passenger vehicle are often very seriously injured or killed.</p><p>Another obvious time is when a large commercial truck runs a stop sign.  Like a red light, this is a common scenario which also results in horrific injuries and catastrophic impacts which likely kill the occupants of the smaller, passenger vehicle.</p><p>Failing to yield is another instance when large commercial trucks fail to stop and causes serious <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking crashes</a>.  Common places where large commercial trucks fail to yield include at posted yield signs, but also on roundabouts, merging onto the highway or interstate, or at four-way stops.  When a large commercial truck does not have the right of way and causes the crash, it can result in serious personal injuries and even death.</p><p><b>Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. if a Large Commercial Truck Fails to Stop and Collides with You or a Loved One</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico 18 Wheeler Crashes Causing the Wrongful Death of a Child: Know Your Rights</b></p><p>There is nothing more tragic than the loss of a child.  This is especially true when the child is lost in a sudden and negligent accident.  One common type of negligent accident likely to cause the death of a child is an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">18 wheeler crash</a>.  This is because 18 wheelers, like all large commercial vehicles, are very heavy, fast, and powerful.  When this massive machine comes into contact with a small, defenseless body, a child will be seriously and mortally injured.  This is one very difficult type of wrongful death case due to the circumstances.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know that families will be absolutely devastated if their child is killed in a New Mexico 18 wheeler crash.  Our trucking accident attorneys have the experience, knowledge, and compassion to help navigate a family to the road of recovery.  While nothing will bring back a loved one, we can work to help protect the rights of the innocent child wrongfully killed due to the negligent of a truck driver or trucking company.  To learn more, call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Establishing Fault When a Child is a Passenger in a New Mexico 18 Wheeler Crash</b></p><p>When a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">child is wrongfully killed in a motor vehicle accident</a>, the child will be a passenger in a vehicle and not a driver.  Therefore there is no comparative fault of the child as a driver in causing the accident.  This means that the fault with lay 100% with the truck driver or the driver of the vehicle occupied by the child.  Unfortunately, this means that a parent may be comparatively at fault for the crash.</p><p>To establish fault in a negligence case, there must be a duty, that duty is breached, and that breach proximately causes damage.  All motorists have a duty of care to operate a motor vehicle with reasonable care under the circumstances which includes avoiding unnecessary crashes, following the rules of the road, and driving as a reasonable person would under the circumstances.  If a driver fails to do that, he or she will have breached the duty of care.  If that duty of care results in a crash which causes personal injuries, that driver will be liable for those injuries.</p><p>Thus, if a truck driver causes an 18 wheeler wreck, he or she will likely be negligent.  If another driver contributed to the crash, he or she may be apportioned with some fault for the crash.</p><p><b>Who Can Commence a Wrongful Death Claim for a Child</b></p><p>When a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">child is killed in a New Mexico 18 wheeler crash</a>, the child’s estate may commence an action to recover for damages.  Generally, the surviving parents will be first eligible to commence the action as a personal representative of the estate of the child.  Other individuals who may commence an action are legal guardians, siblings (who are not minors), grandparents, aunts/uncles, and some other individuals.</p><p>However, if a parent is the driver of the vehicle the child occupied, that parent may not commence the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death action</a> in most instances because that parent may be comparatively at fault for the crash—even if just 1% at fault.  Thus, the personal representative who commences the wrongful death action for the child must be a fault-free party.</p><p><b>Was Your Child Killed in a New Mexico 18 Wheeler Crash?  Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. to Learn More Today</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Understanding New Mexico Trucking Crashes: Evaluating Interstate 40</b></p><p>Interstate 40 is one of New Mexico’s busiest highway and intestates.  In fact, it is one of the United States’ busiest interstates as well.  It is the third longest interstate in the United States which runs through some of the largest cities in the country, including Memphis, TN, Raleigh, NC, Oklahoma City, OK, and our own Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p>In New Mexico, I-40 is approximately 374 miles long and has the highest speed limit of 75 MPH.  Of all of New Mexico’s interstates, however, I-40 is the most deadly.  It is nationally ranked as the 54th most dangerous stretch of interstate in the country (only the portion through New Mexico).  In a <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/deadliest-highways-ranking-the-100-interstates-most-likely-to-cause-a-fatal-crash">study of the accident numbers</a> from 2004-2008, there were 247 fatal accidents resulting in 293 fatalities.  This equates to .66 fatalities per mile, which was the measure used in the study.  <a href="https://www.geotab.com/the-most-dangerous-highways-in-america/">A more recent study</a> found Interstate 40 to be the sixth most dangerous stretch with 344 crashes resulting in 395 fatalities.  That is more than one fatalities a day on I-40.</p><p><b>Reasons Why Interstate Crashes Are So Dangerous: Large Commercial Trucks, Speed, and Weight</b></p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Interstate crashes are so dangerous</a> because they are vital to the logistics and trucking business.  Many large trucking companies such as Estes, UPS, FedEx, Schneider National, McLane, J.B. Hunt, and many others use these routes to ship cargo across the county.  I-40 goes directly across the country from North Carolina through California.  Thus the largest reason why I-40 is so dangerous is there are so many large commercial vehicles on the road.  Even a small and low-speed bumper tap from a large commercial truck could result in a catastrophic injury to a victim.</p><p>But on I-40, it is very rare for there to be a low-speed collision.  This stretch of I-40 in New Mexico is the fastest stretch of I-40 in the country at 75 MPH.  This is why collisions are so deadly on I-40 because the speed at which the vehicles are traveling is so high.  When large commercial trucks are involved, the speed combined with the weight creates a lot of momentum which must be dispersed into whatever it hits.  If that is a passenger vehicle, the <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">victims will be seriously injured or killed in the trucking crash</a>.</p><p>Therefore, the greatest factors causing I-40 crashes and making them fatal are the significant number of large commercial trucks, the high speed at which they travel, and the weight of those large trucks.</p><p><b>Common Injuries in I-40 Trucking Crashes</b></p><p>One of the most common injury—and certainly the most severe—in a New Mexico I-40 trucking crash is wrongful death.  It is a sad but true that many people are killed every year in New Mexico on I-40.  This is the ultimate personal injury which will effect an entire family.</p><p>Other common injuries caused by <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">I-40 trucking crashes in New Mexico</a> include the following:</p><ul><li>Amputation;</li><li>Paralysis;</li><li>Spinal cord injuries;</li><li>Traumatic brain injuries;</li><li>Nerve injuries;</li><li>Broken bones;</li><li>Orbital blowout fractures;</li><li>Need for shoulder replacement or hip replacement;</li><li>Significant lacerations;</li><li>Burns caused by fire or by chemicals being transported;</li><li>Loss of eyesight;</li><li>Organ damage; and</li><li>Many other types of injuries.</li></ul><p><b>I-40 Trucking Crashes in New Mexico are Deadly: The Above Statistics Prove You Need to Call a New Mexico Trucking Crash Lawyer</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Underride Trucking Crashes are Typically Fatal: Know When the Trucking Company is At Fault</b></p><p>Underride trucking crashes are horrific types of large commercial trucking crashes which are often fatal.  This is when a standard-sized vehicle strikes a large commercial vehicle and slides underneath the truck.  These are typically fatal because the bottom of the truck is at head and top-of-chest level which result in mortal injuries.  Airbags, safety curtains, and seatbelts do not help safe victims of true underside crashes.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we have handled many deadly underride trucking crashes in New Mexico.  Our experienced trucking accident lawyers know that these accidents are devastating for a family and their loved ones.  Victims can be killed in an instance due to the negligence of a trucking company, truck driver, or a combination of both.  If you or a loved one were seriously injured or killed in an underride trucking crash, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Causes of New Mexico Underride Trucking Crashes</b></p><p><a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Underride trucking crashes</a> can be difficult cases for several reasons.  The most common reason is because the smaller vehicle crashing from the behind usually rear-ends the truck.  This means that the passenger driver could be liable for his or her accident.  But there are some common reasons that underside trucking crashes are fatal because of the truck driver’s negligence.</p><p>Some examples of underride trucking crashes caused by the trucking company or truck driver’s negligence include the following:</p><ul><li>Slamming on the brakes at the last second;</li><li>Broken brake lights to warn drivers;</li><li>No rear lights on;</li><li>Reckless driving;</li><li>Driving while fatigued and falling asleep at the wheel;</li><li>Driving through a dust storm when he or she is supposed to stop;</li><li>Failing to use flashers when disabled;</li><li>Drunk driving or drugged driving;</li><li>Significant shift in cargo;</li><li>Tire blowouts;</li><li>Brake malfunction;</li><li>Distracted driving; and</li><li>Many other causes.</li></ul><p><b>Common Injuries Caused by New Mexico Underride Trucking Crashes</b></p><p>Underride trucking crashes are some of the worst trucking crashes to witness or be involved in.  When another vehicle traveling at a high speed, especially on the interstates like I-40, I-25, or I-10, collides and slides under large commercial truck, the damage is devastating.  Roofs of cars can be completely sheered off.  Just imagine what damage can be done to a person.</p><p>Some common injuries caused by <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">underride trucking crashes</a> include the following:</p><ul><li>Decapitation;</li><li>Broken bones;</li><li>Orbital blowout fractures;</li><li>Organ injuries;</li><li>Extreme lacerations or bruising;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Spinal cord injuries</a>;</li><li>Paralysis;</li><li>Crushing injuries;</li><li>Amputation of limbs;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries</a>;</li><li>Severe nerve damage;</li><li>Wrongful death; and</li><li>Many other injuries.</li></ul><p><b>Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. if You Have Been Injured in a New Mexico Underride Trucking Crash</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Top Three Worst Injuries Caused by a New Mexico Trucking Crash Ranked by Albuquerque Trucking Lawyer</b></p><p>Trucking crashes are simps devastating.  Large commercial trucks like 18 wheelers and big rigs can twist, bend, split, and pulverize other cars in <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking crashes</a>.  Even a passenger vehicle’s engine block can be crushed into a small cube.  Imagine the catastrophic blow that a large truck can do to the soft flesh of a human.  Even small bumper taps are damaging, whereas interstate trucking crashes are nearly always result in fatal or serious injuries.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque trucking crash attorneys</a> know the damage first hand by representing victims of catastrophic trucking crashes throughout New Mexico, including Las Cruces, Roswell, Rio Rancho, Santa Fe, and anywhere else.  If you or a loved one have been injured in any motor vehicle accident, especially a trucking crash, call us today for a free case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  Below our the top three worst injuries we routinely handle in New Mexico trucking crashes.</p><p><b>1. Worst Injury in New Mexico Trucking Crashes: Wrongful Death</b></p><p>The ultimate injury in a personal injury action is death.  There is nothing that can be fixed, reversed, or brought back after a patient has died.  Trucking crashes can result in horrific deaths such as those from serious and high speed impacts, crushing accidents, large fires, chemical burns, and other types.  While a lot of the times the victim may die on the side of the road, other times the victim may survive several hours, days, weeks, or even months in extreme pain and discomfort from the accident.  If this occurs, the medical bills will be high, the pain and suffering will be high, and the emotional distress on the victim and his or family will be unfathomable.</p><p><b>2. Second Worst Injury in New Mexico Trucking Crashes: Paralysis</b></p><p>Being unable to move or function is another horrible injury.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Quadriplegia and paraplegia</a> not only force a lifestyle changes on a victim, but also change careers—if any can be salvaged, family dynamics, and medical expenses.  Paralyzed victims may be unable to move their extremities but also feel extreme and intolerable pain in their injured limb.  Victims could depend on other people to completely care for them, including basic thinks like eating, drinking, bathing, and getting dressed.  Severely paralyzed people could even become depressed of their new life.</p><p><b>3. Third Worst Injury in New Mexico Trucking Crashes: Traumatic Brain Injuries </b></p><p>Even though the brain is encased in a shell of hard bone, it is very susceptible to serious injury in any motor vehicle crash.  This is because the brain can be injured even if the head is not struck when the head is whipped hard back and forth (whiplash).  But more commonly the brain is seriously injured when it is smashed into something during a trucking crash.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries</a> can be completely debilitating where a patient will need around the clock assistance from caretakers, or traumatic brain injuries can be debilitating and cause functional issues like memory, concentration, or cause headaches that impede a person’s daily activities.  In either situation, traumatic brain injuries can completely destroy a person’s life and disrupt a family completely.</p><p><b>Any of the Top Three Injuries Need the Representation of the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. for Zealous Representation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

BODY:
<p><b>When Blind Spots Cause Albuquerque Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Commercial trucks like 18 wheelers, tankers, tractor trailers, double trailers, tandem trailers, flatbeds, big rigs, and other large trucks have more and larger blind spots than passenger vehicles.  These blind spots are at spots on the truck where passenger vehicles are likely to lurk, including just behind the truck and to the immediate sides near the truck cabin.  Because of this, it is very likely that improper maneuvers such as lane changes or merges by the truck driver can result in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">very serious collisions</a> with passenger vehicles.</p><p>Victims of <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking accidents</a> caused by truck drivers failing to see what there is to be seen in his or her blind spot can be very serious injured or killed.  Here at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.,</a> our experienced <a href="/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking accident lawyers</a> handle cases where victims have sustained catastrophic or fatal injuries from negligent motorists, including truck drivers.  We have fought some of the largest trucking companies in the United Stats, including J.B. Hunt, FedEx, Schneider, and  many others.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed, call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Failing to See What There is to be Seen</b></p><p>All motorists on the roadway must seen what there is to be seen. This is part of a motorist’s obligation to use reasonable care in the use and operation of his or her motor vehicle.  When a truck driver fails to see what there is to be seen and fail to use reasonable care, it can result in a trucking crash.  These types of trucking crashes are negligent and victims or their families are entitled to compensation for their injuries.</p><p><b>Crashes Caused When Changing Lanes Results in Liability</b></p><p>The general rule is whoever is in a lane first will have the right to the lane.  A motorist coming into that lane and causing a crash will be found to make an improper lane change and may be liable for the crash.  This is both under the common law, or judge-made law, as well as the statutory law made by the Legislature.</p><p>For instance, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-317/">NM Stat.66-7-317</a> provides that “a vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practical entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety[.]”  When a truck driver does not see another vehicle in a blind spot and changes lanes causing a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking crash</a>, that truck driver will have violated this statute.  In violating this statute, the truck driver will be liable for all injuries proximately caused to victims under the doctrine of negligence per se.</p><p>This doctrine provides that the violation of a statute which causes harm to a protected class will render the violator automatically liable.  It is a great tool for victims of personal injury accidents to use to protect their rights.</p><p><b>Victims of Albuquerque Trucking Crashes Caused by Blind Spots May Be Entitled to Compensation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Fatal RV Crash on I-40 Involving Three Vehicles Including an RV Caused by a Tire Blowout</b></p><p>Like <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">large commercial trucks</a>, recreational vehicles or RVs are very large, heavy, and generate significant moment.  This is particularly true on interstates like I-40, I-25, and I-10.  <a href="http://www.kob.com/new-mexico-news/four-killed-multi-vehicle-crash-santa-rosa-new-mexico-state-police-nmsp/4576500/">Police are reporting that four people were killed in a multi-vehicle accident</a> about eight miles west of Santa Rosa, New Mexico, including an RV on I-40.  According to New Mexico State Police, the RV was eastbound and had a tire blow out.  This caused the RB to cross the median and hit oncoming cars in the westbound lanes.  The four people that were killed were all in one vehicle that was hit by the RV.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we have seen this scenario happen many times before.  Unfortunately these wrongful deaths likely could have been prevented.  If you or a loved one have been <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">seriously injured or killed in a New Mexico vehicle crash</a>, including a large vehicle like a recreational vehicle (RV), call our experienced New Mexico car accident lawyers by dialing (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation to learn how we can help you obtain the maximum compensation you may be entitled to.</p><p><b>RV Tire Blowouts Are Likely Negligence</b></p><p>Tire blowouts are a more common problem for <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">large vehicles like 18 wheelers</a> or RVs.  This is because of the weight on the tires and the force placed on them.  When the tires begin to fail, the added weight creates a very dangerous situation were even small wear and tear or damage could have massive consequences.  It is very likely in the horrific news story above that the tire that had the blowout was already showing signs of damage or wear and tear.  Because of this, hitting a pothole or other bump in the road will result in a tire blowout as opposed to just a hard bump.</p><p>When a tire blowout occurs because of the failure to inspect the RV, the RV driver could be liable for causing any injuries to other motorists.  For instance, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-3/part-10/section-66-3-901/">NM Stat. 66-3-901 </a>provides that “[n]o person shall driver or move on any highway any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer or pole trailer or any combination thereof unless the equipment upon every vehicle is in good working order . . . and the vehicle is in such safe mechanical condition as not to endanger the driver or other occupant or any person upon the highway.”</p><p>Since a tire blowout does not occur to a healthy, strong tire, it is likely that the tire was wither worn and weak being the fault of the RV driver.  Or that the tire had a manufacturing defect.  Even if the RV hit a pothole, tires are designed to withstand collisions such as that.</p><p>Therefore it is likely that the RV driver and/or owner violated NM Stat. 66-3-901 and could be liable for the injuries and <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful deaths caused by the crash.</a></p><p><b>RV Crashes that Cause Wrongful Deaths Due to Tire Blowouts Can Result in Liability</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque, New Mexico Trucking Crashes Resulting in Amputations and Lost Limbs are Very Serious Cases</b></p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/data-and-statistics/large-truck-and-bus-crash-facts">Large Truck and Bus Crash Facts annual report</a> from the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)</a>, there were over <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/data-and-statistics/large-truck-and-bus-crash-facts-2015">4,000 fatal large truck crashes</a> which is an 8% increase from the last year.  There were also approximately 87,000 truck crashes resulting in serious injuries.  It is obvious that, when 18 wheelers, big rigs, double trailers, semis, and other large trucks collide with other vehicles there is the potential for very serious injury.  One of the most debilitating and painful injury is when catastrophic damage to a limb requires amputation of the victim’s arm, leg, hand, or foot.</p><p>Lost limbs are unfortunately a common injury in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking crashes</a>, especially along the major interstates such as I-40, I-10, and I-25 which go through major trucking hubs like Las Cruces and Albuquerque.  Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque trucking crash lawyers</a> know how to help victims and families recover the money they need to compensate them for pain and suffering, lost wages, medical bills, future medical bills and procedures, and other costs.  To learn more how we can help you and your family, call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Types of Trucking Crashes Causing Amputations and Lost Limbs</b></p><p>Losing a limb is a traumatic event.  Especially when it is caused by the negligence of another person.  <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">Trucking crashes</a> are very likely to result in such injuries due to the negligence of a truck driver.  This is particularly because of the sheer size, weight, and speed of these large commercial trucks which make even minor bumper taps potentially fatal.  This means large trucks can crush and damage smaller passenger vehicles at even low speeds.  This makes people very susceptible to injuries, particularly to their limbs.</p><p>Some common types of trucking crashes resulting in amputations and lost limbs include the following:</p><ul><li>Rear end collisions;</li><li>T-bone crashes;</li><li>High speed accidents;</li><li>Side-swipe collisions;</li><li>Crashes from improper lane changes;</li><li>Jackknife or truck rollovers;</li><li>Head on collisions; and</li><li>Many other crashes.</li></ul><p><b>Reasons Lost Limb Trucking Crashes Are So Significant</b></p><p>In personal injury accidents, usually the largest factor determining the compensation is the pain and suffering.  The next largest factor is usually lost wages.  Generally after that medical bills or medical costs would come next.  In any <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking accident cases</a>, especially in lost limb cases, all three of these figures can be incredibly high.</p><p>It goes without saying that the pain and suffering for a lost limb can be horrific.  Usually in trucking crashes which result in an amputation the limb is crushed, shredded, and torn to pieces before it is amputated.  Many times limbs can even be trapped in the twisted steel of a trucking wreck.  It is very obvious that the pain is excruciating.</p><p>The lost wages will also be staggering.  The amount of time off from work following an amputation will be significant and horrifying.  It may take months if not years to be ready to participate again in the work force after an amputation—especially a very serious amputation like an arm or a leg.  Many people who lose a limb are not able to go back to their pre-accident job.  Losing an arm is very debilitating to almost any office job, while losing a leg can be career-ending for any type of laborer.</p><p>Finally, the medical costs will be staggering.  This is obvious in that the costs of any treatment after a trucking crash will be significant.  The additional procedures, surgeries, and treatment in performing the amputation and aftercare is also significant.  The risk of infection is also large, and antibiotic regimens are needed to prevent serious and fatal infections or sepsis.</p><p><b>Lost Limbs Due to Albuquerque Trucking Crashes are Very Serious</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Tire Blowouts from 18 Wheelers Can Caused Fatal New Mexico Trucking Crashes</b></p><p>Large commercial trucks are significantly more dangerous than other vehicles on the roadway and especially on interstates and highways.  This is not just because of their large size, heavy cargo, and speed—which all generate significant momentum—but also because of their wheels.  Yes, an 18 wheeler’s most dangerous attributes is just that—it’s 18 wheels.  These can crush vehicles pulled underneath the vehicle and can even explode like grenades if not maintained properly.</p><p>In fact, <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">tire blowouts from 18 wheelers</a> can launch dangerous shrapnel into the air at very high speeds which can tear right through smaller passenger vehicles.  Large chunks could act as unguided missiles, whereas the debris and shrapnel launched could function like an explosive next to other vehicles.</p><p>The sad thing is that the vast majority of tire blowouts can be completely avoided with proper maintenance and care.  This means that trucking companies and truck drivers must properly inspect and repair their vehicles before they send them on the roadways.  When they fail to do that, it can be the result of negligence.  If your or a loved one has been injured or killed in a New Mexico 18 wheeler crash caused by a tire blowout, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 today.</p><p><b>Drivers of 18 Wheelers Must Inspect Their Trucks</b></p><p>Some large commercial trucks like big rigs, 18 wheelers, tankers, tractor trailers, semis, random trailers, and other large trucks can weigh more than 80,000 pounds.  If a driver ignores torn treads, damages tires, or defective tires it can have <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">massive and deadly consequences</a>.  This is why the federal regulations place certain requirements on an 18 wheeler’s tires.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.393%23se49.5.393_175">49 CFR s 393.75</a> provides under sub(a) that “[n]o motor vehicle shall be operated on any tire that—</p><ol><li>Has body ply or belt material exposed through the tread or sidewall,</li><li>Has any tread or sidewall separation,</li><li>Is flat or has an audible leak, or</li><li>Has a cut to the extent that the ply or belt material is exposed.”</li></ol><p>Further, pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.392%23se49.5.392_17">49 CFR 392.7(a)</a>, “[n]o commercial motor vehicle shall be driver unless the driver is satisfied that following parts and accessories are in good working order . . . tires.”  Under subdivision (b), the truck drivers must also check the “wheels, rims, lugs, tires” because they go onto the road.</p><p>Thus, when a truck driver falls to do that and there is a tire blowout, it can result in serious personal injury and be caused by the negligence of a truck driver.</p><p><b>Proving Improper Tire Maintenance in 18 Wheeler Truck Crashes</b></p><p>From the fact that an 18 wheeler tire explodes, that is usually sufficient enough proof of negligence in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking crash</a>.  However, some external factors could cause a tire blowout.  Thus you will need to prove liability that the tire tread was obviously defective or dangerous and could have and should have been discovered in a reasonable inspection.  This includes looking for evidence of the following:</p><ul><li>Wear damage to the tire shards and leftover pieces that occur over time;</li><li>Driver’s and truck’s logbook to see when the tires were last replaced;</li><li>Evidence that the tread was separating and pulling away as opposed to being sliced or damaged;</li><li>Evidence of the tire being overinflated or under inflated;</li><li>The logbook of when the truck was last inspected, including when the tires were checked; and</li><li>Many other pieces of evidence.</li></ul><p><b>Tire Blowouts Caused by New Mexico Trucking Crashes Can Cause Wrongful Deaths</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Special Rules Apply When New Mexico State Big Trucks Cause Accidents Which All Victims Need to Know</b></p><p>There are more and more large commercial trucks on the roads, especially on New Mexico’s busy interstates such as I-10, I-40, and I-25.  This means there are more possibilities for serious Albuquerque trucking crashes to occur which can seriously injure or kill an individual.  While many of these trucking crashes are caused by some of the country’s largest trucking companies like Schneider, J.B. Hunt, and FedEx, some of these trucking crashes are caused by New Mexico State vehicles.  This is particularly true of New Mexico State Department of Transportation trucks, which can be very large heavy, and bulky vehicles that could cause <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">catastrophic trucking accidents</a>.</p><p>But unlike other large commercial trucks, motor vehicle crashes involving New Mexico State trucks have special rules that victims must follow or their claim will forever be barred.  Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know how these rules work and ensure they are complied with so that a victim’s right to compensation is not violated.  Call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque trucking crash attorneys</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help you and your family recovery after a serious trucking crash anywhere in New Mexico.</p><p><b>Trucking Crashes Involving New Mexico State Vehicles: Know How Long You Have to File a Claim</b></p><p>Generally, under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-37/article-1/section-37-1-8/">New Mexico law</a> the victim of a negligence case such as a motor vehicle accident has three years from the date of the accident to commence a lawsuit.  This is known as the statute of limitations period.  Failing to commence an action within the statute of limitations period is grounds for dismissing the case and preventing the victim from recovering any compensation.</p><p>However, in a trucking crash involving a New Mexico State vehicle such as a Department of Transportation truck the rules are different.  There, there must be a <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter41/article4/section41-4-16/">notice of claim victim within 90 days of the accident</a>.  This is an important and very rigid requirement which tells the State that there was an incident which resulted in a claim caused by the conduct of a State worker or the State.  This is abbreviated because the purpose is to allow a thorough investigation before memories fade and evidence disappears since most State employers perform a lot of tasks in a short period of time.  This is also to create an expedited settlement process wherein the State, after investigating the claim, could offer to settle before proceeding to litigation.</p><p>Once the notice of claim process plays out, if the State does not settle there must be a lawsuit.  However, this is also not the normal rules for a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking crash</a>.  Unlike the normal rule that a lawsuit for a trucking crash must be commenced within 3 years, when the State is the defendant it is actually only 2 years.  This is under the <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter41/article4/section41-4-15/">New Mexico Tort Claims Act</a> which makes it harder for a victim to sue the government.  If a victim does not know this, or if a lawyer representing the victim is not careful, it can result in the dismissal of the case even if it is a perfect, slam-dunk case.</p><p><b>Hire an Experienced Albuquerque Trucking Crash Attorney Against the State of New Mexico in DOT Crashes</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Passengers Have Different Rights and Liability Than Drivers in New Mexico Motor Vehicle Crashes: New Mexico Personal Injury Attorney Explains</b></p><p>Any type of motor vehicle crash can result in multiple victims being injured or killed by negligent acts or omissions of a driver.  However, all drivers could have come fault in the accident—even if one was not the actual or direct cause of the accident.  Whereas passengers very likely have any fault in causing the accident because they were not operating a vehicle.  This is why passengers and drivers have different rights and liability in New Mexico motor vehicle crashes.</p><p>Therefore, it is important that passengers who are victims of motor vehicle crashes call an experienced New Mexico personal injury attorney to represent their rights.  They do not have the same rights or liabilities as a driver, and passengers may be entitled to more money than a driver.  Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we have represented passengers who were victims of some horrific motor vehicle crashes in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Roswell, and almost throughout the entire state.  If you or a loved one was injured or killed as a passenger in a motor vehicle crash, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico motor vehicle crash attorneys</a> to learn more how we can help protect your rights to compensation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Establishing Fault in New Mexico Motor Vehicle Crashes</b></p><p>There are many different possible causes of all <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle crashes</a>.  In fact, most times motor vehicle crashes are inappropriate for accelerated judgment, known as a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, simply because there could be so many different things a reasonable person could have done to avoid the accident.  This means that there is a question of fact for a reasonable person, i.e. the jury, to resolve.</p><p>However, passengers very rarely have any comparative fault in a motor vehicle accident.  Unless a passenger is distracting the driver, grabs the wheel, or blocks the driver’s view, it is very unlikely for a passenger to have caused a motor vehicle crash.</p><p>This means that a passenger cannot be found partially at fault for the crash.  Said differently, this means that a passenger is entitled to recovery the full amount of his or her injuries because he or she will be said to not have contributed to the crash.  This means that victims who are passenger are usually in a better position to recover compensation from the other parties.</p><p><b>Passengers Who are Children Have Special Rules</b></p><p>Where a passenger in a vehicle involved in a motor vehicle crash is a minor, that child has slightly different rules regarding the lawsuit when the parent was the driver of the car the child was in.  This is because, unfortunately and technically, the child may have a claim against the parent for negligent driving or comparative fault.</p><p>For example, if the defendant is 90% at fault for the car crash but the parent admitted to not paying attention and could have braked or mitigated the accident by taking some last-second evasive maneuver, the parent could be liable for 10% of the crash.  This means the passenger-child can collect 90% of the judgment from the defendant and 10% from his parent.  That may not seem like a lot, but damages to children are often very high and above a million dollars.  That means 10% could be well-over a $100,000 in compensation.</p><p>Because of this, the same lawyer cannot usually represent the parent-driver and the child-passenger.  This is to avoid a conflict of interests.  It is important for victims to know about this, because it could result in a big problem during the lawsuit or at the time of trial.  It is also important to know about this because it could be a source of compensation for the child to <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">recover damages for the car crash</a> from, i.e., the parent’s insurance company.</p><p><b>Passengers Hurt in New Mexico Motor Vehicle Crashes Need to Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Texting While Driving is Very Dangerous, Especially When the Driver is a Truck Driver: New Mexico Trucking Crashes and Wrongful Deaths</b></p><p>Cell phone use is pervasive while driving.  People have been talking on the phone while driving for over a decade, and many motor vehicle manufacturers are even creating bluetooth systems to people can continue to talk while driving.  This does make it slightly safer as it allows both hands to be back on the wheel.</p><p>Which is why texting while driving is so dangerous, as even with the advent of bluetooth systems it is still very hard if not impossible to text while driving with both hands on the wheel.  Because of this, texting while driving is quickly becoming just as dangerous as drunk driving and drugged driving—if not more dangerous.  Many motor vehicle crashes are being caused when drivers divert their attention, eyes, and hand off the wheel to text.</p><p>This is particularly dangerous for large commercial truck drivers, like those who operate tandem trailers, big rigs, semis, flatbeds, tractor trailers, double trailers, 18-wheelers, tankers, and other large vehicles.  A truck driver texting while driving just becomes an unguided missile, especially on the interstates or highways of New Mexico.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed due to a commercial truck driver texting while driving, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking crash attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> to learn how to we protect your rights to compensation by dialing (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation.</p><p><b>Texting While Driving is Against the Law for All Drivers in New Mexico</b></p><p>Our Legislature in New Mexico has made it illegal for anyone and everyone, except in dire emergency circumstances, to text while driving.  This is provided for in <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">NM Stat. 66-7-374, subdivision (A)</a>, which provides that “[a] person shall not read or view a text message or manually type on a handheld mobile communication device for any purpose while driving a motor vehicle . . . .”</p><p>When any driver causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle crash in New Mexico</a> because he or she was driving while texting, that person will be violating this statute.  Victims of that motor vehicle crash can hold that defendant negligent per se, meaning that he or she will be liable for all harm caused by violating what the statute meant to the protect.</p><p>The prohibition on texting while driving was intended to protect all motorists on the road, therefore anyone texting while driving and causing an injury will be deemed negligent under these circumstances.  This applies to all commercial truck drivers as well.</p><p><b>Truck Drivers Have an Additional Rule Prohibiting Them From Texting While Driving</b></p><p>Even though NM Stat. 66-7-374 applies to all commercial truck drivers, that is New Mexico statutory law.  There are also federal regulations which apply to all truck drivers no matter what state they are driving in which also prohibit truck drivers from texting while driving.  The specific regulation is 49 CFR section 392.82, which provides that no driver of a commercial truck shall engage in texting while driving.  The regulation also prohibits any trucking company from requiring the truck driver to text while driving.</p><p>Unlike the New Mexico statute, a violation of this regulation which causes a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">personal injury in a trucking crash</a> is not automatically negligence but evidence of negligence.  This means that a truck driver is not automatically liable to a victim.  However, because our Legislature enacted NM Stat. 66-7-374 (something not all states have), victims of <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking crashes</a> have been further protected by our government and accidents like this are automatically deemed caused by the negligence of a truck driver.</p><p>Therefore, victims in New Mexico have stronger protections and rights, as long as they have an experienced trucking accident attorney that knows this.</p><p><b>The Caruso Law Offices, P.C. is a Trusted, Knowledgeable, and Experienced New Mexico Trucking Crash Law Firm that Victims Need to Call to Get the Maximum Amount of Compensation They Deserve</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

TITLE: Unqualified Drivers Causing New Mexico Trucking Accidents: Trucking Company Liability

BODY:
<p><b>When Trucking Companies Allow Unqualified Drivers to Operate Commercial Vehicles, the Trucking Companies are Liable for New Mexico Trucking Crashes</b></p><p>Driving a large commercial truck such as a big rig, 18-wheeler, semi, tanker, tandem trailer, tractor-trailer, flatbed, or any other large vehicle is not like driving a car.  Drivers must have additional experience and pass additional licensure requirements before they are legally allowed on the roads.  It is the responsibility of the truck driver to comply with these additional requirements and laws, but it is also always the requirement of the trucking company to ensure all of its drivers are qualified.</p><p>Unqualified drivers are simply more dangerous and likely to cause a serious New Mexico trucking crash.  With some of the largest and busiest trucking interstates in the United States, New Mexico’s I-40, I-25, and I-10 can already be very dangerous places.  Add inexperienced or unqualified driver and you have a recipe for <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">deadly trucking cases</a>.</p><p>Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> have handled many of these types of fatal trucking crashes and know that victims deserve to be protected.  One of the most basic things that a trucking company can do is to avoid placing unqualified drivers on the road.  Unfortunately, far too many trucking companies simply do not care and put people on or around the roads at risk.  If you or a loved one have been <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">seriously injured or killed in a commercial trucking crash</a> caused by an unqualified driver, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>What is a CDL and Why is it Required?</b></p><p>A <a href="http://www.dmv.org/commercial-drivers/cdl-class-types.php">CDL, or commercial driver’s license</a>, is simply a driver’s license required to operate large commercial vehicles or trucks.  Almost every truck driver needs one.  To apply for a CDL in New Mexico, a driver needs to have a regular driver’s license and then take a CDL course.  There is a general knowledge written test which must be passed.  A CDL application must also pass a hand’s on behind-the-wheel driver’s test which tests the physical ability of the driver.  There are numerous other background and test submissions required as well.</p><p>The purpose of a CDL is to ensure that the drivers of large commercial vehicles know what they are doing and are trained, able, and knowledgeable about operating these types of motor vehicles.  The goal is to reduce the number of trucking crashes and injuries or fatalities caused by these trucking crashes.</p><p><b>Liability for Unqualified Truck Drivers</b></p><p>There is an extensive federal matrix of regulations applicable to all truck drivers throughout the United States.  Under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.390%23se49.5.390_13">49 CFR 390.3 (a)</a>, the regulations apply to all employers, employees, and commercial vehicles transporting goods throughout multiple states.  Under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.391%23se49.5.391_111">49 CFR 391.11 (a)</a>, “[a] person shall not drive a commercial motor vehicle unless he/she is qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle” which includes having a CDL.  Therefore, the burden is on the truck driver to comply with the licensing laws.  Thus if he or she fails to do so and causes a serious New Mexico trucking crash, the victim of such crash can use this to help establish liability.</p><p>Under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.391%23se49.5.391_121">49 CFR 391.21</a>, the trucking company must review the truck drivers application and ensure he or she has the requirements.  Moreover and more directly, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.390%23se49.5.390_111">49 CFR  390.11</a> provides that, for the requirements of the regulations imposed on a driver or a prohibition on a driver, “it shall be the duty of the motor carrier to require observance of such duty or prohibition.

TITLE: Fatalities or Serious Injuries from Albuquerque Truck Crashes Require Alcohol and Drug Testing

<p><b>Trucking Companies Must Perform Alcohol or Drug Testing When There is a Fatal Crash or Serious Injuries from a Dangerous Albuquerque Trucking Accident</b></p><p>Trucking is big business in the United States.  Many of America’s big businesses are trucking companies or logistics companies.  They use the interstate system to send goods from coast to coast and north to south, including some of the busiest interstates in the country which are in New Mexico like I-40, I-10, and I-25.  The largest trucking companies use these interstates constantly and are United Parcel Service of America, Fed Ex, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, YRC Worldwide, Swift Transportation, HUB Group, and many more.</p><p>Because of this, there are extensive federal regulations which govern the conduct of large commercial vehicles throughout all states.  States are free to add more restrictions or laws, but the federal regulations will cover a large amount of the standard conduct.  Even though most trucking companies try to comply, unfortunately a lot of times they cut corners, make mistakes, and don’t exercise safety.  This results in very serious trucking crashes, including in New Mexico.</p><p><b>Drugs and Alcohol are Major Cause of Albuquerque Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>One of the most common causes of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking crashes in New Mexico</a> is due to drugs or alcohol.  It is a sad truth that a lot of truck drivers do drink immediately before or even during their shift.  Some do it habitually, others do it to deal with the stress of being away from family.  But either way, it is illegal and dangerous.</p><p>It is also well-known that truck drivers will also abuse drugs.  Most of the abused drugs are stimulants to keep them awake and give them energy to continue driving long periods of time without rest.  However, the drugs will also cause troubles with inhibitions and make it harder for motorists to react or judge distances.  This can easily result in serious personal injuries in a truck crash.</p><p><b>Trucking Companies Must Test Truck Drivers for Drugs or Alcohol in Certain Circumstances</b></p><p>Under the federal regulations, a trucking company must test a driver for drugs or alcohol after an accident in certain circumstances.  If the trucking company fails to do so, it will be a violation of the federal regulations and an injured victim could use that to demonstrate the trucking companies negligence, lack of protocol, and poor structure which caused the motor vehicle accident.  These regulations are under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.382%23se49.5.382_1303">49 CFR s 383.303</a>.</p><p>First, a trucking company must test a truck driver for drugs or alcohol if the driver gets a citation/ticket from law enforcement and there were either very serious personal injuries which need immediate medical treatment away from the scene (<i>i.e.</i>, requiring hospitalization) or if a disabled vehicle must be towed form the scene.</p><p>Second, a trucking company must test a truck driver for drugs or alcohol if there is a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/practice-areas/trucking-accident-overview/fatal-truck-accidents/">fatality from the trucking accident</a>.  This is an obvious one, but sometimes fatalities do not always occur right after the crash.  In fact, the federal rules state that a fatality is related to the crash if it occurs within 30 days.  Thus, a trucking company is best to always test a driver involved in a very serious crash which causes possibly fatal injuries.</p><p>The time to test for alcohol must be within 2 hours after the accident.  The time to test for drugs but be within 32 hours after the accident.  During this time, unless law enforcement says otherwise, a truck driver may actually continue to drive despite having a crash.  If a truck companies let the driver continue knowing he or she may be positive, that too can result in liability for the trucking company.</p><p><b>Injured in an Albuquerque Trucking Crash Caused by a Drunk or Drugged Truck Driver?  Not Sure if the Trucking Company Tested Him or Her, or Helped Protect You from Harm?  Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. to Learn How We Can Protect Your Rights!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Fatal Crashes Result in the Death of a Rider on a Scooter and Pedestrian</b></p><p>In Albuquerque, there are many different ways that a victim can be seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident.  For instance, Albuquerque is one of the largest trucking routes in New Mexico, if not one of the busiest in the United States.  Most large commercial trucking companies such as FedEx, Schneider, US Parcel, McLane, and other companies use Interstate 10, Interstate 25, and Interstate 40 to delivery cargo throughout the US.  <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking accidents</a> are very common and very deadly.</p><p>There is also a lot of commuter traffic of passenger cars in Albuquerque, particularly because are large residential neighborhoods near busy business areas.  This also means there are a lot of pedestrians or people on alternative vehicle such as bikes, scooters, mopeds, skateboards, and the like.</p><p>Unfortunately, this also means there are a lot of motor vehicle accidents.  <a href="http://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/-zuni-and-san-pedro-intersection-shut-down-due-to-fatal-accident/4547770/">Last week on Thursday, July 20, 2017</a>, there were two fatal accidents in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The first involved a motor vehicle and a rider on a scooter at the intersection of Zuni Road and San Pedro Drive SE.  The individual on the scooter was killed and pronounced dead at the scene.  Later in the day, a pedestrian was struck and killed by a car near 98th Street and Avalon Road.</p><p>Both cases are still in the beginning of the investigation phase.  However, here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque motor vehicle accident attorneys</a> know that these type of accidents are caused by negligence and completely avoidable.  If your or a loved one was seriously injured or killed in a motor vehicle crash similar to this in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Roswell, or anywhere else throughout New Mexico, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Intersections are Dangerous, Which is Why These Two Fatal Crashes Occurred</b></p><p>It is a common fact that intersections are a very dangerous if not the most dangerous part of a road.  Think about it—traffic in one direction is going to directly cross over traffic in another direction.  There can be a lot of signs, directions, arrows, and traffic control devices to distract drivers.  There are multiple other cars, trucks, other vehicles, and even pedestrians coming in and out of the roadway.  This is why there are a lot of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle crashes</a> at intersections.</p><p>In the two cases above, it is clear that the intersection’s confusion caused the death of two classes of people who are most likely to be overlooked—people on alternative vehicles like scooters, bikes, mopeds, skateboards, and to pedestrians on foot.  These wrongful deaths will result in liability for the negligent parties if the victims’ families retain aggressive legal representation.</p><p><b>Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. for Zealous Advocacy for your Personal Injuries or Family’s Wrongful Death Cases</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque, New Mexico Truck Crashes Caused by Driver Inexperience Results in Liability for Driver AND the Trucking Company</b></p><p>It goes without saying that large commercial trucks are very different than other motor vehicles on the road.  They are much more difficult to drive and require special training, skill, and even a special CDL license.  This license requires not just a paper test, but also ride-along hours before a physical road test.  Most trucking companies, particularly the largest companies like US Parcel, Schneider, FedEx, and other companies also require new drivers to do certain training and safety courses.  They sometimes even have to pass company-specific training courses or tests.</p><p>However, sometimes these are not enough to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  And the most dangerous truck drivers in New Mexico are the ones with the least amount of experience.  Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know that.  We have handled many cases where the truck driver was undertrained and never should have been on the road.  Yet trucking companies still allow these dangerous drivers to be on the road and cause serious injuries to other drivers.  If you or a loved one have been injured in a truck crash in Albuquerque or anywhere in New Mexico, call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Trucking Companies are Liable for Inexperienced Truck Drivers</b></p><p>Before a trucking company loads up a truck driver with large, heavy cargo and throws him or her onto the interstate such as I-40, I-10, or I-25, the truck driver must be well-trained.  Large commercial trucks like semis, big rigs, tandem trailers, tankers, flatbeds, and other large vehicles are incredibly dangerous.  Trucking companies need to ensure that their truck drivers are able to handle the huge responsibility of safely delivering cargo throughout the United States.</p><p>And when trucking companies do not, it can result in liability for the trucking company.  This is because trucking companies are <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">vicariously liable for the acts of their truck drivers such as trucking crashes</a>.  This is under an ancient legal doctrine which still survives today, known as a master-servant relationship called respondeat superior.  This doctrine means that a master or employer will be liable for the acts or omissions of a servant or employee.</p><p>Therefore, when a truck driver is negligent in causing a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accident in Albuquerque</a>, it will result in liability for the trucking company.  This is an important tool for personal injury victims to use to win their case.</p><p><b>Truck Drivers Who Cause Albuquerque Truck Crashes Will Make Their Trucking Companies Liable</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Drugged Driver Strikes and Kills Woman Walking on US 380 Outside Roswell, New Mexico</b></p><p><a href="http://www.ruidosonews.com/story/news/local/2017/07/12/pedestrian-killed-lincoln-traffic-accident/471989001/">New outlets are reporting</a> that a pedestrian who was walking along US Highway 380 in Lincoln, New Mexico was struck and killed by a drugged driver on July 12, 2017.  Beverly Bradburry Cline of Kilgore, Texas was walking in the shoulder of the highway when the vehicle driver by Margaret Cano-Sammis left the road and struck Cline causing fatal injuries.  First Responders pronounced Cline deceased at the scene.  The driver, Cano-Sammis, admitted to using medicinal marijuana and methadone earlier in the day and was arrested for alleged vehicular homicide.</p><p>Cline’s death could have been avoided.  But unfortunately it was not, and many other people across New Mexico are injured or killed on highways, interstates, and other roads throughout the state.  Here at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know that most motor vehicle crashes can be avoided.  Drugged driving accidents are on the rise and result in more fatal collisions than drunk driving.  If you or a loved one has been injured or killed, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced Roswell car accident attorneys</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p>This sad news story brings up many interesting legal issues to be discussed.  All parties are innocent until proven guilty, but this does not mean that there may not be liability to explain.</p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/pedestrian-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><b>Pedestrian Collisions in New Mexico</b></a></p><p>Whenever a motor vehicle strikes a pedestrian in New Mexico, it is very likely that the driver will be negligent as a matter of law.  This is because <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-337/">New Mexico Stat. 66-7-337</a> provides that “every driver of a vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian upon any roadway[.]”  This law is intended to protect pedestrians on or around the roadway from being struck by a motor vehicle.  When this occurs, it can result in serious <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Personal injuries</a> or death.  Victims can be permanently injured or killed in pedestrian knockdowns.</p><p>Therefore, under the doctrine of negligence per se the driver who strikes and injures a pedestrian will be found automatically negligent for violating this statute.  The driver may provide a rebuttable presumption that the pedestrian solely caused or contributed to the subject accident, but it is a difficult position to be in.</p><p>Also under the common law, or judge-made law, a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">pedestrian struck by a car</a> will have the common law definition of negligence on their side.  This provides that a motorist must use reasonable care under the circumstances and in the use and operation of his or her vehicle to avoid striking a pedestrian.  If that occurs, the defendant is likely negligent under the common law standard for negligence as well.</p><p><b>Drugged Driving is a Serious Problem</b></p><p>Cline was killed by a driver who admitted to taking controlled substances earlier in the day, including marijuana.  Many people are under the impression that marijuana is not as dangerous as other drugs, and is safe to drive under the influence of.  However, medicinal marijuana is used to help relax an anxious person and fight certain ailments.  It can calm a person and slow down their alertness and ability to react.  This can obviously be dangerous when traveling on a highway such as US 380, or even an interstate such as I-40, I-25, or I-10.</p><p>A drugged driver be also be negligent per se.  This is because <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter66/article8/section66-8-102">NM Stat. 66-8-102</a> provides that it is “illegal for a person who is under the influence of any drug to a degree that renders the person incapable of safety driving a vehicle to drive a vehicle in this state.”  Any drug in a driver’s system will result in liability.</p><p><b>Where to Commence an Action: New Mexico or Texas?</b></p><p>The victim was from Texas but killed due to the apparent negligence of a driver in New Mexico.  A common question is where should the victim’s family commence an action?  This is known as a conflict of law issue and a venue question.  There are classes in law school which cover just this topic because the area of law is complicated and very important.</p><p>However the simple answer is that the victim will likely best be protected by suing in New Mexico.  This is because the conflict of laws approach generally requires torts—civil wrongs such as negligence in a car accident—to be commenced in the state where the tort occurred.  This means that Cline’s family can commence an action in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico for wrongful death</a>.  While Cline’s family could commence an action in Texas, it is likely to be dismissed or transferred back to New Mexico.</p><p>And this happens a lot.  Truck drivers working for some of the largest trucking companies across the country such as Schneider, Estes, US Parcel, and McLane are usually from Upland, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino, and other nearby cities in California.  This is a major trucking hub which uses New Mexico’s interstates such as I-10 to cut across the country.  When these drivers are injured in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> but live in California, most of them choose to commence an action in New Mexico to protect their rights.</p><p><b>Pedestrian Collisions Caused by Drugged Drivers Brings Serious Liability Issues</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a

TITLE: Rio Rancho Pileup Crash Possibly Caused by Drugs Sends Local Teacher to Hospital; Rio Rancho Personal Injury Attorney Explains

<p><b>Pileup Crash Caused by Possibly Drugged Driver Which Rear-ended Another Car Sends Multiple People to the Hospital; Rio Rancho Personal Injury Attorney Shares Thoughts</b></p><p>Multiple news outlets are reporting a six car pileup in Rio Rancho, New Mexico which has sent several people to the hospital.  This includes a beloved teacher from Rio Rancho High School, Matt Farley.  Police are still investigating the cause of the crash, but believe that one driver, a female motorist driving an Infiniti rear-ended a Volkswagen that was stopped at a red light.  The preliminary investigation shows that the female motorist may have been driving drugged at the time of the subject accident.  No charges have been filed yet, but she may face several charges for starting this <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">dangerous and potentially deadly pileup</a>.</p><p>Here at the<a href="/"> Caruso Law Offices, P.C</a>., our experienced Rio Rancho car accident attorneys have handled many pileup car crashes which have seriously injured or taken the life of victims.  These crashes can be very difficult because there are usually a lot of possible causes to the crash and several possibly liable parties.  But we have the experienced, knowledge, and resources to work with police, private investigators, and do our own investigation to uncover the causes of these accidents.  If you or a loved one have been injured in the above-referenced accident or a similar motor vehicle accident in Rio Rancho, Albuquerque, Las Cruces, or anywhere else in New Mexico, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Liability in Rear End Car Crashes</b></p><p>Whenever a driver rear-ends another vehicle, there is almost always doing to be liability against that rear-ending driver.  This is because there needs to be a non-negligent excuse for rear-ending another vehicle, such as an emergency and unknown medical emergency (i.e. a sudden heart attack) or some other cause outside the control of the driver (i.e., rear-ended by another vehicle and pushed into the rear of another vehicle).</p><p>This is codified in both the common law, or judge-made law, and the statutory law, or legislatively made law.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-318/">NM Stat Section 66-7-318</a>, which governs following too closely, subdivision (A) provides that “[t]he driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.”</p><p>When a driver does this and causes serious <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Personal injuries</a> to another, or like this case causes a pileup car crash, he or she may be automatically liable for the crash under the doctrine of negligence per se.  This doctrine finds a person liable for causing a harm to another person that is protected by the statute.  Here, the New Mexico statute protects all motorists from being injured in rear-end collisions.</p><p><b>Drugged Driving and Motor Vehicles: A Dangerous Combination</b></p><p>The initial police investigation believed that the female driver of the Infiniti was operating her vehicle was under the influence of drugs.  This is just a preliminary finding, and she has not been charged and is innocent until proven guilty.  This post should in no way be considered charging her with guilt of liability.</p><p>But it brings up an interesting point of law and common issues occurring.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/driving-under-influence-of-drugs-more-common-than-alcohol-new-mexico-car-accident-attorney-shares-new-report/">A few months ago we reported that drugged driving was now more common than drunk driving</a>, which is a terrifying finding.  Drugged driving can be just as bad as drunk driving, if not worse.  Motor ability, reaction time, perception, and other important and necessary factors required to safely operate a motor vehicle will be impaired while drugged driving.</p><p>As you would expect, drugged driving is both illegal under the common law and statutory law.  It goes without saying that a motorist must maintain his or her facilities when operating a motor vehicle, and to use the reasonable care that a reasonably prudent driver would under the circumstances.  A reasonably prudent person would not use drugs and drive.</p><p>Under the statutory law, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter66/article8/section66-8-102">NM Stat. 66-8-102</a> makes it “illegal for a person who is under the influence of any drug to a degree that renders the person incapable of safety driving a vehicle to drive a vehicle in this state.”  If a driver drives drugged, it will result in a finding of negligence per se which renders a drugged driver automatically liable.</p><p><b>Rear-end and Drugged Driving Crashes in Rio Rancho Deserve

<p><b>New Mexico State Police Release Independence Day Traffic Statistics, and The Findings are Startling!</b></p><p>Last week we dedicated several blog posts to Independence Day and the traffic dangerous of this holiday.  Indeed, July Fourth is one of the deadliest and most dangerous days for any driver on the road in New Mexico.  Nationally, July 4<sup>th</sup> is a day of the year where the most traffic collisions occur and fatalities.  <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/28/534693676/big-travel-boom-expected-this-fourth-of-july">According to reports</a>, year it was estimated to be the largest year of travel, with more than 44 million Americans traveling 50 miles or more.  This is an increase of almost 3 percent from last year, or a million more people.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know that this means an uptick in serious New Mexico motor vehicle accidents.  This is particularly true on highways or interstates, such as I-10, I-40, and I-25.  Fast moving roadways combined with more traffic and less experienced drivers is a recipe for very serious motor vehicle collisions.  If you or a loved one were serious injured or killed in a New Mexico crash last week, call our experienced Albuquerque motor vehicle accident attorneys by dialing (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation to learn what your rights to compensation may be.</p><p><b>New Mexico Shares Traffic Statistics from July Fourth and the Outcome is SCARY!</b></p><p>According to the <a href="http://www.dchieftain.com/news_stream/state-police-performs-july-traffic-operation/article_57ba0640-61c1-11e7-8d8b-573814247be2.html">New Mexico State Police Report</a>, there were 2,765 traffic citations issued on Independence Day.  Of these, 37 resulted in drunk driving arrests and 16 people were arrested for drug related offenses.  Drunk and drugged driving are one of the most dangerous risks that a driver could take while driving a motor vehicle.  Motor vehicle accidents caused by drunk or drugged driving are negligent and do kill people.</p><p>Of these citations, 283 citations were issued to commercial vehicles.  This includes large trucks such as big rigs, tankers, 18 wheelers, flatbeds, tandem trailers, and other large commercial vehicles.  Citations are generally issued for conduct which puts us all at risk.  Thus they are safely related and meant to safe lives.  When a violation results in the death or injury of another, that can be negligence per se and a victim can receive compensation for his or her injuries due to a truck driver and trucking company’s <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">negligence in causing a truck crash</a>.</p><p>On Independence Day only, there were a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">total of 65 motor vehicle crashes</a>.  That is 2.7 crashes every hour or one every 22 minutes.  That is scary!  Of these, luckily, none were fatal.  But these did result in very serious personal injuries to many victims and these did cause significant bodily harm to victims.</p><p><b>Injured on July Fourth, Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. for Legal Representation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Truck Drivers Don’t Want Victims of New Mexico Trucking Accidents to Know These Things</b></p><p>Victims who have been injured in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious New Mexico trucking accidents</a> have rights to compensation in a personal injury lawsuit that truck drivers and trucking companies do not want you to know about.  Period.  But the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> need to ensure that victims know their rights to compensation.  If you or a loved one have been injured in a New Mexico trucking crash, call us immediately to learn how we can protect your rights by dialing (505) 883-5000 today.</p><p><b>Secrets Truck Drivers Don’t Want You Knowing</b></p><p>Truck drivers that make mistakes on the highway or interstates such as I-40, I-25, or I-10 can <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/practice-areas/trucking-accident-overview/fatal-truck-accidents/">easily kill occupants of passenger vehicles</a>.  When this happens, victims have many tools to win a lawsuit and obtain compensation against the trucking company and truck driver.  But they don’t want victims to know about these things.  Here are some important things to know to win:</p><p><em>Hours of Service Regularly are Regularly Violated</em> – Trucking companies and truck drivers must follow federal hours of service regulations.  However, trucking is a business and time is money.  Truck drivers regularly lie on their log books or inaccurately keep time.  They stretch their hours of sleeping or resting to they can continue driving more than legally allowed.  However, almost all trucks have computers on their engines which monitor time being used and time not used.  This can be downloaded and you can establish that the hours of service regulations were being violated.</p><p><em>Many Truck Drivers are Abusing Caffeine or Drugs to Stay Awake</em> – Driving across the country constantly can be very tiring.  Especially when you do it several times and are constantly driving.  This is why truck drivers need to help keep themselves awake by taking caffeine supplements or other products to stay awake.  Yet there is no real replacement for sleep to make yourself awake, alert, and ready.  Some truck drivers even turn to illegal drugs such as cocaine and other stimulants to keep them awake longer and able to drive longer.  This can affect a driver’s ability to react to traffic patterns; drugged driving and driving under the influence or while ability impaired is illegal.  Truck drivers don’t want victims to know how common it really is.</p><p><em>Truck Drivers are Taught to Rear End the Vehicle in Front of Them Rather Than Try to Truck Away</em> – If a truck driver is not paying attention or is unable to stop in time before rear ending another vehicle, truck drivers are actually taught to rear end that vehicle instead of trying to swerve at the last second.  The reason is that swerving could result in the truck jackknifing, flipping over, or hitting multiple other vehicles instead of just one.  If a truck blocks an entire highway, many more people could be seriously injured or killed instead of just the victims in one vehicle.  Thus, the car in the front is a sacrifice in a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accident</a>.  Truck drivers are also taught that swerving can result in them getting killed, whereas in a rear end collision it is entirely unlikely.</p><p><b>Truck Drivers Hate This Blog Post, But You Should Bookmark it And Call if You or a Loved One Are Every Hurt in a New Mexico Trucking Accident</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Independence Day is a Known Holiday for More Car Accidents: If You Were a Victim, Get Medical Treatment Then Call a New Mexico Car Crash Lawyer</b></p><p>Independence Day is one of the largest traffic days of the year.  This also means it is one of the <a href="https://www.today.com/money/july-4th-traffic-7-driving-tips-deadliest-day-road-t100429">most dangerous and deadliest days</a> to be a motorist on the road.  If you were seriously injured or lost a loved one in a car crash on Independence Day, now is not the time to be a hero and “walk it off” regarding your injuries.  If you are hurt, you need to get medical treatment and tell your doctors what hurts now.  Do not delay.  This can hurt your lawsuit.</p><p>After you get your medical treatment, you need to contact an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car crash lawyer like those at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>  We have handled many motor vehicle accidents occurring on or near holidays and work with families to protect the rights of their loved ones.  Call us today for a FREE consultation to learn your rights to compensation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Step One: After a Car Accidents Get Medical Attention</b></p><p>It should be obvious, but if you are really hurt you need to call 911 and obtain medical treatment.  This needs to be done right away.  Never refuse necessary medical treatment.</p><p>If you are injured but refused medical treatment, you really should reconsider for several reasons.  First, this is your body and if you do not take care of your injuries now, you may not be able to repair the damage done later.  Second, delaying treatment after your motor vehicle accident can actually harm your case.</p><p>For example, if you wait months to seek treatment for a back or head injury, a competent defense attorney will attack the gap in treatment between your <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a> and seeking treatment.  This effects the causation of the accident.  Meaning that the accident may not be causally related to the accident.  Said differently, the accident may not have caused your injuries.  This is why you need to immediately get medical treatment when you are hurt.</p><p>Additionally, to a jury or defendant it may appear that you are just seeking money for your prior existing injuries or trying to abuse the system.  If this happens you will likely end up with nothing or much lower than what you are entitled to.  Do not be a hero.  Explain everything that aches, even if just a little bit of pain, make sure you explain it to the doctor and get it documented in your medical records.</p><p><b>Step Two: After Medical Treatment, Call a New Mexico Car Crash Lawyer</b></p><p>After you have been injured in a motor vehicle accident, you should contact competent legal representation like the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.  You do not have as long as you would like to commence a lawsuit.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter37/article1/section37-1-8">NM Stat. 37-1-8</a>, you only have three years from the date of your accident to commence a lawsuit.  This is known as the statute of limitations period and it is a time limit on your lawsuit.  If you fail to commence a lawsuit within this time limit, your case will likely be dismissed.</p><p>Further, a personal injury lawsuit is very complicated.  The defendant will blame you for the accident or claim you are not as injured as you claim.  The insurance companies will try to trick you into taking less money or not give you what you desire.  Lost wages will pile up and are difficult to claim.  Medical insurance will want to be paid back from car insurance.  The other driver may not even be insured.  If you are on the job, workers’ compensation will add a nightmare.  The defendant may even counter claim and sue YOU for the car accident.</p><p>These can effect both your rights to compensation and your wallet.  Additionally, police and law enforcement may investigate the cause of the accident and if you are not represented, you may not be able to present your side well-enough to demonstrate you did not cause the accident.  All of these claims require you to obtain experienced counsel.</p><p><b>Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. for Legal Representation in your New Mexico Car Crash After a July Fourth Accident</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Truck Driver Falls Asleep While Driving on I-40: Cargo is Radioactive Material—What Happens if Someone Was Hurt?</b></p><p>It’s a nightmare scenario that was luckily avoided.  News outlets are reporting that a truck driver on Interstate 40 feel asleep while driving.  He was driving a large commercial truck which left the roadway and rolled onto its side on the I-40 eastbound lane near mile marker 132.  The cargo was Cesium 137—a radioactive material.  Luckily no one was hurt, but this could have been catastrophic!</p><p>There are several liability issues here that are relevant to a person who could have been hurt in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>.  As experienced New Mexico trucking crash attorneys from Albuquerque, New Mexico, we have handled many <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking collisions on Interstate 40</a>.  If you or a loved one were hurt in an interstate trucking accident, call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn your rights today.</p><p><b>Dangerous Cargo and Trucking Accidents in New Mexico</b></p><p>This motor vehicle involved radioactive material.  This is a dangerous cargo.  While it is somewhat uncommon, radioactive material does get transported regularly.  However, there are many more dangerous types of cargo which can be just as deadly to victims.  Most of these are chemicals including acids or gasoline.  These are also very dangerous.</p><p>When a victim of a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a> is injured in the collision, the chemicals and cargo can be just as damaging as the actually impact.  A trucking company and a truck driver are liable for the secondary damages caused by the cargo.</p><p>Commonly the cargo will result in a fire.  A fire is secondary to the impact of the trucking crash.  The fire can be just as deadly if not more deadly.  Fires easily kill or seriously injury.  Victims can suffer significant pain and suffering if they are trapped in the mangled wreck and cannot escape a fire which eventually consumes them.  The <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, have handled many cases with similar facts and recovered compensation for the victims.</p><p><b>Truckers Who Fall Asleep at the Wheel are Negligent</b></p><p>As unbelievable as it sounds, a truck driver actually fell asleep while driving a truck with radioactive material.  Not only is this negligence as a matter of law under the common law, or judge-made law, but is just sounds reckless.  If anyone was injured due to the crash or the secondary damage caused by radioactive material, victims would absolutely be entitled to compensation.  A jury would be very unsympathetic to a truck driver in this situation.</p><p>This accident occurred on an interstate.  Because there are so many states that America’s interstates use, federal regulations apply to cover all states and set a minimum standard.  Driving while sleep impaired is covered in the federal regulations.</p><p>Under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.392#se49.5.392_13">49 CFR 392.3</a>, “[n]o driver shall operate a commercial motor vehicle, and a motor carrier shall not require or permit a driver to operate a commercial motor vehicle, while the driver’s ability or alertness is so impaired, or so likely to become impaired, through fatigue, illness, or any other cause, as to make it unsafe for him/her to begin or continue to operate the commercial motor vehicle.”</p><p>Thus, victims of a trucking accident who are injured due to a driver who falls asleep, the victims will be entitled to compensation for his or her injuries under the federal regulations and under the common law.</p><p><b>Truck Drivers Who Fall Asleep While Driving on Interstates with Dangerous Cargo are Simply Negligent</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Speed Kills, Especially When New Mexico Trucks Speed on Interstates</b></p><p>In case you did not already know, speed kills.  <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812021">According to statistics</a>, speed-related crashes cost $40.4 billion and resulted in over 10,000 deaths.  Approximately 30 percent (30%) of all motor vehicle accidents are caused or contributed to by speeding.  Among male drivers, seventy-four percent (74%) of fatal speed-related crashes were between 15 to 24 years old.  For females, forty percent (40%) of fatal speed-related crashes were between 15 to 24 years old.  In New Mexico, 365 people were killed in the last year of statistics due to speeding.  That’s one a day.</p><p>The only thing more dangerous than speeding, is <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">speeding in a large commercial truck </a>such as a big rig, semi, 18-wheeler, tanker, flatbed, tandem trailer, double trailer, or other large truck.  These vehicle are already very heavy and difficult to maneuver.  They require a lot of time to brake and slow down.  Speeding not only increases the difficulty to maneuver and the destine it requires to stop, but also decreases the driver’s reaction time to begin braking.  This is clearly a recipe for disaster.</p><p>At the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico trucking crash attorneys</a> know this.  We have handled many motor vehicle accidents caused by excessive speed, particularly involving large commercial trucks.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking crash</a> caused by excessive speed, call us today by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help get you the maximum amount of compensation that you may be entitled to.</p><p><b>Speeding is Against the Law: How to Prove Liability With a Traffic Ticket</b></p><p>Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-301/">New Mexico Law Stat. 66-7-301 (d)</a>, “[i]n every event, speed shall be so controlled by the driver as may be necessary: (1) to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle or other conveyance on or entering the highway; (2) to comply with legal requirements as may be established by the state highway and transportation department or the New Mexico state police division of department of public safety and the duty of all persons to use due car . . . .”</p><p>If a driver causes a motor vehicle accident due to speeding and a violation of this section of law, a victim can use this violation against the speeder.  The doctrine of negligence per se  allows a victim to use to violation of a traffic law to establish negligence where the traffic law was intended to protect the victim from the harm that the violation occurred.  In this case, the speeding statute prevents victims from being hurt in motor vehicle accidents caused by speeding drivers.  Therefore, a victim will be able to prove his or her case to win.</p><p>In a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accident</a>, the victim can also show the trucking company as well.  This is because the truck driver is working on behalf of the trucking company.  Thus, the trucking company will be vicariously liable for the negligence of the truck driver.  This is important because it allows a victim to receive compensation under the trucking company’s insurance policy.</p><p><b>Speed Kills, and Truck Drivers that Speed in New Mexico are Killing More and More Innocent Motorists Each Year</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque, New Mexico Car Accidents Can Cause Catastrophic Injuries Resulting in the Permanent Paralysis: Victims May Be Entitled to Compensation for Future Care and Pain and Suffering as a Result</b></p><p>One of everyone’s worst fears is a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious car wreck</a>, especially one with a large commercial truck.  These crashes can be catastrophic and devastating, causing serious injuries and killing victims.  To those lucky enough to survive, victims may be left with rather debilitating conditions affecting them for the rest of their lives.  Unfortunately, a common debilitating and permanent injury is paralysis of a portion or large majority of a victim’s body.</p><p>Victims of Albuquerque car wrecks who are no paraplegic, quadriplegic, or otherwise paralyzed as a result of a serious motor vehicle accident should call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> immediately to learn what rights to compensation they may have.  These victims are entitled to not just their past pain and suffering and medical bills, but also compensation for their future care and future pain and suffering which many personal injury attorneys may forget or not be skilled enough to obtain.  Our experienced Albuquerque car accidents attorneys know how to prove these claims and obtain the maximum amount a victim may be entitled to.  Call us today for a FREE consultation to learn how we can help you or your loved one by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Understanding Paralysis: Paraplegia and Quadriplegia Defined</b></p><p>Serious motor vehicle crashes can result in life-long injuries including paraplegia and quadriplegia.  It is important that those who have suffered serious injuries know the full-extent of these medical conditions.  Some people may have one of these conditions and not know it, but may be entitled to very significant compensation for these injuries.</p><p><a href="https://www.disabled-world.com/definitions/paraplegia.php">Paraplegia is defined</a> as an impairment, injury, or damage to the motor or sensory function or the lower extremities usually caused by a spinal cord injury.  The spinal cord is what sends messages from the brain to the extremities to tell control them to move or receive sensation such as pain, pressure, moisture, or heat.  Paraplegia is the injury to both lower extremities.  People with paraplegia may still be able to walk, but are likely dependent and canes, wheelchairs, walkers, or other devices to assist with walking.</p><p><a href="https://www.disabled-world.com/definitions/quadriplegia.php">Quadriplegia is defined</a> as paralysis that results in the partial or total loss of use of a person’s limbs and torso.  This loss is usually sensory and motor, which generally means a person cannot move or sense.  Thus, quadriplegia is the paralysis of all four limbs.  This is caused from a high spinal cord injury, such as in the neck or cervical spine.  Some feeling or movement may be in some locations of the body, but overall a complete lack of ability to sense or move is present.</p><p><b>Types of New Mexico Car Crashes Resulting in Paralysis</b></p><p>It is important to know that <i>any</i> type of motor vehicle accident can result in paralysis of any part of a person’s body.  This means any speed, any vehicle, any angle, and to any person.  Motor vehicles are large and dangerous objects moving at high speeds.  The human body, while resilient, is simply not made to withstand impacts with large metal objects.</p><p>There are certain types of motor vehicle accidents which are more likely to cause paralyzing injuries, including with large commercial trucks such as semis, tandem trailers, big rigs, 18-wheelers, and other massive vehicles.  Some common types of crashes resulting in paralysis with an explanation include the following:</p><p>– <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Trucking accidents</a> – these are large vehicles with a lot of force to disperse in a collision, resulting in a lot of potential for injury;</p><p>–<a href="https://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"> Motorcycle crashes</a> – motorcycle riders are not protected with seatbelts, airbags, or even in a steel shell to protect them, and they are more likely to sustain serious injury to their spine in collisions;</p><p>– Interstate collisions – I-40, I-25, I-10, and the other major highways doing through New Mexico are very dangerous because high-speed collisions cause more force, which result in more serious impacts and injuries;</p><p>– T-bone crashes – Any side-impact or t-bone crash is devastating because the driver hit on the side only has a small amount of metal and protection from the large engine block of the other vehicle acting as a battering ram;</p><p>– Rear end collisions – Impacts from the rear place significant stress on the spine, particularly the cervical or neck, which can result in damage to the spinal cord and paralysis;</p><p>– Roll over accidents – when a vehicle rolls over, the passengers are thrown about inside at a high-speed in different directions which can cause serious injury to the spine;</p><p>– Ejectment accidents – if a vehicle is hit with such force that a passenger is ejected from the vehicle, it can obviously cause serious and significant injuries to an unprotected person;</p><p>– Pedestrian knockdowns – when a pedestrian is hit by a vehicle, the pedestrian is likely to suffer horrible head, neck, and back injuries for the sole reason that he or she is not protected by any safety devices; and</p><p>– Many other serious causes.</p><p><b>Any Paralysis Injury Caused by an Albuquerque Car Accident Should be Evaluated by the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact

<p><b>Unsafe Lane Changes Can Result in Deadly New Mexico Interstate Car Accidents</b></p><p>Driving on an interstate or fast-moving highway is a challenge for even the most experienced of drivers.  This is particularly true of New Mexico’s interstates such as I-40, I-25, and I-10 because many commercial trucking companies use these roads to transport goods from east to west and north to south.  This means that large commercial trucks such as semis, tandem trailers, tankers, flatbeds, big rigs, 18-wheelers, and other trucks are merging on and off the highways and changing lanes frequently.  Around some of the busier cities such as Albuquerque, New Mexico and Las Cruces, New Mexico which have more passenger cars on the roads, this can become particularly dangerous or deadly stretches of road due to the congestion of other vehicles on the roads.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been serious injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car crash</a> caused by an improper lane change, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We have represented many victims of motor vehicle accidents occurring on the interstates in New Mexico, including passengers, infants, and even other truck drivers such as those in Ontario, California, traveling through New Mexico.  Call us today to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation.  There is no risk, and you will only pay us if we win your case.  To find out more, contact us today!</p><p><b>Interstate New Mexico Car Crashes Caused by an Improper Lane Change is Negligent</b></p><p>The violation of a statute which causes harm to a protected class is known as negligence per se.  It is an automatic finding of negligence by the very happening of the event.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-317/">New Mexico Law, NM Stat. 66-7-317 (a)</a> provides that “a vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.”</p><p>This means if a driver moves from his or her lane and into yours and collides with your vehicle, that driver will be liable for your injuries because he or she will automatically be found negligent as a matter of law.  This is a very important principle to be aware of and to know, as it can be used to prove your case.</p><p>If the defendant is a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">truck driver in your interstate trucking accident</a>, you will be able to commence an action against the truck driver and against the trucking company.  This is important because it gives you avenues on where to seek compensation and how to obtain your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Unsafe Lane Changes Can Cause Deadly New Mexico Car Crashes on the Interstate </b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Sometimes Lost Wages Can be the Largest Part of Your Recovery in a New Mexico Motor Vehicle Accident, And All Victims Should Know Their Rights to Compensation</b></p><p>When most people think of a motor vehicle crash, they think of the pain and suffering and the hospital bills which they will ensure and may obtain compensation for in a lawsuit.  While this is certainly true and is the most commonly sought damages, a victim can also obtain his or her lost wages from work.  In fact, a lost wage claim can actually be even greater than a pain and suffering claim if the victim suffered severe injuries keeping him or her out of work for a long period of time.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico motor vehicle accident</a> attorneys know that victims need to be compensated for their lost wages.  Many families depend on these wages and when a family member supporting the household can no longer work, it can create a great burden on the rest of the family.  If you or a loved one have been injured and unable to work, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Lost Wage Claims Are Available to All Motorists Injured in New Mexico Accidents</b></p><p>Where a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">victim of a motor vehicle accident</a> is seriously injured and out of work for several months, he or she may have an extended lost wage claim.  A lost wage claim is simply the lost wages that the victim would have earned if he or she had not been injured.  It is simply lost time from work.  The more seriously injured a victim is and the longer away from work, the greater the lost wages.</p><p>This is why victims of New Mexico trucking accidents have some of the largest lost wages claims.  Trucking crashes with large commercial vehicles such as big rigs, 18 wheelers, tankers, flatbeds, semis, tandem trailers, and other large trucks will cause devastating wrecks and catastrophic injuries.  This means a victim will be away from work longer, and will miss more salary.  This means a higher lost wage claim.</p><p><b>A Truck Driver’s Lost Wage Claims</b></p><p>Truckers who are also working in national companies like Schneider, Estes, FedEx, and other large trucking companies may also be injured in New Mexico.  Indeed, New Mexico has some of the busiest interstates in the country.  I-40, I-25, and I-10 are very busy and important hubs for trucking companies sending goods coast to coast.</p><p>Sometimes these <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">truck drivers fall victim to serious traffic accidents</a> due to the negligence of another truck driver or other drivers.  The Caruso Law Offices, P.C. has represented many such injured truck drivers, including those from Ontario and Upland, California, who are traveling through New Mexico.  Many times truck drivers, even if just incapacitated for several weeks or months, could have large lost wage claims.</p><p><b>Victims of New Mexico Motor Vehicle Accidents Should Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. If They Have a Lost Wage Claim</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Serious Motor Vehicle Accidents Can Cause Serious Pelvic Fracture</b></p><p>One of the most serious types of fractures that a person can sustain is of the pelvis.  This is because the pelvis is very strong and sturdy, and it takes a lot of force to fracture the pelvis.  When the pelvis is fractured, it is often very dangerous because there are a lot of very vital structures running through that area, including major blood vessels, organs, and nerves.  Pelvic fractures may also cause extensive bleeding which must be quickly treated.</p><p>This is why a motor vehicle accident is one of the most common causes of a pelvic fracture, more than slip and falls or disease conditions.  The most common type of motor vehicle accident causing a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">pelvic fracture is a trucking accident</a>, such as with a semi trailer, tandem truck,  big rig, 18-wheeler, tanker, and other large commercial truck.  This is because these types of trucks have a lot of weight and speed which means they have a lot of force and momentum.</p><p><b>Anatomy of the Pelvis</b></p><p>The pelvis is not made up of a lot of bones, but all of these bones are rather sturdy and rather important.  The sacrum is the triangular-shaped bone at the base of the spine which makes up the center of the pelvis.  The coccyx or tailbone is the very bottom of the sacrum.</p><p>Then there are the hip bones, which are the illium (the wings of the hips), ischium (ringed-shape bone at the bottom of the pelvis), and the pubis (narrow segment of bone between the ilium and ischium in the center of the pelvis near the base of the coccyx).  The three hip bones form a “cup,” known as the acetabulum socket, which is where the femur or leg bone connect.</p><p><b>Types of Pelvis Fractures Caused by Albuquerque Motor Vehicle Accidents</b></p><p>There are two general types of fractures of the pelvis.  These are a stable fracture and an unstable fracture.  A stable fracture is where there is just one break, the fractured ends line up, and the bones are not really shifting or moving.</p><p>An unstable fracture is whether there are two or more breaks, the fractured ends of the bones do not line up, and the bones may shift or move.  An unstable fracture is very common in high-speed collisions, particularly <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">interstate collisions on Interstate 10, Interstate 25, and Interstate 40</a>.  These types of collisions are frequently caused by trucking collisions.</p><p><i>Types of Stable Fractures</i></p><p>There are three main types of stable pelvic fractures which could be caused by a motor vehicle accident.  The first is where the iliac wing (the hip bone) is fractured.  This is the large bone that flares out to the sides of the spine at the hip.  The second is a sacrum fracture, which is the base of the spine.  The third is a pubic rim fracture, which is the ring-shaped bone at the bottom of the hip that breaks.</p><p><i>Types of Unstable Fractures</i></p><p>There are also three main types of unstable pelvic fractures which could be caused by a motor vehicle accident, but are most likely in a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking crash</a>.  The first is an anterior-posterior compression fracture which is where the iliac wing (shaped hip bone) and where the pubis bones on the left and right side meet in the middle.</p><p>The second type is a lateral compression fracture.  This type of fracture is very common in serious motor vehicle accident because the pelvis is struck and crushed inward.  The iliac wing, pubic, and ischium usually all break and curl towards the center of the body.  Think of a side-impact collision like a t-bone which hits an occupant and pushes all the bones inwards.</p><p>The third type is a vertical shear fracture.  This is another common type of fracture caused by a car accident.  This is where one half of the pelvis is pushed upwards and the base of the iliac wing, pubis, and ischium all fracture at or near the midpoint.   These types of fractures are also common in serious motor vehicle crashes where the metal of the car is very serious jolted and mangled, popping the occupant up in his or her seat even though there is a seatbelt on.</p><p><b>If You Have a Pelvis Fracture Caused by an Albuquerque Car Accident or Albuquerque Trucking Accident, Call our Experienced Attorneys Today to Learn How We Can Protect Your Rights to Compensation!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Shocking Trucking Accident Statistics You Must Know and Share with Loved Ones</b></p><p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Highway Loss Data Institute just released horrifying and shocking statistics regarding trucking accidents.  Here at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C., we know how dangerous trucking accidents can be but most of our clients are surprised when they are involved in one.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys</a> have handled many trucking crash cases, even simple bumper taps, which have resulted in permanent and life-threatening injuries.  Unfortunately, many people have also been killed in these types of truck crashes.</p><p>Here are some findings from the study and comments from our law office:</p><p><b>Most deaths in large truck crashes are the occupants of passenger vehicles</b>.  It seems like almost every <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com"><b>trucking accident case</b></a> involves a family in a passenger car being serious injured or killed while a truck driver walks away with minor injuries, if any.  According to the statistics, 69% of the people killed in a truck crash were the occupants of other vehicles—not the large truck.  There were 3,852 fatalities in trucking crashes, which equates to 10.5 people killed <i>each day</i>.</p><p>This is because commercial trucks such as big rigs, 18 wheelers, tankers, flatbeds, tandem trailers, semi trucks, and other large trucks tower over smaller passenger cars placing the truck driver higher up and out of danger, but lining up the passenger occupants with the large tires or engine block.  Large trucks also have significant momentum due to their large size and heavy weight, which sends powerful shockwaves through passenger vehicles causing serious injuries.  Simply put, the occupants of the passenger vehicle are more vulnerable.</p><p><b>Truck braking capacity can be a factor in causing truck crashes</b>.  Given their large size and heavy weight, large commercial trucks can take 20 to 40 percent farther than other vehicles to come to a stop.  This distance is magnified on fast roads such as interstates I-40, I-25, and I-10 going through New Mexico, or during dust storms or on wet roads.  If a truck’s brakes are poorly maintained, they can cause even longer stopping distances.  Rear end truck crashes can easily result in the <b>wrongful death of an innocent person</b>.</p><p><b>Truck driver fatigues is a known crash risk, and a serious contributing factor.  </b>Even though federal regulations have hours of services requirements, many trucking companies and truck drivers push the limits and even forge their service logs.  Many drivers use caffeine supplements or even illegal drugs to help them stay away while driving, which can obviously add to the risk.</p><p><b>If You or a Loved One Are Seriously Injured in an Albuquerque Trucking Accident, Call us Today!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Rear End Truck Accident Kills Two from Roswell on US 70 near Elida, New Mexico: New Mexico Trucking Accident Attorney Explains the Rights and Liabilities</b></p><p>According to <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/976237/state-police-two-from-roswell-killed-in-friday-crash.html">multiple news outlets</a>, a horrible motor vehicle crash occurred on March 25, 2017 at about 2:15 PM on US 70 just south of Elida, New Mexico.  Alexander Horton and Leonard Padilla, both from Roswell, New Mexico were killed when the semi truck driven by Jack Pulliam of Amarillo, Texas rear ended the vehicle they were passengers in.</p><p>Alexander Horton and Leonard Padilla were passengers in the vehicle driven by Stephanie Yamteh who also is from Roswell.  She sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas.  Jack Pulliam, the young truck driver, was taken to Roosevelt General Hospital in Portales, and treated for minor injuries.</p><p>US 70 is a major highway cutting across southern New Mexico.  It crosses with some of the largest trucking highways and interstates in the county, including I-25 in Las Cruces, New Mexico and I-10 in Lordsburg, New Mexico.  Major trucking companies such as Estes, FedEx, US Parcel, Schneider International, and other companies frequently use these highways to ship cargo throughout the United States.</p><p>Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> have seen many fatal trucking accidents in this corridor.  If you or a loved one have been serious injured or killed in this area, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Wrongful Death Actions in New Mexico</b></p><p>There is nothing that can be said or done to bring back a life lost due to the negligence of a truck driver.  No amount of compensation and no amount of punishment for the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">negligent truck driver or trucking company</a>.  Human life is just not replaceable.</p><p>New Mexico law attempts to help compensate a family such as the Hortons and the Padillas by allowing a family to commence a wrongful death lawsuit.  <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter41/article2/section41-2-1">NM Stat. 41-2-1 defines a wrongful death</a> as a death that was caused by a wrongful act, neglect, or default of another.  A rear end truck accident easily fits that classification.</p><p>The purpose of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death lawsuit</a> is for two main reasons.  The first is to compensate the victim’s family for the loss of their loved one’s love and affection, services, consortium, and financial support.  A victim’s family can also seek compensation for their loved one’s pain and suffering which ultimately caused his or her death.  The second purpose is to punish the negligent party to help serve as a deterrent to stop causing accidents and injuries such as these.</p><p><b>Rear End Trucking Accidents on the Interstate are Almost Always Negligent</b></p><p>When one driver rear ends another vehicle, it is almost always negligent unless there is a non-negligent excuse.  There almost never is a non-negligent excuse in a rear end crash on the interstate.  This is because following too closely is a violation of the vehicle and traffic law.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-318/">NM Stat 66-7-318</a>, “[t]he driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.”  When a truck rear ends another vehicle on an interstate, such truck is likely violating this statute and negligent as a matter of law.</p><p>This is very serious.  Large commercial vehicles such as big rigs, semi truck, tandem trailers, and other large trucks which rear end a smaller passenger vehicle almost always kill if not seriously injury passengers in the other vehicle.  Which is what occurred here on US 70 to Alexander Horton, Leonard Padilla, and Stephanie Yamteh.</p><p>From the limited facts of this case, and based on the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.’s</a> experience handling similar cases, there could be many causes of this accident including the following:</p><ul><li>Excessive speed or speeding of the truck driver;</li><li>Fatigued driving by the truck driver, such as violating the hours of service regulations;</li><li>Drunk driving of the truck driver;</li><li>Drugged driving by the truck driver, particularly drugs to help stay awake or stimulants;</li><li>Truck driver inexperience, particularly given that the truck driver was only 22 years old;</li><li>Inadequate training for the truck driver by the truck company;</li><li>Dust storms or weather requiring the truck driver to slow down;</li><li>Distracted driving such as on a cell phone of playing with the radio;</li><li>Mechanical failure of the truck such as brakes or steering wheel failure; and</li><li>Many other causes.</li></ul><p><b>Roswell Trucking Accident Victims Should Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. for Legal Representation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident,

BODY:
<p><b>These New Mexico Cities Have the Worst Ranked Intersections for Fatal Car Accidents in the Entire State!</b></p><p>Intersections are the most dangerous portion of the road and travel pattern that a driver can encounter.  Unfortunately, most drivers encounter an intersection several times a day.  While most drivers successfully navigate these intersections, far too many people do not leave them alive.  Indeed, intersections kill more people each year than any other portion of a roadway.  And the reason is simple—cars from multiple sides are all coming together to a single point at the same time.  Even traffic light or traffic signed controlled intersections are still downright dangerous.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we handle many motor vehicle crashes at intersections which result in the wrongful death of a victim.  If you or a loved one have been serious injured or killed in a New Mexico intersection crash, call our experienced Albuquerque car accidents attorneys for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will advise you of your rights and right to ensure you get the maximum compensation you may be entitled to.</p><p><b>List of New Mexico Cities with the Worst Intersections</b></p><p>According to the New Mexico Department of Transportation, the fifty worst intersections were ranked by the total number of motor vehicle crashes for three consecutive years.  After reviewing the data, the New Mexico cities with the worst Intersections are the following:</p><p>Albuquerque, New Mexico</p><p>There are more dangerous and deadly intersections in Albuquerque, New Mexico than anywhere else in the state.  In fact, the top <b>13 worst </b>intersections were all in Albuquerque! And a majority of the list is from Albuquerque.</p><p>Paseo Del Norte Blvd NW and Paseo Del Norte Blvd NE contributed to over 250 fatal crashes which is more than any other three streets on the list.  The <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">most dangerous intersection for car accidents</a> was Paseo Del Norte Blvd NW and Coors Blvd NW, and the second worst was Paseo Del Norte Blvd NE and Jefferson St NE.  Other dangerous portions of Paseo Del Norte Blvd are NE and Pan American East Highway NE, and NW and 2nd St NW.</p><p>Other dangerous roads with deadly intersections in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque for car crashes</a> were San Mateo Blvd NE, Montgomery Blvd NE, Coors Blvd NW, and Wyoming Blvd NE.  Of all the cities on this list, Albuquerque, New Mexico absolutely had the most crashes, the most injuries, and the most deaths than any other of the cities on the list.  While most of these intersections have  fatality and injury rate between 25% and 29%, the intersections of Central Ave W and Unser Blvd NW and Indian School Road NE and Sant Mateo Blvd NE both had a 38% fatality and injury rate—second highest on the list!</p><p>Las Cruces, New Mexico</p><p>While Las Cruces does not have nearly as many intersections on the list, motor vehicle crashes here are likely to cause serious injury or be fatal then <b><i>any other intersection on the list!</i></b>  In fact, Las Cruces, New Mexico holds the highest percentage and third highest percentage rate of injury or death in an intersection crash.  The worst was a 41% fatality and injury rate at Elks Dr and Main St.  This is the highest on the list and scary that almost half the time a person will be seriously injured or killed in a crash!.  The third worst on the list is Main St and Solano Drive in Las Cruces, New Mexico has a 37% fatality and injury rate.</p><p>Another reason why Las Cruces has such a high percentage of injury and fatality rates is simply because this is a major trucking hub and there are <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">a lot of New Mexico trucking accidents occurring here</a>.  Indeed, trucking companies across the country like Schneider, US Parcel, Estes, McLane, FedEx, and other large companies use New Mexico’s popular interstate highway system to ship cargo coast to coast and north to south.  At Las Cruces, this includes where I-25 and I-10 meet to switch north to south and east to west.  US Route 70 and US Route 180 are also very popular routes adding to the danger of motor vehicle accidents.</p><p>Santa Fe, New Mexico</p><p>While there are not many Santa Fe cities on the list, the one that is on the list carries a one in four chance to seriously hurt or kill a person in a crash.  This is Cerrillos Rd and St Francis Dr, and has caused over 150 crashes in three years with almost 40 killing or seriously hurting a victim.  Cerrillos Rd and Zafarano Dr is also a very serious intersection, where 30% of the people involved in a crash are seriously hurt or killed.</p><p>Española, New Mexico</p><p>While only one intersection makes the list, it has resulted in a fatality or serious injury in 37% of the motor vehicle accidents which is tied third for the worst intersection.  The intersection of Fairview Lane and Riverside Drive is incredibly deadly and single handedly gets Española on the list.</p><p>Farmington, New Mexico</p><p>This is the last non-Albuquerque city on the list.  The intersection of 30th St and Main St has seriously injured or killed 21% of the drivers and passengers.  Motorist should use extreme care when traveling on this intersection as well.</p><p><b>The Caruso Law Offices, P.C.

<p><b>Memorial Day Car Accidents are Common in New Mexico For Several Reasons</b></p><p>Memorial Day is a time for remembering the sacrifices that members of our armed services have made for our country and us.  Thus sacrifices could be serving and spending time away from family and friends, or paying the ultimate sacrifice for our country.  But it is a day to remember the fallen and their families for helping preserve our freedom.</p><p>But Memorial Day has evolved for many of us into times with family and friends BBQing and traveling.  It is known as the official start of the summer.  And it is also known as a time to relax from work and enjoy the usually nice weather.  However, this also means more motor vehicle accidents, serious injuries, and <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">even wrongful deaths</a>.  There are several reasons why for this, which include the following:</p><p><b>1) Alcohol/Drug Related Accidents</b> – Alcohol and drugs should never be a contributing cause to any motor vehicle accident—they are very preventable causes.  However, on the big picnic day like Memorial Day, alcohol and drug related accidents are very high and result in horrific personal injuries.  Driving while intoxicated or under the influence of a drug is illegal by both statutory law and common law.  If alcohol or drugs is a cause of a car accident, the victim can be compensated for his or her injuries.</p><p><b>2) Excessive Speed</b> – People are rushing to get to their parties and BBQs.  Many people are using some of New Mexico’s largest interstates such as I-40, I-25, and I-10.  These interstates are inhabited by <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com"><b>large commercial trucks lie big rigs, tandem trailers, tankers, 18 wheelers, and other large trucks which could cause serious trucking crashes</b></a>.  When motorists are driving at an excessive speed over the limit, or when large trucks are, it can result in catastrophic and deadly interstates accidents.  Las Cruces and Albuquerque are where two large interstates meet, which is also where a lot of high speed collisions occur.  Speed kills and is a major contributor to New Mexico car accidents.</p><p><b>3) Heavy Traffic</b> – Holidays such as Memorial Day bring a lot of people out and onto the roads.  This means that there will be more traffic and congestion on the roads.  Simply put, this means more things to hit.  When you combine alcohol, drugs, and speeding as noted above, this is a simple recipe for devastating crashes which can kill people.</p><p><b>4) Inexperienced Drivers</b> – Because it is a holiday, many people will be on the roads who are not comfortable with driving.  Some people only go out for special events, particularly elderly drivers who may only go out a few times a year.  Also more younger drivers get out for the beginning of the summer and enjoy having this as a major hang out holiday.  The combination of al the factors above and the inexperienced drivers will cause a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><b>significant number of motor vehicle accidents</b></a> which will, unfortunately, result in the serious injury or wrongful death of victims.</p><p><b>Call the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. to Learn How We Can Help Get Your Compensation for Memorial Day Car Accidents</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Motor Vehicle Accidents Causing Large Chain Crashes or Interstate Pileups is Usually Caused by Negligence</b></p><p>Even just a single vehicle accident is dangerous enough, and the most common type of motor vehicle accident is a two vehicle accident.  But large chain crashes or interstate pileups involving five, ten, fifteen, or even more vehicles can be outright deadly.  This is particularly true on some of New Mexico’s interstates such as I-10, I-25, and I-40, which are <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">major tractor trailer and trucking routes throughout the United States</a>.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico motor vehicle accident attorneys</a> know that chain crashes and large interstate pileup accidents can cause serious injury or death.  Victims of these accidents are entitled to compensation, and should call us for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Common Causes of Chain Crashes and Interstate Pileup Crashes</b></p><p>There are many causes to any type of motor vehicle accident, but interstate chain crashes and highway pileups are almost always caused by negligence.  And usually the negligence of several different parties.  Some common causes include the following:</p><p>– Speeding or driving excessively fast;</p><p>– Failing to yield;</p><p>– Dust storms or other weather events;</p><p>– Failing to guard against ice or other slippery conditions;</p><p>– Failing to slow down as reasonable in a dust storm;</p><p>– Road rage;</p><p>– Drowsy driving or driving while fatigued;</p><p>– Drunk driving;</p><p>-Drugged driving;</p><p>– Improper lane changes;</p><p>– Following too closely or tailgating;</p><p>– Slamming on the brakes;</p><p>– Tire blowouts; and</p><p>– Many other causes.</p><p><b>Liability in Chain Crashes or Interstate Pileups</b></p><p>Determining who is at fault for an interstate chain crash or a massive pileup is always very difficult.  Generally, the rule is that the vehicle who rear ends another vehicle will almost always be liable.  There are exceptions, but that is the general rule and a good place to start in the analysis of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">pileup car accident</a>.</p><p>While it is also obvious to say that the first few cases who may have “started” the pileup may be liable, other vehicles in the back of the pack may also be liable for not stopping in time.  In fact, every vehicle may be liable to the next vehicle in front of it that they hit for negligence.  This is why massive pileups can be a nightmare and require strong counsel to represent your interests to ensure you get the compensation you deserve, especially with a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">large trucking accident</a>.</p><p>In smaller chain crashes, liability is generally placed on the first or final vehicle.  Again, when it comes to any pileup, the general rule is that the rear ending vehicle will be negligence.  For instance, take these examples using three cars:</p><p><i>Example 1</i>: The first car stops, the second car stops, and the third car rear ends the second car and pushes it into the first car.  Because the first and second car were able to stop without difficulty, the third car will be the cause of the accident and liable.  Even though the second car rear ended the first car, the second car was pushed by the third car—the second car stopped in time and did nothing wrong.</p><p><i>Example 2</i>:<i> </i>The first car stops short for no reason, the second car cannot stop and time and rear ends the first car, the third car can also not stop in time and rear ends the second car.  Here, it is likely the first car will be liable for the entire accident.  Stopping abruptly for no reason is negligent and the proximate cause of the second car rear ended the first, and the third car rear ending the second.  Now, the third car may be liable for not stopping in time before it hit the second car for following too closely.  But that is also not likely in a chain where the first car caused the accident.</p><p><i>Example 3</i>:<i> </i>If the first car stops short, the second car stops just in time, and the third car rear ends the second car and pushes into the first car, the third car will likely be liable for the entire crash.  This is because, even though the first car stopped short, the second car was able to stop in time thus demonstrating that a reasonable person could stop in time.  But the third car failed to do so, and will be liable.</p><p>Sounds complicated?  Think about the scenario if there are five, ten, or even twenty vehicles involved.  Imaging trying to have to dissect who is liable and taking all of the witness accounts.  It is a nightmare!  That is why you should not try to guess about liability yourself, and contact an experienced New Mexico motor vehicle crash attorney instead.</p><p><b>The Caruso Law Offices, P.C.: Fighting for Victims in Interstate Pileup and Chain Crash Accidents</b></p><p> </p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Tragic Accident on US 550 Involving Albuquerque, New Mexico Work Truck Explained by Counsel</b></p><p>In a split second, <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1003917/men-in-fatal-crash-admit-drinking.html">an entire family was killed in a New Mexico trucking accident</a>.  On May 12, 2017, a family of four was in an SUV on US 550, a fast-moving highway in New Mexico.  In a work truck coming in the other direction, four men were leaving a job in Albuquerque, New Mexico after doing a landscaping job.  The work truck drifted into the oncoming lane, striking head-on the family of four in the SUV.  It resulted in a large, fiery explosion.  All four in the SUV were killed—a retired firefighter, stay-at-home-mom, and two children aged 4 and 2 and a half years old. The driver of the work truck also died, and the three other in his vehicle were seriously injured.</p><p><a href="http://www.koat.com/article/what-we-know-about-fiery-crash-that-killed-family-of-four/9657823">According to the survivors in the work truck</a>, they admitted to drinking prior to the collision.  While the deceased driver’s toxicology report has not been completed yet, the survivors claim they did drink prior to the collision.  The deceased driver had previously been charged with DWI, but the charges were twice dismissed.  It appears likely that alcohol contributed to this accident.</p><p><b>An All Too Common Fact Pattern: Pieces of a Deadly Puzzle Explained</b></p><p>Unfortunately, alcohol is a common cause of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico motor vehicle accidents</a>.  This has been a major problem throughout the United States for years, and it is one of the most preventable types of motor vehicle accidents.</p><p>Interstates and highways like I-40, I-25, I-10, and US 550 are all very fast moving roads.  This means that drivers have less time to react and their vehicle require more distance to stop.  This is a dangerous combination, especially with large commercial trucks like big rigs, 18 wheelers, tankers, tandem trailers, flatbeds, tractor trailers, and other large trucks.</p><p>Fires and explosions is a dangerous element in highway collisions.  In very serious motor vehicle accidents, especially on the highway, a gas tank may be ruptured and result in a large explosion and fire.  Out in remote parts of the highways or interstates, this can be catastrophic as it may take first responders a significant amount of time to get to the accident scene to rescue victims and put out the fire.</p><p><a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Large commercial trucks are also deadly</a>, even when operated in a reasonably safe manner.  IN this case, there was a piece of equipment on a bed behind the work truck.  This makes the vehicle heavier and harder to maneuver and stop.  This also gives the work truck much more momentum and force behind it, making a head on collisions particularly deadly.</p><p><b>Fiery, Highway, Truck Accidents Require the Representation of Zealous New Mexico Trucking Accident Attorneys Such As the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When a Co-Driver in a Truck is Injured by the Driver in a New Mexico Trucking Crash, He or She May Be Entitled to Compensation</b></p><p>Some of the largest trucking companies use New Mexico’s busy interstates to transport cargo throughout the United States.  Indeed, companies such as US Parcel, Schneider, and FedEx us I-40, I-25, and I-10 to ship goods north and south, and east and west, through New Mexico and to different ends of the country.  In long and large shipping deliveries, trucking companies may use two drivers to help transport their goods in a faster timetable.  This allows one driver to sleep and rest in the cabin while another driver focuses on the road.  Then they can switch when the hours of operation regulations require rest.</p><p>While this can be a safe practice, unfortunately sometimes it is not.  The sleeping driver is completely at the whim of another truck driver and defenseless to any negligence.  Large commercial trucks such as big rigs, tankers, 18 wheelers, tandem trailers, tractor trailers, and other large trucks are always very dangerous.  A sleeping driver could be involved in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious trucking accident and never wake up</a>.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys</a> know how devastating it can be for a loved one to perish in a catastrophic trucking crash.  We have the experience and knowledge necessary to zealously represent a victim and his or her family to ensure they get the maximum compensation they deserve.  Call us today by dialing (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation.  We represent many drivers in Ontario, Upland, and the surrounding area in serious trucking accidents which they did not cause, and we help them receive the compensation they deserve.</p><p><b>Rights of a Sleeping Co-Pilot in a Trucking Collision</b></p><p>When another driver is sleeping in the cabin while a coworker drives and causes a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">serious New Mexico trucking accident</a>, the sleeping driver can easily be seriously injured.  The sleeping driver is not doing anything wrong and cannot be liable for the accident.  Thus, he or she has rights to compensation against the negligent part.</p><p><b>If the negligent party is the other truck driver</b> – When the co-driver is the negligent party, the sleeping driver will have rights to commence a lawsuit against the negligent co-worker and his employer.  However, this is <i>only</i> where the employer does not comply with New Mexico Workers’ Compensation Act which requires an employer to carry workers’ compensation insurance.  If an employer does NOT comply with the Workers’ Compensation Act, an injured driver can commence and action.  Otherwise, it is unlikely an employee will be able to sue an employer.  However, it should be noted that if the employee is really an independent contractor and not an employee, the injured employee CAN sue!</p><p><b>If the negligent party is another driver</b> – When the co-driver is not the negligent party but rather another driver on the roadway causes the <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">serious New Mexico trucking accident</a>, the sleeping driver can commence a personal injury lawsuit against the other driver.  The other driver will likely commence a third party action against your co-driver, employer, and even you, but that may have little effect on your recovery.</p><p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents Injuring or Killing Co-Drivers</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Wrongful Deaths Due to a Truck Driver’s Negligence Can Result in Compensation for the Family of the Loved One Lost</b></p><p>Commercial trucks such as big rigs, 18 wheelers, tandem trailers, tractor trailers, tankers, flatbeds, and other large vehicles can be very dangerous and deadly when the driver behind the wheel is negligent.  New Mexico has some of the busiest trucking routes in the country, including interstate 10, interstate 40, and intestate 25.  Some of the largest trucking companies in the United States, including Schneider, FedEx, Swift, Estes, and other carriers use these routes throughout New Mexico.  Many of these truckers live in many places across the country, including in Ontario, CA and the surrounding area.</p><p>Unfortunately, even if you are a safe driver, another driver may not be.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com">experienced lawyers at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> know that very careful truck drivers driving through New Mexico can be injured by other truck drivers who are not as careful, as experienced, and as well trained for the large commercial vehicle they are driving.  This can result in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/practice-areas/trucking-accident-overview/fatal-truck-accidents/">catastrophic truck crashes resulting in the wrongful death of a victim</a>.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed in a New Mexico trucking crash caused by a truck driver, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Trucking Crashes Causing Wrongful Deaths</b></p><p>Large commercial trucks are the most dangerous vehicles on the road.  They are big, move fast, have many blindspots, and can generate a lot of force.  This means they are more likely to cause a wrongful death when they are involved in a trucking crash.</p><p>Families of the loved one killed in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a> can bring what is known as a wrongful death lawsuit.  A wrongful death lawsuit is meant to compensation the family for the loss of their loved one’s contributions to the family, including love and affection, income, dependency, and other services.  A <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death lawsuit</a> is also meant to punish the negligent defendant for causing such injuries.  The pain and suffering of the loved one may also be compensation in a wrongful death lawsuit.</p><p><b>Wrongful Death Caused in New Mexico of an Out-of-State Driver</b></p><p>Unfortunately, it is a very common scenario where a truck driver kisses his or her family goodbye to go to work driving across America and never comes home because he or she is killed in a trucking accident in another state.  New Mexico is a common place for this fatal scenario to play out, because the interstates in New Mexico help transfer trucking routes north to south or east to west.</p><p>When an <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">out-of-state driver is killed in New Mexico</a>, he or she will be able to commence a lawsuit in New Mexico where the accident occurred.  This if true of his or her family, who may similarly commence an action for wrongful death in New Mexico.</p><p><b>If Your Loved One is Killed in New Mexico in a Trucking Accident, Call us Today!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents Causing Injuries to Truck Drivers by other Truck Drivers Can Result in Compensation</b></p><p>New Mexico has some of the busiest trucking routes throughout the country.  Most of these routes use I-10, I-40, and I-25 to haul cargo north to south, east to west, and vice-versa.  These interstates are very fast and can be congested in several areas, particularly in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Outside of New Mexico, many truck drivers from California in Ontario, Upland, Rancho Cucamonga, and other surrounding areas frequently cut through New Mexico on their way to their final destination.  Most times they can achieve this without incident.</p><p>However, sometimes there are <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">very serious New Mexico truck crashes</a> involving a big rig, tractor trailer, 18 wheeler, semi truck, tanker, flatbed, or other large commercial truck can occur on these busy interstates.  When a commercial truck driver from California or another state is injured in a truck crash in New Mexico by another truck driver, he or she may have rights to compensation due to the negligence of the other driver.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we represent several victims who reside out-of-state and are involved in serious trucking accidents occurring in New Mexico.  Many of these victims are drivers of large commercial trucks who are injured by other truck drivers.  Truck verse truck crashes can be very serious, and our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorney</a> know that these collisions can result in debilitating, permanent, and life-threatening injuries.  Call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Causes of Truck on Truck Crashes on New Mexico Interstates</b></p><p>As with any type of motor vehicle accident, there are many different causes of trucking accidents.  Almost all of these causes are avoidable and preventable by exercising a duty of reasonable care.  This means that a truck driver can avoid causing injuries to other truck drivers if he or she drivers carefully and as he or she is expected to drive on public roads.</p><p>However, we all know this does not occur.  And when two trucks collide on the interstate, the devastation and be absolutely catastrophic.  These are two massive vehicles traveling at a high rate of speed.  This is why many accidents caused by negligence can be compensated.</p><p>Recognizing a type of truck accident which is caused by negligence is very important to know whether you or a loved one have a claim.  Some common causes include the following:</p><p>Failing to yield;</p><p>Driving too fast or speeding;</p><p>Failing to merge properly;</p><p>Not using turning signals;</p><p>Failing to stop at a red light or stop sign;</p><p>Mechanical error such as faulty brakes, broken steering column, or tire blowouts;</p><p>Distracted driving;</p><p>Drunk driving;</p><p>Drugged driving;</p><p>Failing to use emergency flashers after an accident or when disabled;</p><p>Driving too fast for the conditions, such as during a dust storm; and</p><p>Many other causes.</p><p><b>Common Injuries in a Truck versus Truck Collision on a New Mexico Interstate</b></p><p>Since big rigs, trailers, tandem trailers, and other large commercial trucks are big, heavy, and moving fast, they can cause serous personal injuries very easily.  Some common personal injuries caused in a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking crash</a> include the following:</p><p>Broken bones;</p><p>Ruptured or injured organs;</p><p>Nerve injuries or damage;</p><p>Back injuries;</p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries</a>;</p><p>Crushing injuries;</p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Spinal cord injuries</a>;</p><p>Severe lacerations;</p><p>Amputations;</p><p>Loss of eyesight;</p><p>Paralysis;</p><p>Wrongful death; and</p><p>Many other serious causes.</p><p><b>If You Have Been Involved in a New Mexico Trucking Collision and Live Out of State, Call Us Today to Learn What Your Rights are to Compensation!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Night Driving Carries Different Risks and is More Likely to Cause a New Mexico Motor Vehicle Accident</b></p><p>We all know that driving at night is more difficult than driving during the day because it carries different risks.  The most obvious risk is visibility.  Without the sunlight, it is harder to see other vehicles, pedestrians, the roadway, and other hazards on or around the road.  Driving safely and complying with your duty of care in driving is to see what there is to be seen, and failing to do so can result in negligence and serious personal injuries or even wrongful death.</p><p>This is why <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-3/part-9/section-66-3-802/">NM Stat. 66-3-802</a> requires all motor vehicles to use headlamps half an hour after sunset and half an hour before sunrise.  This section of law also requires drivers to use lights “when there is not sufficient light to render clearly discernible persons or vehicle on the highway at a distance of five hundred feet.”  This applies to all motor vehicles, from cars and motorcycles to large commercial trucks or tankers.</p><p>When a vehicle is disabled on the roadway when this section of law requiring headlights to be on, according to <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-3/part-9/section-66-3-853/">NM Stat. 66-3-853</a> the disabled vehicle also needs to use emergency flashers and either a lighted fusee, lighted red electric lantern, or a red emergency reflector one hundred feet behind their vehicle and ahead of their vehicle (for oncoming vehicles), and again not less than 10 feet to the front or  rear of their vehicle.</p><p>Disabled commercial motor vehicles such as large tractor trailers, big rigs, 18-wheelers, tankers, flatbeds, tandem trailers, and other large trucks also need to use emergency flashers under federal regulations pursuant to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/392.22">49 CFR 392.22</a>.  The type and placement is similar to the New Mexico statute.  The goal is to prevent serious personal injuries from <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking crashes</a>.</p><p><b>Common Causes of New Mexico Crashes During the Night</b></p><p>Because of decreased visibility, there are more <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">common causes of accidents</a> involving disability and sight.  These include the following causes of accidents:</p><ul><li>Failure to yield;</li><li>Failure to have headlights on;</li><li>Failure to use emergency flashers for disabled vehicle;</li><li>Broken headlight;</li><li>Dim or improperly covered headlights;</li><li>Failure to use emergency warning signs after disabled;</li><li>Failure to stop at a stop sign or red light;</li><li>Improper merge;</li><li>Unsafe left turn;</li><li>Crashes at exits or entrance ramps to the highway or interstate, such as I-40, I-10, and I-25;</li><li>Collisions with animals at night;</li><li>Pedestrian knockdowns at night;</li><li>Distracted driving;</li><li>Failure to follow signage; and</li><li>Other common causes of traffic accidents.</li></ul><p><b>New Mexico Law Requires Vehicles to be Visible, a Failure of Which Can Result in Serious New Mexico Accidents Causing Permanent Disability or Wrongful Death</b></p><p>Motor vehicle accidents caused at night without headlights or due to these causes may result in liability, and an injured victim should call for experienced legal counsel.  If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Victims of New Mexico Motor Vehicle Accidents Have Three Years to Commence a Lawsuit Under the Statute of Limitations</b></p><p>While a victim of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious New Mexico motor vehicle crash</a> should be focusing on his or her recovery, there is a time limit that he or she will have to commence a lawsuit.  This is true in every state throughout the country.  This time limit is the period in which the person must start a lawsuit after the injury-causing event occurred.  This period is known as the statute of limitations period, and it can completely bar your case if you do not follow it.</p><p>The statute of limitations period is different for every offense, and varies from state to state.  If a victim fails to commence an action within the statute of limitations period, there is no way to revive the claim—even the most sympathetic of judges cannot resurrect your case.  It is the single most important part of your case, and most people have never even heard of it.</p><p>The purpose of the statute of limitations period is to prevent “stale claims.”  Meaning, it is to prevent people from coming back years after an incident to make claims.  The longer away from the time of the accident, the worse a witness’ memory will be, the less physical data there will be, and the less likely that evidence is retained.  Thus, the statute of limitations period facilities an expeditious resolution after an incident to make sure the evidence is fresh and available.</p><p><b>The Statute of Limitations Period for Motor Vehicle Crash Victims</b></p><p>People hurt in New Mexico motor vehicle crashes may have been in <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accidents</a>, car crashes, <a href="https://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motorcycle collisions</a>, SUV rollovers, or other serious incidents.  These types of injuries can cause very serious injuries and even the wrongful death of a victim.  It is important to commence a lawsuit on time and within the statute of limitations period to ensure a victim’s rights are preserved.</p><p>Under New Mexico law, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter37/article1/section37-1-8">NM Stat. 37-1-8</a> provides that an action for damages caused by an injury to the person is three years.  This means that an accident victim must start a lawsuit within three years from the date of the accident.  This is not the date of the injuries, or the date the person realizes there may be a lawsuit.  But this is three years from the date of the act or omission causing the serious injuries.  This applies to car accidents, motorcycle crashes, and <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking crashes</a> all the same.</p><p><b>Is There a Way Around the Statute of Limitations?</b></p><p>There are very few ways to extend the statute of limitations.  The extensions are really known as tolls, or temporary pauses preventing the statute of limitations from running.  The most common is infancy, which is when an infant is injured in a motor vehicle accident.  The statute of limitations will toll while the child is a minor.</p><p>Another toll is disability or incompetence.  Another is where the victim is serious injured and unconscious, thus physically unable to commence the lawsuit.  This can help extend a time to commence a lawsuit, but it should not be relied on and best practice is to always commence an action within the three year time period.</p><p><b>Commencing a New Mexico Motor Vehicle Crash Case Most be Done on Time, and by Good Attorneys</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Drugged Driving is More Likely the Cause of a New Mexico Motor Vehicle Accident Than Drunk Driving, According to New Study</b></p><p>We all know that drunk driving is a very serious danger to people on or new the roads.  But according to a new study and report, “drugged driving,” or driving while under the influence of drugs, is more common than drunk driving.  The report studied the deaths of motorists in motor vehicle accidents throughout the country, and found that 43% of deceased motorists had drugs in their system.  Whereas 38% of deceased motorists had alcohol in their system.  This is the first time that drugged driving was found to be more prevalent than drunk driving.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know that driving under the influence of anything is incredibly dangerous for all on or near the roadway.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> have represented victims of serious and fatal motor vehicle accidents caused by intoxicated drivers on both drugs or alcohol.  Call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Drugged Driving or Drunk Driving is Against the Law in New Mexico</b></p><p>Under New Mexico law, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter66/article8/section66-8-102">NM Stat. 66-8-102</a> makes it “unlawful for a person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor to drive a vehicle within this state.”  It is further “illegal for a person who is under the influence of any drug to a degree that renders the person incapable of safety driving a vehicle to drive a vehicle in this state.”  Violating this statute and causing a motor vehicle accident will render a defendant negligent per se, or automatically negligent for the violation of the statute.</p><p>Additionally, under the common law, or judge-made law, driving while ability impaired by drugs or alcohol and causing a motor vehicle accident is also negligent.  This is because drivers owe a duty of care to others on or near the roadway to drive sober.  When a driver breaches that duty and drives while under the influence of drugs or alcohol and causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a>, he or she will be found negligent.</p><p><b>Truck Drivers are Likely to Use Drugs While Driving and Cause New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>With trucking, time is money.  The faster a shipment can be made, the faster a trucking company and truck driver can make money.  This almost coerces truck drivers into cheating sleep to drive more and deliver more to make more money.  Many truck drivers, unfortunately, turn to controlled substances and drugs to help them stay awake.  Infamously would be speed or cocaine, which are stimulants.</p><p>However, the FCMSA has regulations which apply throughout the United States and prohibit this conduct.  Under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.392#se49.5.392_14">section 392.4,</a> no driver is permitted to operate a commercial vehicle while in possession of or under the influence of certain drugs, kindling speed and cocaine, as well as any other drug which may render a driver incapable of safely operating a commercial vehicle.<br> Additionally, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.392#se49.5.392_15">section 392.5</a> prohibits the use of alcohol while operating a motor vehicle or being under the influence of alcohol.</p><p>As noted above, violations here are against the common law.  A violation of the regulation which causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a> is not automatically negligence like the violation of a statute, but it is evidence of negligence which can help prove your case.</p><p><b>Drugged Driving and Drunk Driving Cause New Mexico Trucking Accidents, and Are Dangerous!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Children Harmed in New Mexico Trucking Accidents Can Suffer Serious and Permanent Injuries Which Affect his or her Whole Life</b></p><p>Children are precious.  They are also some of the most vulnerable members of our society.  This is particularly true of infants and the younger the child is.  This is not just because of their ability to care for themselves, but also because their bodies are growing.  Injuries to a growing person, such as an injury to an organ, growth plate, or to the brain, can result in very serious and permanent injuries.  These can affect a child’s entire development.</p><p>When these injuries are caused due to the <a href="https://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">negligence of a defendant</a>, such as a truck driver, it can cause strong emotions such as frustration or even anger.  Injuries to children can also create emotional, physical, and financial burdens on the child and the entire family.  These can completely flip over an entire family’s way of life.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> know how devastating a trucking accident can be to a young child.  We have handled many trucking accident cases and know how to fight for the rights of young victims harmed by large commercial trucking companies such as FedEx, McLane, and J.B. Hunt.  Call us today for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help lift those burdens off of your family’s shoulders and place them on ours.  We will help you focus on recovering while we fight for your rights.</p><p><b>Valuing a Child’s Injury in a New Mexico Trucking Accident</b></p><p>Valuing the injuries to an infant or child after a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a> is a very difficult process that not every lawyer is equipped to do.  Generally, several different types of experts are needed to help evaluate the injury child and the injuries.  Some of the most common experts and the types of cases they are needed on is the following:</p><p> </p><p>Neurologist – required for any <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">brain injury</a> case, but also any nerve injury case, <a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">spinal cord injury case</a>, or other spine or head injury case.  Psychological or emotional injuries will also require a neurological report, which is also required to help prove them.</p><p> </p><p>Orthopedic expert – in the case of broken bones, especially to major bones like those in the arm, leg, spine, or head, an orthopedist is required to help prove your damages.  When the broken bones are among growth plates, an expert is required to opine as to the effect of the fracture on the development of the bone.</p><p> </p><p>Life care planner – in the event that an infant or child is so severely injured he or she will no longer be able to care for himself or herself, a life care planner is needed to evaluate and explain what the treatment plans are, what the costs of these plans are, and how they will evolve as the child gets older.  This includes calculating the costs of care and the potential for raising costs.  It includes all future doctor’s visits, treatment, surgeries, medications, home health equipment, and related expenses.</p><p> </p><p>Economist – if it is possible for the child to not be able to work, or not be able to do a certain type of work, an economist can be used to help calculate the lost future earnings.  With a young child not yet in the work force, this is very difficult to calculate and usually involves a formula of the parent’s income and the other siblings.  There is no exact science, but a persuasive argument.  The life expectancy of the child is also needed to help calculate this.</p><p><b>Reasons Why New Mexico Trucking Accidents Cause Serious Damages to Infants and Children</b></p><p>Large commercial trucks are just that—large.  They are heavy and on interstates such as I-10, I-25, and I-40 they move very fast.  The potential for a very serious and catastrophic collision is real.  An infant or child’s small body is easily crushed or damaged in these types of high speed collisions.  This is particularly true of organ injuries, where a young child does not have the benefit of a fully-hardened and protective rib cage.  Even though a child’s bones are more flexible, that does not always mean it is a benefit in these types of traumatic collisions.</p><p>Further, infant and young children may be unable to assist themselves out of a trucking accident wreck.  This means they may get stuck in a wreck and sustain addition damages, such as fire or chemical burns.  Large commercial trucks are indiscriminate, and will cause serious damage to whatever human body it collides with.</p><p><b>Representing Children Injured in New Mexico Trucking Accidents is What We Do at Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Defective Equipment Can Cause Serious New Mexico Interstate Trucking Accidents: Three Common Causes to Know</b></p><p>Large commercial trucks are always dangerous.  At any speed and on any road.  However, they are most dangerous on interstates such as I-10, I-25, or I-40.  These are some of the busiest interstates in the entire country used by some of the largest trucking companies such as Estes, Schneider, and FedEx.  Everything on the truck must be in excellent condition while traveling on an interstate, otherwise a part prone to fail <i>will</i> fail and it <i>will</i> cause serious personal injuries or death.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> know that there are many causes of <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">interstate trucking accidents</a> which result from mechanical defects rather than driver error.  Nonetheless, the truck driver and trucking company will still be liable if these defects result in the serious personal injuries of a victim.  Find out how we can help protect your rights by dialing (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation.</p><p><b>Three Common Causes of Technical Defects Which Cause New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>There are many different causes of <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico interstate trucking accidents</a>.  But mechanically speaking, there are three common defects which you need to be aware of.  These generally are caused by the negligence of the trucking company or truck driver, and can help prove your case to get you compensation for your injuries.  These three causes include the following:</p><p>1). Faulty brakes – whether the brake pads are not properly maintained, the brake lines are worn, or the mechanical parts are defective, non-functioning brakes are a serious problem which can result in serious trucking accidents.  These can easily cause personal injuries or death of a victim as the full force and momentum of a large commercial truck could continue forward without slowing.  Faulty brakes are almost always avoidable with the proper inspection, and drivers should be inspecting their brakes regularly.</p><p>2). Defective tires – large commercial trucks have something most other vehicles do not have—lots of tires!  While this is to help balance the trailer and support the large cargo, this is also to help maneuver the truck, increase its friction, and increase its ability to pull forward.  But even just one defective tire can completely unbalance a truck, especially at high speeds on an interstates.  Moreover, a defective tire can also fling debris at other vehicles on the interstate moving at fast speeds.  This can great both obstacles on the road and dangerous rubber missiles on the road.</p><p>3) Broken steering column/wheel – the ability to steer any vehicle is crucial in the safe operation of the vehicle.  This is especially true for a large commercial truck traveling at over 75 MPH on an interstate.  A broken steering column or wheel is something that occurs due to improper or non-existent maintenance.  Regular care and upkeep of a truck will prevent any such defect, but neglect will easily result in the dangerous wear and tear on a steering column.</p><p><b>New Mexico Interstate Trucking Accidents Resulting from These Three Common Causes can Result in Liability</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents Involving Parked or Disabled Trucks on the Side of the Road: Who is Liable and Can you Sue Them?</b></p><p>We know that, generally, when you hit a parked car you are most likely going to be liable.  This even includes of the car is double parked or at a blindspot because, after all, you are the one operating your vehicle.  In general, this is a good rule and puts the burden on motorists to avoid hitting parked vehicles.  It just makes some sense, even though it can be frustrating when that parked vehicle is in such a bad spot that it almost causes the accident.</p><p>While this is the general rule, it is not always the applicable rule.  And one situation when it is different is a large commercial truck such as a big rib, tandem trailer, tanker, flatbed, 18 wheeler, or other large truck.  This is because a truck parked on the side of the road is a very dangerous hazard and much larger than any other vehicle that could be parked.  On highways and interstates these large, parked trucks can actually be a very serious trap for motorists and result in devastating injuries from a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a>.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> know that these types of trucking accidents can be frustrating for other motorists because a parked truck can be almost like a landmine on the side of the highway.  The law requires trucks to take certain precautions to minimize the potential damage they can cause, and when they do not, they may be liable for injuring victims.  If you or a loved one have been <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">seriously injured or killed in a New Mexico trucking accident</a> caused by a disabled or parked truck, call us today by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights.  The telephone call and initial consultation is FREE, and you will only pay us if we win your case, so call today!</p><p><b>Federal Regulations Require Large Commercial Trucks on the Side of the Road to Alert Other Drivers of Their Presence</b></p><p>You may be thinking, who hits a parked car?  How can it happen?  And who would actually sue?</p><p>Unfortunately, it is all too common that vehicles on fact-moving roadways like I-40, I-25, and I-10 can strike large commercial trucks on the roadway.  Sometimes these trucks breakdown right in the center lane of traffic moving 75 MPH or more.  Other times they choose spots on the shoulder but stick out too far impeding on the neighboring lane.  These are dangerous spots.</p><p>This is why <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/392.22">federal regulations impose special rules on commercial trucks</a>. For instance, a stopped commercial truck on the roadway must immediately turn on their emergency flashers to alert all other vehicles.  Additionally, stopped commercial trucks must also place warning devices such as cones on the roadway behind the truck and even in front of the truck to warn oncoming traffic.</p><p>If a driver does not see the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">large commercial truck and crashes</a> into it on the side of the roadway because the truck did not set out warning devices or use its flashers, the victim can recover compensation for the truck’s violation of the federal regulations.  This is known as the doctrine of negligence per se, and is evidence of negligence based on the violation.  This is important because you can really help prove your case just on the rule violation.</p><p><b>Trucks Must Use Emergency Flashers and Warning Devices to Avoid New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Car Accidents Increased During Holiday Weekends Because of Alcohol</b></p><p>Easter weekend is a very religious time and not normally associated with alcohol consumption, but it is still a weekend where people get together and celebrate, catch up, and enjoy food and drink.  It is inevitable that alcohol will be consumed, and even during the day at Easter brunches with family.  This means people may be operating their motor vehicle intoxicated during the peak hours of the day.  With the increased holiday travel due to people commuting, thus putting more people on the roadway, this is a recipe for a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious New Mexico car accident</a> caused by alcohol.</p><p>Here at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C., we understand that victims of a New Mexico car accident caused by alcohol are going to be frustrated with the other driver’s extreme negligence.  We know many drunk driving accidents result in serious personal injuries and even the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death of victims</a>, while most drunk drivers seem to always walk away without a scratch.  If you or a loved one have been serious injured due to a drunk driver, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation and ensure you get the maximum amount you deserve.</p><p><b>Drunk Driving is Not Only Dangerous, but it is Illegal</b></p><p>Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-8/part-2/section-66-8-102/">NM Stat. 66-8-102</a>, it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol under these conditions:</p><ul><li>if you are driving a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/">commercial vehicle like a tractor trailer</a>, it is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration of .04 or more;</li><li>if you are under 21 years old, it is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration of .02 or more; and</li><li>if you are over 21 years old, it is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration of .08.</li></ul><p>It is also illegal under the common law, or judge-made law, which finds that a driver who operates a motor vehicle with an impaired ability due to intoxication may be liable for the damages he or she proximately causes.  This is because each driver must operate his or her vehicle as a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances as another driver, which includes not causing personal injuries due to collisions.</p><p>Where a motorist violates the New Mexico statute, he or she is likely to be negligent per se which means he will be found to be automatically negligent.  This helps an injured victim prove liability and win the case.</p><p><b>Truck Drivers Can Also Not Have Any Alcohol, but May be Impaired</b></p><p><a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> can be caused by alcohol too.  This is because truck drivers may be away from family and friends, causing some depression, and decide to drink before or even during their shift.  Since Easter is on a Sunday, some other truck drivers may even drink excessive on Sunday and not be legally allowed to drive on Monday when they return back to work.  They may not only be still intoxicated, but also too close to their service hours.</p><p>This is governed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.382#se49.5.382_1201">regulations as provided for in this link</a>.  While a violation of one of these federal regulations is not automatically negligence, it is evidence of negligence which you can use to help prove your case.  Coupled with the New Mexico statutes, a truck driver who causes a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a> will very likely be liable for the accident.</p><p><b>Alcohol related Easter Accidents Can Result in Serious Injuries and Wrongful Death</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

TITLE: Inexperienced Truck Driver Causes New Mexico Trucking Accident: Can the Trucking Company be Liable?

CATEGORY:

BODY:
<p><b>When Inexperienced and Poorly Trained Truck Drivers Cause New Mexico Trucking Accidents, the Trucking Company Can Be Liable For Your Damages</b></p><p>All drivers need to pass driver’s education before they can get behind the wheel.  This is an instructional class usually taught during high school to assist people in learning the rules of the road and how to operate a motor vehicle.  After passing this class, an individual takes a driving test.  Almost all of us have been through this process.  The real learning, however, begins as we start driving and gaining experience.  After all, just because we have a license does not mean we are an experience and competent driver, just that we have satisfied the license requirements set forth by the state.</p><p>For commercial truck drivers, they need to pass an additional CDL test.  This also involves classroom instruction, book reading, and another test with a large commercial truck.  After the test, a driver will have his or her CDL.  Again, the real learning begins when a driver starts to operate on the road.  Similarly, a truck driver who just receives his or her license is not necessarily an experienced and competent driver.</p><p>But when you operate a large commercial vehicle such as a tractor trailer, tandem trailer, tanker, flatbed, big rig, 18-wheeler, or other truck, you need to exercise the utmost amount of caution and safety to avoid causing a trucking accident.  These large vehicles are unforgiving, and even a small bumper tap can cause serious personal injuries to the occupants in a passenger vehicle.</p><p>This is why trucking companies are required to train and monitor their employees—their truck drivers.  The trucking companies need to ensure that the truck drivers are getting experience, being taught safe practices, and not being put in positions where they could unnecessarily cause harm to another.  And when their truck drivers get into a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, they can be liable.</p><p><b>Respondeat Superior: Holding Trucking Companies Responsible for Negligent Truck Drivers</b></p><p>When a truck driver causes a serious <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, he or she may not have the financial resources to pay the victim for his or her injuries.  Even with personal car insurance, the individual truck driver will likely not be able to pay the hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage to a victim’s body.  And it may not be fair to require the negligent truck driver to do so anyway, because he or she was operating under the scope of his or her employer.  Meaning, but for the truck driver requiring the truck driver to make the delivery, the truck driver may not have been doing what he or she was doing when the accident occurred.</p><p>This is why a trucking company will be liable for a negligent truck driver.  First, under policy reasons, it makes sense because the trucking company is in a much better position to compensate the victim.  Trucking companies are even required to get insurance policies in the millions to cover <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.</p><p>Second, the trucking company is directing the truck driver to do something for the company.  While the trucking company is not telling the truck driver to be negligent, the trucking company is putting the truck driver in a situation where an accident could happen and someone could get hurt.  To this extent, the trucking company is receiving a benefit for the truck driver’s work, and the truck driver is advancing the company.</p><p>Third, the trucking company is entrusting the truck driver with its cargo and equipment.  In this case, the equipment is a massive vehicle traveling at a high speed.  This is easily a deadly piece of equipment and is dangerous to give away to just anyone.  This is why a trucking company must ensure the truck driver is experienced and well-trained.</p><p>Therefore, New Mexico common law, or judge-made law, has what is known as the respondeat superior doctrine.  In fact, this doctrine is a national one in that the main principle is adopted by every jurisdiction in the United States to one degree or another.  Each state has its own tweaks and distinctions, but the overarching principle is the same.</p><p><b>Defining Respondeat Superior</b></p><p>Respondeat Superior is simply a master-servant relationship.  It mean that the employer will be liable for the acts of an employee committed during the scope of employment.  This type of liability is known as vicarious liability, which simply means that one party will be liable for the acts of another.  This typically happens where there is a confidential relationship between two entities or persons.  A confidential relationship does not mean a relationship that is hidden, but merely a special type of relationship between two entities or persons.</p><p>In terms of an employer and employee relationship, such as a trucking company and a truck driver, there will almost always be the requisite relationship to hold the trucking company liable for the negligent acts of the truck driver caused during the scope of employment.  This means that a victim of a New Mexico trucking accident can receive compensation for his or her injuries.</p><p><b>Inexperienced Truck Drivers Getting Hired to go Behind the Wheel</b></p><p>If a trucking company hires an inexperienced truck driver, it can also be liable for any <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.  This is because a trucking company needs to adequately train and hire competent drivers.  If a trucking company hires bad drivers or poorly trains them, the trucking company can be liable for negligent hiring or supervision and training.</p><p>This is a separate cause of action asserted directly against the trucking company, usually in additional to respondeat superior for the negligent trucking accident.  This can also be a very powerful tool for a victim because it can help establish the negligence of a trucking company when a trucking accident may have facts which hurt the victim’s case, such as bad weather or the victim’s comparative fault.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced New Mexico Trucking Accident Attorney Today to Go After a Trucking Company That Harms

<p><b>New Mexico Interstate Trucking Accidents Cause Serious Injuries Resulting in Hypovolemic Shock: But What is it and Why Does it Happen?</b></p><p>All motor vehicle accidents run the risk of causing hypovolemic shock.  This is particularly true of trucking accidents involving large commercial trucks such as 18-wheelers, tankers, flatbeds, tandem trailers, and other trucks—especially when these <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accidents</a> occur on the highway or interstate such as Interstate 25, Interstate 40, or Interstate 10.</p><p><b>What is Hypovolemic Shock?</b></p><p>Also known as hemorrhagic shock, hypovolemic shock is when an individual loses more than 20 perfect (20%) of his or her body’s blood or fluid supply.  Because of the loss of approximately one-fifth (1/5) of the body’s blood, the pressure is so low that the severe fluid loss makes it impossible for the heart to pump blood throughout your body.</p><p>When this occurs, your body goes into shock and can lead to multiple organ failure.  Essentially, this is when your body has bleed too much and your heart can no longer beat.  This is why it is necessary to get all bleeding under control immediately.</p><p><b>Why Hypovolemic Shock Occurs in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>It should be clear why high-speed <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> can lead to hypovolemic shock.  These collisions result in twisted and splinter steel which can tear right through a body.  If medical attention is not immediately rendered to present excessive bleeding, a victim can quickly succumb to his or her injuries.  While possible in a lot of other situations such as motorcycle accidents or car accidents, interstate trucking accidents are very likely to lead to uncontrollable bleeding.</p><p>Another common reason why hypovolemic shock is common in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> on interstates is because of the lack of medical assistance or delay in getting medical attention.  Many of the serious trucking accidents occur out in stretches of road that do not have immediate access to first responders.  It may take a long time to go and get help or have help arrive.  If there are very serious injuries caused by an interstate trucking accident, it can end up causing fatal injuries.</p><p><b>Uncontrolled Bleeding in New Mexico Trucking Accidents are Common and Result in Wrongful Death Cases</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When Cargo or Unsecured Loads Falls off Trucks on the Interstate, it Can Result in Serious and Fatal New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>There are many different types of large commercial trucks which transport and delivery goods throughout the country.  Some have closed containers, such as tractor trailers, tandem trailers, and tankers.  Others have open contains, such as dump trucks or flatbed trucks.  Many flatbed trucks actually carry oversized loads to help transport cargo throughout the United States.  This is because some cargo cannot fit comfortably or safely inside a container.</p><p>But this also does not necessarily mean that such cargo can safely be transported on the flatbed.  This is particularly true on an interstate where the speed is very fast and the wind resistance is very strong.  While not in a container, cargo must be properly secured to prevent it from falling off onto the road.  The cargo itself could strike or flatten another vehicle.  It could also cause a hazard on the roadway and be deadly.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we have handled many <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> caused by cargo falling, shifting, or crushing victims on the roadway.  Injuries can easily be fatal, especially on interstates where motorists are traveling at a very high speed.  If you or a loved one have been injured from cargo falling off a truck or becoming dangerous debris in the roadway, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accidents attorneys</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will fight for the maximum compensation you may be entitled to.</p><p><b>Causes of Unsecured Cargo Causing Personal Injuries </b></p><p>There are many different causes which can result in unsecured cargo causing serious personal injuries or the death of a victim.  Some of the major causes of <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking accidents on interstates</a> due to unsecured cargo includes the following:</p><ul><li>Cargo improperly secured;</li><li>Too heavy cargo;</li><li>Using improper means to secure cargo;</li><li>Cargo shifting and causing a truck to be unbalanced;</li><li>Excessively heavy cargo causing tire blowouts, explosions, or to fail;</li><li>Too heavy cargo causing brake failures;</li><li>Environmental factors such as gusty winds;</li><li>Excessive speed;</li><li>Braking at the last moment to cause shifting weight; and</li><li>Many other causes.</li></ul><p><b>If Cargo Does Injure You When it Falls, It is a Landmine on the Road!</b></p><p>On New Mexico interstates, when cargo falls off of a fast-moving commercial truck it is like a missile going through the air and onto other vehicles or the roadway.  This can be catastrophic if the cargo connects with a victim’s vehicle.  But if the cargo does not, it can actually be just as dangerous if it sits on the road.  It can be a landmine for vehicles moving at high speeds on New Mexico interstates which can result in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">fatal trucking accidents</a>.</p><p>In fact, this is a way to find a trucking company who drops cargo on the road to be liable.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2016/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-364/">NM Stat 66-7-364</a>, it is illegal to place injurious material or trash on the highway.  This includes anything that is dropped onto the highway which can be destructive or injurious.  This can result in serious personal injuries, and is a way to hold a trucking company liable.</p><p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents Caused by Unsecured Cargo and Injurious Material on the Roadway is Dangerous</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When Roadway Debris Causes New Mexico Motor Vehicle Accidents, Victims Can Still Get Compensated for their Injuries</b></p><p>Not all motor vehicle accidents are solely caused by the negligence of another driver.  Sometimes motor vehicle accidents are caused or contributed to by other factors such as dust storms, rain, snow, or glaring sun.  These are factors that are not the main cause, but can result in difficult driving conditions which contribute to an accident.</p><p>Roadway debris is another type of hazard which can result in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.  Anything around or on the roadway can be a potentially dangerous and even deadly hazard, particularly on the interstate.  Indeed, roadway debris on interstates can result in very serious injuries or death.  Every year some of the largest trucking companies in the United States, including FedEx, Estes, and J.B. Hunt, are involved in trucking accidents caused by roadway debris.</p><p><b>Dangers of Roadway Debris: How They Can Injure or Kill</b></p><p>Roadway debris can cause deadly New Mexico trucking accidents in many different ways.  The most obvious would be for the roadway debris to actually cause the injury.  This could result from striking the roadway debris directly and it causing an injury.  This could also mean the roadway debris was run over by another vehicle and launched into the victim’s vehicle.  Either way, the roadway debris was the mechanism for the injury.</p><p>Another way roadway debris could cause an accident is where another vehicle swerves to avoid it which results in a serious accident.  If a large commercial truck attempt to avoid roadway debris on the interstate, this could result in de-stabilizing the truck causing it to roll over, flip, jackknife, or slide into another lane and another vehicle.  On an interstate, this can result in serious personal injuries or the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">death of a victim</a>.</p><p><b>Liability from Roadway Debris: Who is at Fault?  Who Should Compensate Me?</b></p><p>When a victim is injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico motor vehicle accident</a> caused by roadway debris, there could be many questions as to who is potentially liable for the victim’s injuries.  The most obvious would be whoever hit or struck the victim.  This could be a vehicle avoiding the debris and striking the victim’s vehicle.  This is usually a party that may be liable, unless it is found that the emergency doctrine applies.  However, drivers are required to see what there is to be seen on the roadways and debris is certainly one of the hazards that must be observed and avoided.</p><p>Another liable party is whoever put the debris in the roadway.  That seems obvious when the roadway debris is something such as a construction cone or cargo from a large commercial truck.  In those instances, the construction company (or the State) and the trucking company who owns the cargo would be liable.  But in other instances the roadway debris could be pieces of trees or plants, large rocks, or miscellaneous garage on the side of a roadway.  In that instance, the municipality, county, or even the State may be liable for the roadway debris.</p><p>When in doubt, the best practice is always to commence an action against all possible parties.  During the discovery process the court and the parties will sort through the evidence and decide whether a party is liable or is not liable.</p><p><b>Injuries Caused by Roadway Debris Can be Compensated</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents Causing Serious Injuries to Children</b></p><p>Whether you are an adult or child, a New Mexico trucking accident can cause serious injuries or even death.  This is due to the sheer size, weight, and force in a large commercial truck, particularly tandem trailers, tankers, flatbeds, and other trucks.  Trucking accidents are also more catastrophic on highways and interstates, particularly Interstate 10, Interstate 25, and Interstate 40 which all have high speed limits.  The faster a large truck goes, the more momentum it has, and the more devastating the impact will be.</p><p>To a child, any impact in a vehicle will be significant.  When this is a large commercial truck on an interstate, it is very likely the impact will cause permanent and debilitating injuries, if not the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death, of the child.</a>  If you or someone you know has had a child seriously injured or killed in a New Mexico trucking accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  Our experienced personal injury attorneys have handled many severe trucking accident causes involving children, and we know how to fight for the maximum compensation you and your child may be entitled to.</p><p><b>Common Injuries to Children in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Unfortunately, when a child is a passenger in a New Mexico trucking accident it does not bode well.  Children’s bodies are not developed and are lacking certain features that adult bodies have.  Commonly this is stronger bodies, more muscle, and thicker frames.  This helps “pad” and protect an adult’s body.  Because of these, there are certain injuries which a child will commonly have following a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accident</a>:</p><ul><li>Ruptured or lacerated organs;</li><li>Brain bleeds;</li><li>Fractured bones, particularly ribs, femur, and the humerus;</li><li>Nerve injuries, particularly brachial plexus injuries;</li><li>Injuries to veins or arteries;</li><li>Eye injuries, including optical nerve injuries;</li><li>Mouth and teeth injuries;</li><li>Facial injuries;</li><li>Severe seatbelt injuries;</li><li>Broken knees or ankles;</li><li>Crushing injuries;</li><li>Lacerations during to foreign debris or broken glass;</li><li>Growth plate injuries, particularly to ankles or wrists;</li><li>Wrongful death; and</li><li>Many more similar injuries.</li></ul><p><b>Injuries to Children can be Complicated</b></p><p>When a child is injured in a New Mexico trucking accident, it can also be more difficult to evaluate injuries.  This is partially because children do not always know how to articulate their pains and aches.  This is also due to the fact that children are still growing, and it may be very difficult to assess how the injuries will impact the child’s life and development.  This is particularly true in cases involving broken bones, growth plate injuries, lacerations, and organ injuries.</p><p>Further, children who require future surgery as they get older will also be harder to gauge the amount of compensation they deserve.  Meaning, if a child needs a surgery every 20 years, the child may need to undergo 3-4 surgeries in his or her lifetime.  In the 60 to 80 years this spans, the costs of surgery, the alternatives and likely developments in surgery, and the life expectancy are all variables that need to be addressed.</p><p><b>Children Injured in New Mexico Interstate Trucking Accidents Deserve Dedicated and Compassionate Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Taking Certain Steps After a New Mexico Trucking Accident Can Help Your Case</b></p><p>No one plans to be in a motor vehicle accident, but they happen more often than we would like.  Sometimes these accidents are simple bumper tappers with no issues.  But other times these accidents are very serious collisions and resulting in serious personal injuries.  Unfortunately, these accidents can also cause the <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/practice-areas/trucking-accident-overview/fatal-truck-accidents/">wrongful death of a victim</a>.  There are some steps that everyone should take to protect their rights to compensation following a serious motor vehicle accident.</p><p>Over all motor vehicle accidents, <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">interstate trucking accidents</a> are most likely to cause serious personal injuries and the wrongful death of a victim.  These are daunting cases and require proper attention and legal representation.  Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> have handled some of the most serious interstate trucking accidents in New Mexico, including wrongful death cases.  We have fought some of the <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">largest trucking accident companies in the country, including FedEx</a>, and we won’t back down until you and your family get the compensation you deserve.  Call us today for a FREE consultation to learn how we can help by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>First Steps to Take After a New Mexico Interstate Trucking Accident</b></p><p>In any motor vehicle accident, the first step is to also get medical care and treatment.  Explain everything that hurts and what you believed happened to the healthcare providers.  Do not be a hero—if something hurts bad, tell the providers.  This is not the time to be macho, but to really get all of your injuries treated and recorded in your medical file.  This can help you prove your cases later.</p><p>Also cooperate with first responders such as police, ambulance, and fire staff responding.  Make sure to explain what happened as thorough as you can.  Get business cards and the names and contact number of each individual responding—not just the agency!  You will want to interview these individuals later and having names will help you.</p><p>Take note of your surroundings and environment, particularly the mile markers on the interstate highway shoulders.  Also look for weather it is cloudy, sunny, wet or dry out.  These also help to prove your case.  This includes getting the other party’s name and address, including the trucking company’s name and contact information.</p><p><b>Next Step to Protect Your Rights After a New Mexico Interstate Trucking Accident</b></p><p>It may sound cliche, but contact an attorney immediately.  Why?  Because all large commercial trucks have electronic computers inside them.  These computers monitor nearly everything about a truck.  This information ranges from the basic information such as air temperature or length the vehicle has been driving, to also more complex information such as speed, whether the truck was braking or accelerating, or how the wheel was being turned.</p><p>This information, however, is usually wiped after a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accident</a> by the trucking company.  That is right—completely erased!  But this is not with malicious intent, usually at least, but just that the information gets downloaded by the trucking company and the insurance carrier.  This automatically deletes the information from the computer.  If the trucking company or insurance carrier do not properly download the information, it will be delated and there will be nothing for anyone to use because it was not downloaded properly.</p><p>If you have an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorney</a>, your attorney will immediately move for an injunction or restraining order to keep the other side from removing anything from the truck’s company without your legal representation (and expert) present.  This is essential to do right away, as trucking companies can remove the data within weeks—if not days—of the trucking accident.</p><p><b>Steps to Take After a New Mexico Trucking Accident on an Interstate</b></p><p>The conclusion should be to first get medical treatment, gather information, and then get immediately legal representation.  This will help ensure that your trucking accident case is well-protected.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also

<p><b>New Mexico Rear-end Trucking Accidents on Interstates Can be Fatal: New Mexico Trucking Accident Attorneys Explain Common Causes</b></p><p>Interstate trucking accidents can easily cause the <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/practice-areas/trucking-accident-overview/fatal-truck-accidents/">wrongful death of a loved one</a>.  Large commercial trucks such as big rigs, 18-wheelers, tankers, and other trucks can cause devastating damage with whatever they impact.  One of the most common types of interstate trucking accidents is the rear-end accident.</p><p>This is almost always negligence because <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-318/">NM Stat Section 66-7-318</a> requires under subdivision (A) that “[t]he driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.”  When a rear-end crash occurs, it is almost always a violation of this statute which, under the doctrine of negligence per se, allows a finding of negligence solely because this occurred.</p><p>On the interstate, there are some common causes of <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico rear-end trucking accidents</a> which can entitle a victim to compensation.  These include the following:</p><p><b>Distracted Driving </b></p><p>One of the most common and most preventable causes, distracted driving results in a significant number of New Mexico trucking accidents on the interstate.  Distracted driving includes cell phone use such as texting or phone calls, programming a GPS, changing the radio, or talking to or interacting with passengers.  When it comes to truck drivers, the most common distraction is cell phone use or use of the handheld radio.  When a truck driver causes a wrongful death on an interstate because of distracted driving, it is negligence.</p><p><b>Weather Such as Dust Storms</b></p><p>When serious weather systems move across the state, it can cause havoc on the roadways—particularly the interstates.  One of the worst weather conditions plaguing New Mexico interstate are dust storms. These storms are impossible to guard against and can easily be deadly because of the limited visibility they cause for motorists going at high speeds.  This is particularly dangerous for truck drivers who need to slow down and brake sooner, despite having limited visibility to do so.</p><p>Under common law (judge-made) and federal regulations, truck drivers must slow down until they can safely operate their vehicle otherwise they may cause a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a>.  If they cannot slow down to safely do so they must stop until they can safely resume.  But stopping means wasting time, and time is money for trucking companies.  Many truck drivers continue to go forward anyway which results in rear-ending other vehicles which have properly slowed down given the weather conditions. This is also negligence.</p><p><b>Drowsy Driving or Falling Asleep at the Wheel</b></p><p>Because trucking is a time is money business, the longer a truck driver and operate his or her vehicle the faster he or she can deliver cargo.  Unfortunately, this means neglecting basic needs such as sleeping.  While federal regulations have service of hours requirements, many truck drivers break these rules in order to work longer hours.  This means they are driving while drowsy and at risk of falling asleep at the wheel causing a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious interstate trucking accident</a>.  When they do that, they can rear-end other vehicles on the interstate and do so at full-speed.  These can easily kill victims.</p><p><b>Common Causes of New Mexico Rear-End Trucking Accidents Require Zealous Legal Representation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Trucking Accidents</a> Are More Likely to Kill on Interstates, and Most Likely to Kill on Exit and Entrance Ramps</b></p><p>New Mexico has some of the busiest interstates in the entire country.  Interstate 40 and Interstate 25 cut through Albuquerque, New Mexico, which serves as one of the the largest hubs in the state.  This is also a major port where trucking companies and truck drivers switch from east and west to north and south.  This makes some of the most complicated exit and entrance ramps.  To a lesser degree, Interstate 10 down in Las Cruces, New Mexico also forms a major junction with Interstate 25 again creating a major west and west to north and south switch.  This produces a lot of traffic and a lot of exits and on-ramps.</p><p>One of the most dangerous parts of all interstates and highways are the exit and on-ramps.  This is due to the increased traffic, distracted drivers looking at the signage, and inexperienced drivers unsure where to go.  This is also because of the large commercial trucks from some of the largest trucking carriers in the United States, including Ryder, J.B. Hunt, Estes, and Schneider, among others.  These large commercial trucks coming and going on and off exit and on-ramps can result in devastating trucking accidents.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been serious injured of killed in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> caused on an interstate such as I-10, I-25, or I-40, call our <a href="/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will help fight for your rights to compensation and ensure you get the maximum amount of compensation you may be entitled to.  There is no risk, and you only pay us if we win your case.  <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact us</a> today!</p><p><b>Dangerous of Interstate Exit and On-ramps</b></p><p>Generally, driving on an interstate is pretty easy.  Go straight and stay in your lane.  Other vehicles do the same.  However, exit and on-ramps are different because you are not just going straight or staying in your lane—nor are other people.  People are weaving in and out of lanes to change route.  Truck drivers are some of the biggest offenders, and the biggest danger.</p><p>When these large commercial trucks commit to a lane change, that is it—it is very hard to change.  If that change was improper, it can be deadly for the occupants of passenger vehicles.  Especially on the interstate when all vehicles are traveling at a high speed.  Some common causes of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents on interstate</a> exit and on-ramps include the following:</p><ul><li>Improper lane changes;</li><li>Excessive speed;</li><li>Distracted driving on cell phone, radio, or GPS;</li><li>Reading signage and not paying attention to traffic;</li><li>Fatigued driving;</li><li>Dust storms;</li><li>Nighttime driving;</li><li>Confusing roadways;</li><li>Road rage; and</li><li>Other negligence.</li></ul><p><b>Interstate Trucking Accidents Causing Wrongful Death at Exit Ramps and On-Ramps</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C</a>. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents Occurring on Interstates Can Result in Wrongful Deaths and Serious Injuries</b></p><p>Motor vehicle cases may sound easy to prove and establish.  That is because sometimes they are.  One driver makes a last second left turn.  One fails to stop at a stop sign.  Another fails to yield.  These are common causes of motor vehicle accidents and easy enough to prove.  Proving these cases can get victims the compensation they deserve for their injuries.</p><p>But <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">interstate trucking accident</a> cases are different.  Very different.  That is because there can be many different factors which may cause the accident.  Many times the same type of causes of motor vehicle accidents described above are not relevant to interstate trucking accidents.  Interstates do not have stop signs or yield signs, and there is no threat of a left turn.  Interstate trucking accidents are generally caused by the human element—what action the other driver took.  This means that you cannot point to the basic traffic rules to win your case.  This makes interstate accidents much more difficult.</p><p>And interstate trucking accidents cases are even more difficult, especially when there is a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death</a>.  Unfortunately, most New Mexico interstate trucking accidents result in the wrongful death of a victim because of the shear size of the large commercial truck and the speed at which it is traveling.  This generates a lot of destructive force which can cause catastrophic and life-threatening injuries to a victim.</p><p><b>Beginning to Prove Your Case</b></p><p>After any <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">interstate trucking accident</a>, the first place to start is witness statements and documentary evidence.  Witnesses can help provide information to counsel on where to look, what potential causes were, and who may be at fault.  Witness statements can also help prove your case by simply providing statements.  But sometimes witnesses are not available, particularly if there is a wrongful death.</p><p>In that case, the documentary evidence is crucial.  This includes police reports and police accident reconstructions.  These pieces of evidence are easy to obtain, even if a FOIL request is necessary.  Many times the victim or the victim’s family will already have the documents.</p><p>Medical records are also very important.  While it is rare that the medical records help prove the liability part of your case, unless there are statements to victims that are germane to treatment (i.e., the truck rear-ended me and caused whiplash), any statements by victims as to liability will be precluded by the court anyway.  The reason why medical records are so important are that they establish damages, pain and suffering, medical bills, and other related expenses which can be recovered in a New Mexico trucking accident case occurring on an interstate.</p><p><b>Gathering Records and Evidence from the Truck and Trucking Company</b></p><p>An <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico interstate trucking accident attorney</a> will know where to look to find evidence of negligence in the truck.  Each truck has an onboard computer which can be used to determine the speed, movement, position, whether the driver was braking or accelerating, and other important information.  This can be used to prove the conduct of the defendant truck driver.  This can also be used to determine whether the truck driver has had the proper amount of rest and <a href="https://carusolaw.com/hours-of-service-of-truck-driver-regulations-and-how-it-can-help-win-your-new-mexico-trucking-accident-case/">sleep per the hours of service regulations</a>.</p><p>Truck drivers are also required to keep a logbook.  This logbook can further be used to determine if the truck driver has had the proper amount of rest per the hours of service regulations.  Maintenance books can also be used to determine whether there were any issues with the trucks such as the wheel, brakes, or other safety devices.</p><p><b>Proving Your Case Requires Experienced New Mexico Interstate Trucking Accident Attorneys</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Blowing Dust and Multi-vehicle Pileup Close I-10; Potential for Wrongful Death Avoided</b></p><p>According to <a href="http://www.abc15.com/news/region-central-southern-az/other/adot-closes-interstate-10-near-new-mexico-state-line">news sources</a>, Interstate 10 was closed for over three hours due to blowing dust and multi-vehicle crashes.  The accidents occurred new San Simon, New Mexico and Lordsburg, New Mexico, on I-10 near the border.  Reports came in that blowing dust was so bad and heavy that motorists could barely see just beyond their hood.  Involved in the crashes was a large semi-truck.  Luckily this time no one was seriously hurt.</p><p>However, that is not always the case.  All too often innocent people are seriously injured or killed on these interstates.  I-10 brings many of the largest trucking companies in the country, such as YRC Worldwide, Landstar System, Arcbest, Roadrunner Transportation Services, and Knight Transportation to New Mexico.  Interstate 10 connects with Interstate 25 at Las Cruces, New Mexico, which is an important hub for these large commercial trucking companies to change direction from east and west to north and south.  Because of this combination, there are many wrongful death cases involving <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> have handled many <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death matters</a> occurring on these busy interstates.  We have the experience battling some of the largest trucking companies in the country, <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com/2016/02/leon-family-satisfied-with-fedex.html">including FedEx, and successfully recovering for our clients and their families the compensation they deserve</a>.  Call us today for a FREE consultation to learn how we can help protect your rights to compensation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Dust and New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Dust is one of the most dangerous and deadly contributing factors to <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">commercial trucking accidents</a>.  This is because dust does a few things to make serious trucking accidents causing the death of a victim more likely.</p><p>First, dust reduces visibility.  This makes it harder for all motorists on the roadway to see hazards, such as other vehicles.  This means motorists will see the hazards with less time to react to them.  This makes it more likely that there could be an accident, particularly a rear-end collision.  This is magnified for large commercial trucks, which already need a lot of distance to stop—especially on the interstate.</p><p>Second, dust also deposits debris on the roadway.  Even a little bit of dust on the roadway and greatly reduce the friction between a large commercial truck’s tires and the pavement.  The dust storms can also bring sticks, twigs, and other debris onto the roadway creating future hazards.  This can increases the distance it takes for a large commercial truck to stop.</p><p><b>Wrongful Death Accidents on Interstates Due to Dusts</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

Hunt, Estes, Ryder, and many others use these interstates to get around and through New Mexico.  With some many large commercial trucks traveling at such high speeds, it is no wonder why there are so many wrongful death cases caused by <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking accidents</a>.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our New Mexico wrongful death attorneys</a> have handled many wrongful death cases caused by New Mexico trucking accidents.  We know that speed kills, and interstates collisions involving passenger vehicles and tractor trailers frequently result in the death of the occupants of the passenger vehicle.  We have the experience fighting for the rights of those who have been killed in these types of trucking accidents.  If a loved one has been killed in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 today to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation for the wrongful death of your loved one.</p><p><b>Components of a Wrongful Death Lawsuit</b></p><p>A <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death lawsuit</a> is complicated and requires experienced representation.  The first and most important component of a wrongful death case is to get the family stabilized.  An experienced wrongful death attorney will help answer any questions that a family has and ensure they are taken care of emotionally and financially during the pendency of the litigation.  This includes going to probate court to help the family access accounts and avenues of funds.  This also includes getting permission from the probate court to commence the action by getting authority from the estate, or family and dependents.</p><p>The next most important aspect of a wrongful death lawsuit involves gathering records, including medical records, autopsy records, financial records, and other records pertinent to the lawsuit.  Performing an accident investigation and collecting police records and reports is also important to begin the lawsuit.</p><p>Once the majority of the records have been collected, it is time to commence the lawsuit.  This is where the possibility for settlement comes into consideration.  The lawsuit will continue against the defendant trucking company and truck driver, as represented by their insurance company.  The lawsuit will continue through discovery and ultimately lead to trial.</p><p><b>Role the Family Plays in a Wrongful Death Lawsuit</b></p><p>The role of the family of the decedent in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death lawsuit </a>is very important.  Many times, unfortunately, the family may have witnessed the accident.  This means they are fact witnesses and can help the attorney represent their loved one and prove their case.  The family is also important to help collect evidence and information for the attorney to help support the case.</p><p>A family is also required to help explain to the court and jury what role that their loved one played in the home.  This is how the damages can be assessed and determined because damages are frequently about the economic impact that the wrongful death has on the family.</p><p><b><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Wrongful Deaths</a> Caused by Trucking Accidents on Interstates Require Proper Representation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also <strong><a href="/Contact.shtml">contact us</a></strong> on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Truck Drivers Must Follow the Federal Regulations Governing Hours of Service to Help Prevent Drowsy or Fatigued Driving Accidents</b></p><p>Time is money for trucking businesses.  The faster they can deliver cargo, the faster they can get paid.  The more times they deliver cargo, the more times they get paid.  The less drivers delivering cargo, the less they have to pay in salary and cover health care insurance and motor vehicle insurance.</p><p>This is why many trucking companies and truck drivers take shortcuts in properly delivering the cargo.  Many truck drivers will drive sleep-deprived and on energy drinks or pills to stay awake.  The more they can work the more they get paid and stay in the good graces of their employer.</p><p>But this is just dangerous and can lead to <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.  Large commercial trucks such as semis, tandem trailers tractor trailers, flatbeds, tankers, 18-wheelers, big rigs, and many other trucks can cause a significant amount of damage to anything they collide with.  This means occupants of motor vehicle truck by a tractor trailer can easily be serious injured or killed.  Given that large commercial trucks operate throughout the United States on the interstate highways, it was necessary for the federal government to come in and set guidelines and regulations that apply to all states.  And they did just that to protect all of us.</p><p><b>Federal Regulations by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Make Us Safer with Hours of Service Rules</b></p><p>One of the most important federal regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is the hours of service of drivers requirements in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.395">Part 395 of Title 49 of the CFR</a>.  These regulations restrict the number of hours that a truck driver may drive in a 24 hour period.  The goal is to help reduce fatigued driving which results in <a href="https://carusolaw.com">trucking accidents, including fatal ones</a>.  These regulations also prohibit a trucking company from requiring a truck driver to violate these rules to meet the trucking company’s schedule and goals.</p><p>Some important provisions of the hours of service of driver federal regulations include the following:</p><ul><li>A truck driver may not start a shift without first having 10 consecutive hours of off duty prior to the start;</li><li>During the shift a truck driver may driver only during a period of 14 consecutive hours after coming on duty and may not drive after the end of the 14 consecutive hour period.</li><li>To be eligible to start another shift, the truck driver must again have 10 consecutive hours of off duty prior to the start.</li><li>During the 14 hour shift, a truck driver may only drive a total of 11 hours during the 14 hour period.</li><li>A truck driver may not drive if more than 8 hours have passed since the end of the driver’ last off duty or sleeper-berth (sleeping compartment in cabin of truck) period of at least 30 minutes (rest break required); and</li><li>Several total hour requires per 7 day period depending on status of the company.</li></ul><p>Truck drivers are required to keep a duty status logbook as to how many hours they have slept, rested, and been driving.  This is very important and is how law enforcement can check the logbook to see if the truck driver is company.</p><p>Even though the truck driver has control of the logbook and you may believe it is easier for the truck driver to lie about the hours of service, there are other methods officers can use to establish whether truck drivers are in compliance.</p><p>For instance, there is an electronic logbook system is in the truck’s computer which also keeps track which officers can sometimes access in the field to check.  Officers can also determine where the truck driver left and whether the traffic stop is to determine whether it is possible for the truck driver to have been at that location at the time they claim.</p><p><b>Using Hours of Service Violations in Your New Mexico Trucking Accident Lawsuit</b></p><p>A violation of a regulation is evidence of negligence.  Thus, if a truck driver or trucking company violates the hours of service regulations and causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a> resulting in injuries, the violation can be used to demonstrate evidence of negligent conduct to help prove your case.  This is known as the negligence per se doctrine.</p><p>Your <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorney</a> can use this regulation to help determine the cause of the trucking accident.  Fatigue and drowsiness is difficult to prove unless there is an admission that the truck driver fell asleep at the wheel or if there are logbook discrepancies.</p><p>The federal government set these regulations demonstrating what is reasonable to driver under.  Failing to comply just establishes what is not reasonable to drive as an alert and prudent driver.  These can prove your case and get you the compensation you deserve for your injuries.</p><p><b>Hours of Service Violation Can Win Compensation for Your Injuries </b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Trucking Accident Attorney Explains How High Speed Trucking Accidents in New Mexico Kill Innocent Victims</b></p><p>Trucking accidents occurring at high speed are some of the most deadly accidents possible.  Even worse than accidents such as explosions, fires, or chemical spills.  But most high speed trucking accidents actually do involve explosions, fires, or chemical spills as a result of the collision because many times the large commercial trucks are carrying hazardous materials.  If the initial impact does not kill the victims, the subsequent conditions like fire very well could.</p><p>Here are the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys</a> have handled many high speed collisions occurring on some of the busiest interstates in New Mexico.  We have the knowledge and <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com/2016/02/leon-family-satisfied-with-fedex.html">proven track record of success</a> representing those injured or killed in serious trucking accidents, including accidents resulting in deadly fires.  Call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You only pay us if we win your case!  Learn how we can help you obtain the maximum compensation for your injuries, medical bills, and lost wages today.</p><p><b>High Speed Collisions on Interstates in New Mexico</b></p><p><a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">High speed trucking accidents</a> naturally occur most commonly on highways and interstates.  New Mexico has some of the busiest interstates in the region, if not the country.  These include Interstate 40 and Interstate 25 cutting through Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Interstate 10 cutting through Las Cruces, New Mexico, and the bottom of the state.  Most portions of these interstates are 75 MPH, but most motorists go even faster.</p><p>It is this speed which is the deadly factor in trucking accidents.  Commercial trucks are large and heavy.  This heavy weight becomes like a battering ram in a collision.  It makes large commercial trucks harder to steer, harder to brake, and harder to maneuver or turn.  This is a dangerous combination of factors which can lead to trucking accidents.</p><p>This heavy weight at a high speed also creates more force or momentum.  This means that the large commercial truck needs to slow to stop or disburse to stop this momentum.  If the truck driver cannot stop in time, that means it will have to disburse this momentum.  This transfers the force into whatever the truck hits which could be a passenger vehicle.</p><p>At high speed, passenger vehicles hit by a large commercial truck can be absolutely destroyed.  The energy from the fast-moving truck goes through the passenger vehicle and into the occupants.  This can cause serious personal injuries and easily cause <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">death to all involved in the trucking accident</a>.</p><p><b>High Speed New Mexico Trucking Accidents Causing Death or Serious Injury Need Our Legal Representation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Drowsy Driving is Dangerous and Can Cause Serious Trucking Accidents, Which is Why Federal Regulations Govern a Truck Driver’s Conduct</b></p><p>The trucking business is all about delivering cargo to get paid.  The faster the trucking business delivers cargo, the faster the trucking business gets paid.  The faster the trucking business gets paid, the more the trucking business makes.  Simply put, for trucking businesses time is money.  This means the more shortcuts trucking companies can take to speed up the delivery process, the more money they can make.  The faster a trucking business can deliver goods, the less drivers they need and the more hours they can get out of their drivers.</p><p><b>Trucking Shortcuts Kill</b></p><p>These shortcuts, however, put everyone else on or around the roads at risk for <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accidents</a>.  The most common shortcut is to have a driver work too many hours on the road delivering as much as possible.  This makes the driver sleep-deprived,  fatigued, and dangerous.</p><p>This cannot be more true on the interstates in New Mexico, some of the busiest interstates in the country, where drowsy truck drivers could fall asleep behind the wheel going 75 MPH.  This includes Interstate 40 and Interstate 25 going through Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Interstate 10 going through Las Cruces, New Mexico which is another major hub.  <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Serious personal injuries or wrongful death</a> can easily occur in these types of trucking accidents.</p><p>This is why federal regulations help protect all of us on the roadways from drowsy truck drivers.  These regulations apply to all trucking companies and truck drivers on any roads throughout the Untied States.  These regulations apply in addition to any state-specific regulations or laws which also apply.</p><p><b>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Regulations To Protect Drivers From Drowsy Truck Drivers</b></p><p>In addition to it just being negligent under the common law, the federal regulations help prove an Albuquerque trucking accident victim’s case against a tired and fatigued driver.  A violation of a federal regulation is evidence of negligence and can be used to help proof the victim’s case under the theory of negligence per se in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking accident</a>.</p><p>Specifically, under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.392#se49.5.392_13">49 CFR 392.3</a>, “[n]o driver shall operate a commercial motor vehicle, and a motor carrier shall not require or permit a driver to operate a commercial motor vehicle, while the driver’s ability or alertness is so impaired, or so likely to become impaired, through fatigue, illness, or any other cause, as to make it unsafe for him/her to begin or continue to operate the commercial motor vehicle.”</p><p>This means that both the truck driver AND trucking business are responsible for ensuring that the truck driver is not driving while fatigued.  If a truck driver falls asleep while driving, both will be liable under this regulation if the trucking company knew or should have known the truck driver was fatigued or tired.</p><p><b>When a Truck Driver Falls Asleep Behind the Wheel, a Victim of an Albuquerque Trucking Accident Can Collect Compensation for Injuries or Wrongful Death</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

Hunt, Estes, and Ryder are some of the most common trucks on the roads throughout our country.  Many of these trucking companies whip through New Mexico on some our the busiest interstates in the country, including Interstate 40, Interstate 25, and Interstate 10.  Albuquerque, New Mexico is one of the busiest trucking meccas in New Mexico, as both Interstate 40 and Interstate 25 cut through the city making it an important hub.</p><p>Due to their large size, making large commercial trucks on interstates such as big rigs, 18-wheelers, tankers, flatbeds, tandem trailers, and other large trucks can cause <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">serious injuries in New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.  This is because they are very large and heavy, plus they are moving very fast on the interstates.  This means they can pack a serious punch when they collide with another vehicle—especially a passenger vehicle.</p><p>There are three of the most serious types of personal injuries resulting from New Mexico trucking accidents that all people should be aware of.  These including the following:</p><p><b>Wrongful Death in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>The ultimate injury that any person can sustain is death.  Unfortunately with trucking accidents, <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death</a> is very likely given the serious and forceful impact of a trucking accident.  A victim may be killed directly as a result of the trucking accident, such as the force of the impact, a post-accident explosion or fire, or from the trauma of the impact.  But a may also be killed after the accident, even months after the accident, due to complications from the accident.  This includes serious organ damage, bone injuries, and brain injuries which cannot be controlled and healed.  Massive infections resulting from injuries in a trucking accident can also cause death.</p><p><b>Paralysis Due to New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Trucking accidents can cause a significant and forceful impact.  As a result of this impact, injuries can affect major body systems such as the spine.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Spinal cord injuries</a> can result in permanent paralysis and quadriplegia.  This means that nerves are injuries and the signals from the extremities and body to the brain may be altered and cut, making it impossible to send those signals.  This can result in numbness, pins and needles, and even a complete lack of movement.  Many victims of paralyzing injuries are no longer independent, especially victims with injuries high on the spinal column which may limit or prevent movement of any extremities.  These types of injuries are horrific.</p><p><b>Traumatic Brain Injuries Caused by New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries </a>affect the way a victim can think, process information, and even how a victim’s body can function.  Brain injuries can completely affect memory and prevent a victim from processing any information.  Victims can have trouble with basic functions, such as breathing and heart rate.  Victims can have difficulty concentrating and keeping a job, and elements such as simple as light can completely destroy a victim’s ability to function.  Traumatic brain injuries can also render a victim completely unable to care for hisself or herself, and lead to a slow, painful death such as seizure disorders.</p><p><b>Any New Mexico Trucking Accident Injuries Require Strong Representation, Especially the Three Worst Injuries Above!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Three of the Most Common Causes of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">Wrongful Deaths</a> in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>There are many different causes of motor vehicle accidents.  That is because there are a variety of factors which could contribute to a collision.  These range from driver error and passenger error, to environmental such as ice or dust storms, to even mechanical errors.  Serious motor vehicle accidents can result in the death of the driver or passenger due to any factor.</p><p>One of the most dangerous types of motor vehicles accidents is a trucking accident involving a large commercial vehicle such as a tractor trailer, tandem trailer, flatbed, tanker, 18-wheeler, or other large truck.  These trucks are both large and heavy, which means they have significant force behind them when they collide with an object such as another vehicle.  Because of the sheer force, trucking accidents also result in the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque Wrongful Death</a> of a victim.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> have handled many fatal trucking accidents occurring on highways and interstates such as Interstate 40, Interstate 25, and Interstate 10.  We offer FREE case evaluations to learn how we can protect your rights and your family’s rights after the death of a loved one.  <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact us</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn more how we can help you.</p><p><b>The Three Most Common Causes of Wrongful Deaths in Interstate Collisions with New Mexico Trucks</b></p><p>Speed – As with any motor vehicle, speed is a major cause of <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">wrongful deaths in trucking accidents</a>.  This is because these heavy and large tractor trailers build significant momentum the faster they go.  This is particularly true on the interstate highways.  Due to this momentum, the trucks require a greater stopping distance and more time to slow down to turn.  If a truck driver is not paying attention, he or she could easily fail to slow down in time which can result in a very serious trucking accident.</p><p>Drowsy/Fatigued Driving and Falling Asleep – Time is money, and truck drivers need to deliver their cargo to get paid.  The more they deliver, the more times they get paid.  Even though federal regulations and most state laws require truck drivers to sleep for a certain amount of time every day, and for truck drivers to keep an accurate log of their downtime, many truck drivers—and trucking companies—cheat the system and the regulations.  Many truck drivers will use energy pills to keep them awake to keep delivering cargo.  But sometimes this is not enough to keep a truck driver awake and the significant lack of sleep can cause a truck driver to fall asleep.  This will render a tractor trailer as an unguided missile, destroying whatever it hits.  Even if the truck driver does not fall asleep, the truck driver will still have lower reactions due to fatigue.  Truck driver fatigue is deadly and a common cause of wrongful death cases.</p><p>Impaired Driving Due to Alcohol or Drugs – Federal regulations prohibit a truck driver from consuming alcohol hours before his or her shift even starts, and also prohibits the use of any drugs—even prescriptions—which may make operating a commercial vehicle less-safe.  Yet, many truck drivers do not take these regulations seriously which result in serious injuries to others on the roadway.  Many truck drivers also resort to illegal drugs which will stimulate them and keep them awake, which is also dangerous because such drugs can alter a person’s perception, ability to react, and ability to process information.  On fact-moving interstates such as Interstate 40, Interstate 25, and Interstate 10, this can result in a life-threatening mistake.</p><p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents Causing the Wrongful Death of a Victim Need to be Represented by the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents Caused by Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Violations </b></p><p>Large commercial trucking companies such as FedEx, YRC Worldwide, HUB Group, Schneider National, Werner Enterprises, and many others use large highway systems such as Interstate 40, Interstate 25, and Interstate 10 to transport goods throughout the United States.  This is known as interstate commerce.  While each state has many specific statutory law applying to all trucking companies and truck drivers, each state’s laws will be slightly different.  Because of this extensive interstate commerce system which spans many states, there is a need for one uniform, regulatory authority to govern trucking companies and truck drivers.</p><p>This authority is known as the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/title49/b/5/3">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations or FMCSR</a>.  This is an extensive matrix of rules and regulations governing a wide-range of conduct, maintenance, and other safety rules.  Trucking companies and truck drivers are obligated to comply with these regulations no matter which state they are traveling in—including New Mexico.  When trucking companies or truck drivers violate these rules, it can result in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/practice-areas/trucking-accident-overview/">very serious and permanent injuries or even wrongful death to a victim</a>.</p><p><b>Common FMCSR Violations Resulting in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>A violation of a regulation is evidence of negligence when the regulation is meant to protect a victim from a certain harm, and the violation does cause that harm.  This is known as the doctrine of negligence per se.  Some common FMCSR violations which result in evidence of negligence include the following:</p><p>Section 392.3 – Ill or Fatigued Operator – truck drivers driving while tired, sleep deprived, and otherwise fatigued is a real threat to our roadways and a major cause of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.  That is because time is money, and most drivers force themselves to go as far as they can to make as much money as they can.  This section governs drowsy driving and falling asleep while driving, and prohibits truck drivers from operating a commercial vehicle when tired or his or her ability or alertness is impaired.</p><p>Section 392.4 – Drugs or other substances – like all motorists, this section make sure to prohibit any illegal drugs but also certain legal drugs which could effect one’s ability to operate a truck.  There is a catch-all section which governs any substance which renders a driver incapable of safety operating a vehicle.  Unfortunately, many truck drivers resort to illegal drugs to help them to stay away, and this section prohibits it.</p><p>Section 392.5 – Alcohol prohibition – similarly, this section governs alcohol consumption and absolutely prohibits the use of alcohol within four hours before going on duty or operating a vehicle, and further prohibits a truck driver from having any detectible amount of alcohol in his or her body.  This is a very strict rule and also commonly violated which results in motor vehicle accidents.</p><p>Section 392.6 – Schedules to conform with speed limits – this section applies for the trucking company, and requires the trucking company to not result deliveries faster than can be done while the truck driver is driving within the speed limit.  Said differently, the trucking company cannot force a driver to drive faster than the speed limit to meet the trucking company’s schedule.</p><p>Section 392.14 – Hazardous conditions; extreme caution – this section is very important and governs dust storms resulting in limited or no visibility.  In extreme weather situations, a truck driver must reduce speed as necessary to operate the truck safely and, if this cannot be done, the truck driver must stop until the vehicle can be safely operated.</p><p>There are other important sections which can be violated and result in <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">serious New Mexico trucking accidents</a>, but these are the most common one resulting in a finding of negligence per se.  These are also the more common ones resulting in wrongful death of victims.</p><p><b>Wrongful Deaths Caused by Violations of Federal Regulations Can Result in Compensation for Victims and Their Families</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Deadly Trucking Accidents on Interstate 25 Near Bernalillo, New Mexico</b></p><p>Many large commercial trucks such as tractor trailers, flatbeds, tankers, tandem trailers, big rigs, and 18-wheeler user Interstate 25 to travel from the southern part of New Mexico up to Santa Fe and beyond.  After leaving Albuquerque, Interstate 25 increases the speed limit to 75 MPH.  This becomes very dangerous as Interstate 25 travels through many large cities such as Sandia Pueblo and Bernalillo before getting to Santa Fe.  These areas result in increased passenger traffic.  This combination of more traffic, large commercial trucks, and passenger traffic results in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious New Mexico trucking accidents on Interstate 25</a> resulting in the wrongful death of an innocent traveler.</p><p>Here are the Caruso Law Offices, P.C., <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">we handle many wrongful deaths occurring on Interstate 25</a> by some of the largest trucking companies in the United States, including FedEx, Swift, J.B.

<p><b>Interstate 25 and Interstate 40 Trucking Accidents Near Albuquerque, New Mexico Caused by Texting While Driving Can be Deadly and Violate Federal Law</b></p><p>Technology has improved almost all facets of our lives.  Cell phones specifically have provided more than just convenience, but also safety in the ability to call for help in remote locations.  But one area where technology and cell phones has not improved out lives is driving.  Using a cell phone while driving is dangerous and deadly.  <a href="https://www.distraction.gov/stats-research-laws/facts-and-statistics.html">According to statistics</a>, distracted driving caused by cell phones while driving causes over 3,000 deaths and over 431,000 injuries each year.  This is an unacceptable number of causalities by a very preventable cause.  This is just negligence.</p><p>One of the most dangerous vehicles to be driving while texting is a large commercial truck such as a tractor trailer, tanker, flatbed, tandem, big rig, 18-wheeler, or other large truck.  These vehicles can become unguided missiles launched forward at whatever they hit—which is usually a smaller, passenger vehicle.  This is particularly dangerous on highways, such as Interstate 25 or Interstate 40 which go through Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Unfortunately, when a large truck collides with a small vehicle on the interstate, it will cause catastrophic injuries if not death to the occupants of the smaller vehicle in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking accident</a>.</p><p><b>New Mexico Law Makes it Illegal to Text While Driving</b></p><p>Under New Mexico Law, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">NM Stat. 66-7-374, subdivision (A)</a> provides that “[a] personal shall not read or view a text message or manually type on a handheld mobile communication device for any purpose while driving a motor vehicle . . . .”  <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">Subdivision (C) (1)</a> defines “driving” as “being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway or street and includes being temporarily stopped because of traffic, a traffic light, or stop sign or otherwise . . . .”</p><p>When a driver texts while driving anyway and causes an <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking accident</a>, it can be negligence per se.  This means that a violation of a statute meant to protect people from a certain harm can automatically be a finding of negligence against the violator.  Here, it would be the truck driver texting while driving hurting innocent people in trucking accidents.</p><p>In addition, common law finds that drivers who text while operating a motor vehicle and cause an accident could be negligent.  This is because all drivers owe a duty to others on or near a roadway to use reasonable care under the circumstances as a reasonably prudent driver.  If a driver fails to do that and causes a motor vehicle accident, the driver breaches that duty and is liable for all damages caused by that breach.</p><p><b>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations Prohibit Texting While Driving a Commercial Truck</b></p><p>Under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&=PART&n=pt49.5.392#se49.5.392_180">49 CFR section 392.82</a>, no driver of a commercial truck shall engage in texting while driving.  Further, no trucking company or motor carrier shall allow or require its drivers to engage in texting while driving.  These creates liability against both the truck driver and the trucking company.  The only exception is in the course of an emergency to summon police or help.</p><p>Like the statutory law, a violation of the CFR—which is a federal regulation which applies to all truck traveling on interstates—a truck driver violating this statute and causing a motor vehicle accident can be liable under the theory of negligence per se for <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">Interstate 25 or Interstate 40 trucking accidents</a> around Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p><b>Interstate 25 or Interstate 40 Trucking Accidents Caused by Texting While Driving Violate the CFR and New Mexico Law </b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Top Three Commercial Trucking Companies Kill on New Mexico Interstates</b></p><p>Any motor vehicle accident on a highway can cause very serious personal injuries or death.  But large commercial trucks such as big rigs, tankers, flatbeds, tractor trailers, tandem trailers, and other trucks are much more likely to result in fatal accidents on Interstates throughout New Mexico.  Many of these <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accidents</a> occur on Interstate 40, east and west through Albuquerque, or on Interstate 25, north and south though Albuquerque.  These high-speed collisions result in permanent and debilitating injuries, if not wrongful death.</p><p>Of these New Mexico trucking accidents occurring on New Mexico interstates, the three largest trucking companies account for some if not many of them.  The largest company is United Parcel Service of America and has had numerous trucking accidents.  Second is FedEx, which the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. recently successfully sued for causing a New Mexico trucking accident on Interstate 40 near Grants, New Mexico.  The third largest trucking company is J.B. Hunt Transport Services, which has also had several serious trucking accidents on interstates and highways.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured by one of these trucking companies, or any other trucking company in the United States, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  Our experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys can review your case and advise you how to best protect your rights.  We have a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/testimonials/">proven track record of success</a>, and will fight hard to obtain the maximum amount of compensation you may be entitled to.</p><p><b>New Mexico Interstate Trucking Accidents Causing Wrongful Death</b></p><p>Interstate trucking accidents are particularly dangerous because these commercial vehicles typically are carrying larger and heavier payloads.  At the great speeds vehicles travel on the interstate and highways throughout New Mexico, it creates significant momentum which must be dispersed when there is a collision.  It is this momentum that rips through smaller vehicles and causes horrific, catastrophic, and deadly injuries to victims.  In fact, New Mexico interstate trucking accidents occurring on Interstate 40 and Interstate 25 can easily cause <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful deaths</a> of victims on these roads.</p><p>Any commercial truck, whether one of the largest trucking companies in the United States or a simple weekend rental can cause a wrongful death.  Having <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">experienced New Mexico wrongful death attorneys</a> on your side and help your family recovery for the loss of a loved one.</p><p><b>New Mexico Wrongful Death Cases Caused by Trucking Accidents Need Strong Representation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>T-Bone New Mexico Car Accidents Can Cause Serious Injuries and Death to Victims</b></p><p>There are not many types of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accidents</a> scarier then a t-bone car accident.  These types of car accidents frequently result in very serious personal injuries and even death to occupants hit in the t-boned vehicle.  This is became the side panels of car are a lot thinner and without a crunch zone, thus placing very little between the oncoming car and the occupant of the car.  Whereas the front of the car has a large crunch zone and engine block separating the occupants from danger.  Without question, those usually injured or killed in a t-bone collision are the occupants of the vehicle that are t-boned—not the occupants of the vehicle which hits head on.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> have handled many t-bone car accidents.  We know that these types of collisions can cause debilitating personal injuries, significant pain and suffering, and even wrongful death.  Many times these types of car accidents result in he-said, she-said claims as to who should not have proceeded forward.  We have the experience, knowledge, and resources to thoroughly investigate your claim and prove the other driver was at fault to protect your rights to compensation.  Call us today for a FREE consultation to learn how we can help you and your loved ones.</p><p><b>Causes of T-Bone New Mexico Car Accidents</b></p><p>As noted above, <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">t-bone car accidents</a> are very dangerous for the occupants of the vehicle being t-boned due to the lack of a crunch zone and lack of safety equipment for that type of impact.  For instance, car seats and seatbelts are designed for rear end and front accidents.  They have the head restraint to accommodate that forward and back motion.  A t-bone car accident causes a side-to-side motion which is completely unsupported.  More and more vehicles nowadays have side curtains, but this still does not support the head and neck completely.</p><p>Beyond the safety equipment and physics, most t-bone car accidents are caused by the negligence—if not gross negligence—of one or more drivers.  Indeed, most instances of t-bone car accidents can be fully prevented.  This includes the following causes of t-bone car accidents:</p><ul><li>Running a red light;</li><li>Failing to yield;</li><li>Excessive speed;</li><li>Running a stop sign;</li><li>Failing to stop due to snow and ice;</li><li>Unable to see due to low visibility such as during a dust storm;</li><li>Mechanical failure of brakes;</li><li>Tire blowout;</li><li>Inexperienced driver;</li><li>Distracted driving;</li><li>Drunk driving or driving while ability impaired;</li><li>Street racing;</li><li>Texting while driving;</li><li>Unable to see due to overloaded vehicle;</li><li>Speeding through a roundabout;</li><li>Speeding to beat a yellow light;</li><li>Driving too fast in a parking lot;</li><li>Backing out of a parking spot too fast; and</li><li>Many other types of collisions.</li></ul><p><b>T-Bone New Mexico Car Accidents Can Kill and Maim</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Snow and Ice Can Create Havoc For All Motorists, Particularly Large Commercial Trucks Vehicle Can Result in Serious and Fatal <a href="/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque Trucking Accidents</a></b></p><p>Anytime there is snow and ice on the roadways, it is a very serious hazard which must be taken seriously and with due concern for the dangers it brings.  With snow and ice, there is decreased friction on the roadways which increases the time it takes drivers to stop.  It also creates a slipping hazard, causing vehicles to slide side-to-side, off the road, or out of lanes and into other hazards such as pedestrians or other vehicles.</p><p>The hazard of snow and ice is magnified for large commercial trucks due to their sheer size, weight, and momentum.  This makes it harder for large commercial trucks such as tankers, big rigs, 18-wheelers, flatbeds, tandem trailers, tractor trailers, and other trucks to stop, stay in their lane, and maneuver.  As a result, this naturally cases more <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking accidents</a> which result in serious <a href="/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">Personal injuries and W rongful Deaths.</a></p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys</a> know how dangerous large commercial trucks can be on the roadways.  We have handled many <a href="/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accidents</a> which have resulted in catastrophic injuries to victims.  Call us today by dialing (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation to learn how we can fight to protect your rights to compensation for your injuries, lost wages, medical bills, and pain and suffering.</p><p><b>Causes of Albuquerque Trucking Accidents in the Snow and Ice</b></p><p>Unlike other motor vehicles, large commercial trucks can be susceptible to snow and ice in different ways which create different hazards which end up resulting in <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">Albuquerque trucking accidents</a>.  This is due to their size, but also how they are constructed.  For instance, tractor trailers have a cabin and trailer which are connected at a junction.  Certain maneuvers, such as turning too fast to braking too hard can cause the truck to jackknife, which is where the trailer spins around to form a right angle with the cabin.</p><p>There are many different other unique hazards for trucks in snow and ice.  This includes the following:</p><ul><li>Jackknifing;</li><li>Rear end car accidents;</li><li>Side swipes;</li><li>Sliding out of lanes;</li><li>Rollovers;</li><li>Tailspins;</li><li>Tire blowouts;</li><li>Spinning out of control;</li><li>Unable to stay on the lane;</li><li>Skidding into other lanes or across the center line;</li><li>Failure to be able to stop;</li><li>Unable to control speed; and</li><li>Other types of snow and ice hazards.</li></ul><p><b>Albuquerque Trucking Accidents Caused by Snow and Ice Can be Prevented, but When They Aren’t, They Can Cause Death!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Snow and Ice is Inherently Dangerous and Can Cause Serious New Mexico Car Accidents, Including Massive Pileup Accidents and Deadly Collisions </b></p><p>While the snow may be pretty to look at, it is also pretty dangerous.  Snow and ice creates a slick surface on roadways increasing the time to stop due to a lack of friction and decreasing the maneuverability of a motor vehicle.  Black ice, ice that is essentially clear, flat, and smooth over the roadway, is particularly dangerous because it is very hard to see but just as dangerous.  When drivers encounter snow and ice on the roadways, they should slow down as reasonable under the circumstances to safely operate their motor vehicle.</p><p>However, many drivers do not do so.  Recently on I-40, one person was killed and 36 others injured due to snow and ice on the roadway which resulted in a massive pileup.  Other accidents on I-40 also resulted in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4044212/New-Mexico-State-Police-40-vehicles-wreck-slick-I-40.html">38 miles of the highway being closed down</a>.  In fact, N<a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/919126/crash-closes-westbound-i-40-near-carnuel.html">ew Year’s day was plagued with many icy stretches of highway</a> causing serious car accidents and heavy traffic.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a> caused by snow and ice, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque car accidents attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation and ensure you obtain the maximum amount you are entitled to.  We have a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/testimonials/">proven track record of success</a>, and will work hard to advocate for you and your loved ones.  Call us today at (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation to learn how we can help you recover from serious injuries after a New Mexico car accident.</p><p><b>Common Accidents Due to Snow and Ice</b></p><p>There may be no greater dangerous condition on a roadway than snow and ice.  This dangerous condition can form very quickly, form anywhere, and even be difficult to detect until it is too late.  This is particularly true on interstates and highways, where snow and ice can prevent motor vehicles from stopping in from, maintaining control, and staying in the vehicle’s designated lane.  This is particularly true for <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">large commercial trucks such as big-rigs, 18 wheelers, flatbeds, tankers, and other large tractor trailers who may more easily lose control and cause serious personal injuries</a>.</p><p>Snow and ice can cause many different types of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accidents</a>, which include the following types:</p><ul><li>Pileup car accidents;</li><li>Jackknife trucking accidents;</li><li>Rear end collisions;</li><li>Rollover accidents;</li><li>Spinout accidents;</li><li>T-bone accidents;</li><li>Sideswipe collisions;</li><li>Single car accidents off of the roadway;</li><li>Trucking accidents due to unable to stop;</li><li>Head on collisions; and</li><li>Many more serious accidents.</li></ul><p><b>Snow and Ice on the Roadway can Injure or Kill Motorists: Call us Today For a FREE Consultation to Learn How We Can Help You After a New Mexico Car Accident</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Trucking Accidents Can <a href="/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Cause Serious Back Injuries</a> Resulting in Spinal Fusions</b></p><p>Motor vehicle accidents can result in massive and damaging collisions causing serious harm to the occupants.  <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">Albuquerque trucking accidents </a>are one of these types of motor vehicle accidents which almost always result in massive impacts and devastating injuries.  Frequently collisions of this magnitude affect a person’s spine and cause permanent damage.  The spine is very resilient and comprised of sturdy bones protecting the spinal cord, but it is still very susceptible to certain motions like the violent back and forth motion of whiplash accidents.  In fact, very severe impacts causing whiplash injuries can permanently damage the spine, vertebrae, discs, and nerves.</p><p>Unfortunately, sometimes the only treatment for the pain is to fuse the spine to prevent it from moving and irritating the nerves causing the debilitating pain.  This treatment is invasive and permanent, limiting a victim’s range of motion and affecting a victim’s entire life.  Other surgeries may be required to fuse additional sections and further limit the range of motion.  All fusion surgeries are risky because the surgeon is working within centimeters of the spinal cord.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys</a> know how devastating spinal fusions are for a victim of a catastrophic trucking accident.  We have a proven track record of representing those injured in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">serious Albuquerque trucking accidents</a> and protecting their rights to compensation.  Contact us today by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn more how we can help you obtain the maximum compensation you may be entitled to.</p><p><b>Spinal Fusion Surgeries in Albuquerque Trucking Accidents </b></p><p>The structure of the spinal column is essentially the vertebra made of bone, the jelly-like disc structure, and nerves radiating from the center spinal cord through the bone and around the jelly-like discs.  An undamaged spinal column has the appropriate spacing to allow the nerves to not be pinched, the discs to act as proper shock absorbers between the vertebrae, and the bone to remain in position.</p><p>But when an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking accident</a> violently shifts the spinal column, it can come out of alignment.  Sometimes the discs can be ruptured or damaged changing their shape.  This can permanently compress on a nerve, causing severe and debilitating pain every time the spinal column is moved—even just a little bit.  Other times the impact can be so severe that the vertebra is compressed and flattened, also changing the shape and causing serious pain.</p><p>A spinal fusion is a procedure which can help prevent any movement of the vertebrae and discs on the nerves.  Usually a two level fusion involves removing the disc between two vertebrae, placing a cement disc there in its place that will not move, and placing rods along those two vertebrae to keep them from moving.  Screws are inserted in the top and bottom vertebrae to anchor the rod.  This keeps the two vertebrae from moving and rubbing against the nerve.  Thus, the nerve does not get irritating and cause pain.</p><p>As you can appreciate, this procedure is incredibly invasive and permanent.  There are serious risks involved.  The pain from the injuries is horrific, the pain from the surgery is intense, and the pain during recover is long and constant.  Physical therapy can take months if not years to return to some semblance of normalcy.</p><p><b>Albuquerque Trucking Accidents Bad Enough to Require Surgical Fusions are Real</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Car Accidents Can Cause Very Serious and Debilitating Cervical Injuries</b></p><p>Any <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a> can cause serious personal injuries, even at low speeds, to the neck or spine.  This is particularly true of rear end collisions which put pressure on the spine, spinal cord, and the entire spinal column because of the whiplash motion.  The strain is particularly intense on the cervical spine which is also particularly susceptible to injury.  As a result, serious and debilitating injuries to the cervical spine (the neck) can require years of treatment and invasive surgery, including a fusion.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we understand that cervical injuries are particularly devastating, painful, and debilitating because we have handled many cervical and spinal injuries.  Our e<a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">xperienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys</a> can help protect your rights to compensation and ensure your future medical expenses and pain and suffering is accounted for.  Call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can help you recover what you are entitled to.  You only pay us if we win your case, and your consultation is with our attorneys is free.</p><p><b>Common Injuries in Albuquerque Car Accidents</b></p><p>The spine is meant to protect the spinal cord, and it is does a very good job at doing so.  However, the spine is also susceptible to certain motions such as whiplash motions.  This can case the spine to hyperextend and then snap back quickly.  This can cause the material in between the individual vertebrae, discs, to come out of alignment, become damaged, and put pressure on nerves radiating out of the spinal cord.  This can cause pain throughout the body.</p><p>Some common examples of cervical (neck) injuries as a result of an Albuquerque car accident includes the following:</p><ul><li>Cervical disc injuries;</li><li>Cervical nerve injuries;</li><li>Cervical vertebrae fractures such as compression fractures;</li><li>Torn cervical muscles;</li><li>Cervical fusion;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Spinal Cord injuries</a>;</li><li>Paraplegia;</li><li>Cervical discectomy;</li><li>Torn cervical ligaments;</li><li>Vein or artery damage;</li><li>Quadriplegia;</li><li>Torn cervical tendons;</li><li>Muscle strains;</li><li>Decreased range of motion;</li><li>Inability to turn head;</li><li>Fatigue;</li><li>Headaches; and</li><li>Other permanent and debilitating injuries.</li></ul><p><b>Neck Injuries are Very Serious and Effect Everything You Do; Call us Today if you Have any Neck Injuries from Albuquerque Car Accidents!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When First Responders Fail to Use Reasonable Care, They Can be Liable for <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Car Accidents</a> Causing Personal Injuries</b></p><p>We all know that when we see an emergency vehicle on the roadway with its flashing lights on or sirens on, we need to yield to the right of way.  And we also know that emergency vehicles get certain exceptions from complying with the vehicle and traffic law.  If we get into a collision with an emergency vehicle, we may immediately feel like this is our fault and we are the cause of the accident.  After all, aren’t we supposed to always yield to the right of way of an emergency vehicle?</p><p>Not always.  In fact, sometimes emergency vehicles can be the sole cause of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a>.  If you or a loved one have been injured in a New Mexico car accident caused by an emergency vehicle, do not guess whether it was or was not your fault—call our experienced <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> to learn how we can help you obtain compensation for your injuries by dialing (505) 883-5000.  Emergency responders must follow certain laws in able to use the exceptions to the vehicle and traffic law.  When they fail to do this, it can result in very serious car accidents and personal injuries to victims.</p><p><b>Emergency Vehicles Needs to Use Either Flashing Lights or a Siren to Get Us to Yield to Their Right of Way</b></p><p>We know that we are supposed to yield to emergency vehicles.  This is both common sense and under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-332/">NM Stat. Section 66-7-332</a> which requires under subdivision (A) “[u]pon the immediate approach of an authorized emergency vehicle displaying flashing emergency lights or when the driver is giving audible signal by siren, exhaust whistle or bell, the driver of every other vehicle shall yield to the right of way and shall immediately drive to a position parallel to, and as close as possible to, the right-hand edge or curb of the roadway clear of any intersection and shall stop and remain in that position until the authorized emergency vehicle has passed except when otherwise directed by a police officer.”</p><p>The important part of this law is that the emergency vehicle must be using either its lights or sirens for us to yield.  If the emergency vehicle is not using either, then we do not have to legally yield.  However, sometimes emergency vehicles still proceed as if we all have to still yield to them without their lights or sirens on.  This can result in serious New Mexico car accident and whoever is at fault—including an emergency vehicle—will be liable for the victim’s injuries.</p><p><b>Emergency Vehicles Need BOTH a Flashing Light and Siren to Run Red Lights or Stop Signs and to Exceed the Speed Limit</b></p><p>Some of the the common traffic laws that we know emergency vehicles can violate are red lights or stop signs and the speed limit.  Indeed, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-1/section-66-7-6/">NM Stat. 66-7-6 (B)</a> permit “[t]he driver of an authorized emergency vehicle may: 2) proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, but only after slowing down as necessary for safe operation; 3) exceed the maximum speed limits so long as he does not endanger life or property . . . .”</p><p>Further, subdivision (C) requires that an authorized emergency vehicle may only violate these two sets of traffic laws only when it “sounds an audible signal by bell, siren or exhaust whistle as reasonably necessary when the vehicle is equipped with at least one lighted lamp displaying a red light visible . . . .”  Moreover, subdivision (d) provides that “[t]his section does not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons nor does it protect the driver from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others.”</p><p>There are several important points to note.  First, an emergency vehicle running a red light or stop sign must still slow down as necessary to go through the light safely.  Second, an emergency vehicle may only exceed the speed limit when the driver can still do so safely in a manner that does not endanger life or property such as losing control or not being able to stop or maneuver properly.</p><p>Third, an emergency vehicle MUST have both its lights and siren on in order to violate the traffic law.  This is to provide both an audible and visual cue to other drivers.  The failure of having both is dangerous and does not allow an emergency vehicle to break the law.  Fourth and finally, an emergency vehicle—even if both the lights and siren are on—still must act in a way that is not reckless.</p><p><b>If Your Have Been Injured By an Emergency Vehicle, CALL US TODAY!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also <strong><a href="/Contact.shtml">contact us</a></strong> on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When a Tire Blowout Causes an <a href="/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque Trucking Accident,</a> People Can be Hurt and These Victims Can Get Compensation</b></p><p>Large commercial trucks such as tankers, 18-wheelers, big rigs, flatbeds, and other trucks are very dangerous vehicles for several reasons.  Their shear size and weight makes them very dangerous vehicles.  On highways, this combination of size and weight coupled with fast speed give large commercial trucks significant momentum which can cause real damage.  But in addition to their physical characteristics, large commercial trucks are also dangerous because they have many moving parts.</p><p>One of the obvious—and literal—moving parts are the tires.  Some big rigs can have a lot of wheels and backup wheels.  The tires may not always be routinely checks and maintained well.  With so many parts, there is a great chance for there to be errors, mistakes, or for things to go wrong.  One common thing that can go wrong is a tire blowout.  This can cause damage in both the debris of the tire which launches out and hits other vehicles.  But this can also cause the large commercial truck to lose control or not be able to stop, causing another very dangerous hazard on the roadway.  Both situations can cause <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">serious trucking accidents</a>.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in an Albuquerque trucking accident caused by a tire blowout, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We have the experienced necessary handling trucking accident cases throughout New Mexico to know how to do a thorough investigation of the trucking company and truck driver, as well as the trucking accident.  We will fight hard to determine whether the trucking company and truck driver properly performed tire maintenance and inspections, and whether they were negligent in allowing that truck on the road.  Call us today to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Causes of Tire Blowouts in Albuquerque Trucking Accidents </b></p><p>When a tire blowout occurs in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking accident</a>, there can be two different types of accident.  The first is the debris from the tire.  Most people do not realize, trucking tires are massive, thick, and very heavy.  Even small pieces of tire debris can be heavy another to break through a windshield and serious injury or kill a vehicle occupant.  This pieces can be exploded off the tire and literally launched at other cars causing damage.  Or these pieces could have exploded and then scattered across the roadway when another vehicle runs over the debris and launching it at another vehicle.</p><p>Another cause of <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking accidents</a> in tire blowouts if when the large commercial truck loses a trie or several tires and is unable to keep control.  Sometimes this can result in the loss of control for a vehicle which ends up making it very difficult to maintain in a lane and away for other hazards.  On a highway going 65 MPH or more, this can turn a tractor trailer into an unguided missile.  A tire blowout can also cause a truck to be unable to stop or slow down, which is also very dangerous and cause result in very serious personal injuries.</p><p><b>Albuquerque Trucking Accidents Caused by Tire Blowouts are Very Dangerous</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

TITLE: Failure to Wear a Seatbelt in a New Mexico Car Accident: Is the Victim at Fault?

<p><b>If a Victim of a New Mexico Car Accident is not Wearing a Seatbelt, is that Victim Partially at Fault?</b></p><p>Even simple car accidents can bring about complicated issues.  This is because very few car accidents involve straight liability against a defendant since there can be many causes of a car accident.  This includes when a victim of a car accident may have contributed to the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a>.  This is known as comparative fault, and it is almost always an issue.  This will lower the amount a victim receives.</p><p>In New Mexico, <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-372/">NM Stat. 66-7-372 subdivision (A)</a> requires all occupants of a motor vehicle to wear a seat belt.  In some states, victims of car accidents who do not wear a seatbelt can actually be comparatively at fault for their injuries.  This is because it is well-known that seatbelts can save lives and prevent injuries.  This comparative fault doctrine or theory is known as the “seatbelt defense.”</p><p><b>Seatbelts are Required in New Mexico, but is there a “Seatbelt Defense”?</b></p><p>However, even though New Mexico requires all occupants of a motor vehicle to wear a seatbelt, New Mexico law does not find this to be an instance of comparative fault.  This was first discussed by the New Mexico Supreme Court in Thomas v Henson which found there was no common law “seatbelt defense” in New Mexico and the Legislature would be required to permit one.</p><p>One year later, the Legislature considered the Supreme Court’s decision and enacted the Safety Belt Use Act.  This codified <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-373/">NM Stat. 66-7-373</a>, which provides under subdivision (A) that the “[f]ailure to be secured by a child passenger restraint device or by a safety belt as required by the Safety Belt Use Act [66-7-370 NMSA 1978] shall not in any instance constitute fault or negligence and shall not limit or apportion damages.”  This second of law makes it clear that there is no statutory authority for the “seatbelt defense.”</p><p><b>No Seatbelt Defense in New Mexico Means No Comparative Fault</b></p><p>The Supreme Court has found no common law (judge made) seatbelt defense in New Mexico, and the Legislature has found no statutory law for the seatbelt defense.  This means that a victim of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a> who is not wearing his or her seatbelt cannot be comparatively at fault for not wearing a seatbelt.</p><p>This is a huge finding, as this could significantly reduce a victim’s recovery.  In some states which have the seatbelt defense, if the jury awards a victim $100,000 and finds the defendant 100% at fault for rear ending the victim, but the jury also finds the victim is 50% at fault for not wearing his or her seatbelt, the victim will only recover $50,000.  In New Mexico, the victim would still recover $100,000.</p><p><b>Even if You Are Not Wearing Your Seatbelt in a New Mexico Car Accident, You Will Not be Found Comparatively at Fault!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Car Accidents Can Cause Serious, Permanent, and Debilitating Eye Injuries</b></p><p>Our most engaged sense is vision.  We use it everyday for every task.  It is a necessary sense to do many tasks, such as drive a motor vehicle, watch TV or a movie, or perform other daily tasks.  Despite being so important, our eyes are vulnerable.  They can be easily injured and permanently damaged.  While they are resilient, they can be damaged beyond repair in even simple, low-speed <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accidents</a>.</p><p>If your or a loved one has suffered an eye injury due to a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a>, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We take all of our calls very seriously, especially eye injury cases.  These are devastating injuries which can be particularly traumatizing for young children.  We work hard to fight for the rights of victims with eye injuries, and you only pay us if we win your case.</p><p><b>Causes of Eye Injuries in New Mexico Car Accidents</b></p><p>There are many possible causes for eye injuries in car accidents which can cause permanent partial or full vision loss in one or both eyes.  These causes include the following:</p><ul><li>Airbag injuries – this can be caused by the shear force of the deployment impact, or by the chemicals, powders, and other elements in airbags to help them deploy properly.</li><li>Broken glass – car glass is not meant to scatter, but in significant crashes the glass will nonetheless splinter and scatter.  This can easily get in a victim’s eyes causing damage.</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic Brain Injuries</a> – even if the eye itself is not damaged, if the brain is injured it can cause severe swelling which can damage the optic nerves leading from the back of the brain (occipital lobe) to the eyes.  If the optic nerve is damaged significantly, it is near impossible to repair given its location through the bottom-center of the brain.</li><li>Globe Rupture/Crushing Injury – in some circumstances, the force exerted on the eye can be so severe and powerful that it can either crush the eye or rupture the eye.  This makes it very difficult to put back together properly, and likely results in both loss of vision and loss of the eye.</li><li>Orbital fractures – the orbit is the bones creating the eye socket in the skull.  When there is significant force on the face, this can cause the orbit to fracture—especially the bottom or floor of the orbit.  This can easily damage the eye due to the shards of bone and fact that the eye is crushed into an unnatural position.</li></ul><p><b>Types of Eye Injuries in New Mexico Car Accidents</b></p><p>There are several different types of eye injuries which could occur in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a>.  These range from the mild, such as irritation, to the severe, such as complete and total loss of the eye.  Some common injuries include the following:</p><ul><li>Irritation from debris or chemicals in the airbags;</li><li>Surface scratches which heal;</li><li>Corneal abrasions which damage the surface of your eye but can be quite severe;</li><li>Swelling;</li><li>Subconjunctival hemorrhages (bleeding of the eye);</li><li>Lacerations or cuts to your eye;</li><li>Lacerations or cuts to your eye lids which affect how the eye is moisturized and protected;</li><li>Orbital fractures which can permanently damage the eye;</li><li>Crushing injuries to the eye;</li><li>Rupture injuries to the eye;</li><li>Iris injuries;</li><li>Retina contusions;</li><li>Retina tears;</li><li>Retinal detachments;</li><li>Optic nerve injuries;</li><li>Partial vision loss;</li><li>Permanent vision loss;</li><li>Serious and life-threatening infections; and</li><li>Many more.</li></ul><p><b>If You or a Loved One have Suffered an Eye Injury, Contact Our New Mexico Car Accident Attorneys NOW!</b></p><p>Do not underestimate eye injuries.  If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Injuries in New Mexico Trucking Accidents Cause Serious Personal Injuries, and Usually Result in Future Surgeries; Negligent Trucking Companies Should Pay for These Injuries </b></p><p>It is an obvious fact that large commercial trucks such as tankers, tractor trailers, 18-wheelers, and other trucks can cause significant, permanent, and life-threatening injuries.  Victims lucky enough to survive may face a lifetime of medical treatment and surgeries to just make their lives manageable.  While initially the medical expenses may be compensated, future surgeries which are bound to occur in 10, 20 or even 30 or more years could be very expensive, debilitating, and cause significant pain and suffering to an injured victim.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been seriously injured in a <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact our <a href="http://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> to learn how we can help ensure your future surgeries and medical treatment are paid for by the negligent trucking company or truck driver.  These negligent trucking companies and truck drivers are liable for future surgeries, but most attorneys do not always fight to obtain those damages or have the proper proof required.  Here at the <a href="http://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we have the proven track record of representing those injured in trucking accidents and obtaining damages for future surgeries and medical treatment  Call us for a FREE consultation to learn how we can help by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You only pay us if we win your case!</p><p><b>Future Surgeries and Medical Treatment CAN be Paid in Your Lawsuit, Even if Your Surgeries are More Than 30 Years in the Future</b></p><p>As most people may already know, personal injuries lawsuits are primarily to recovery pain and suffering.  Most people also know that lost wages and medical bills can be compensated in a lawsuit.  Some people even know that lost earnings if you cannot return to your job can be compensated.  Of course, in a wrongful death case, everyone knows the estate can be compensated for damages.</p><p>But most people do not know that future medical expenses can also be compensated.  And not just for injuries in the near future.  Commonly with serious personal injuries, such as those in New Mexico trucking accidents, a victim will have debilitating injuries which will continue to manifest itself over many years.  Given the type of injury, there could be the need for future medical expenses and medical surgeries—even if that injury is not causing a problem now.</p><p><b>A Common Example of Future Surgeries or Medical Treatment Which Can be Compensated in a New Mexico Trucking Accident</b></p><p>A common example is a knee injury.  If a knee is destroyed in a <a href="http://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, that knee may need to undergo arthroscopic surgery to repair the damage done.  This is likely done right after the collision to help the person get back on his or her feet.  But because of the extensive trauma, the knee joint will likely end up arthritic and the joint will begin to deteriorate.  This knee will need to undergo a knee replacement.</p><p>If the victim is 20 years old at the time of the accident, he or she has a life expectancy of about another 58 years.  When the victim needs a knee replacement, usually about 20 years from the trauma, the victim will be 40.  However, knee replacements are generally only good for about 17-20 years, meaning the victim will need another knee replacement at the age of 60 and again at the age of 80.</p><p>Using the proper proof, such as expert testimony from a life care planner and an economist, plus with the support of the victim’s treating physician or physicians, a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking accident attorney</a> can establish the fact that the victim’s knee will need to be replaced three times after the accident—even 60 years in the future!  The court or the jury can award the victim these damages for the future so that the injury and the surgeries are paid for.</p><p><b>Call Our Experienced Attorneys to Get Your Future Injuries Paid for in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="http://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When Albuquerque Car Accidents Occur in a Construction Zone, the Violating Vehicle and Even the Construction Company May be Liable for Your Injuries</b></p><p>Most people do not like driving in construction zones.  This is because there can be heavy traffic and delays, confusing traffic patterns, and debris all over the road.  They can be tight or difficult to navigate and other drivers will still drive to fast, aggressively, or improperly.  Other times it may appear that the construction staff will not pay attention to the vehicles, they will not know what they are doing, and they may make simple mistakes which can cost you damage to your vehicle, injuries to you, or even your life!</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accident</a> caused in a construction zone, contact our experienced <a href="https://carusolaw.com/accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>  We understand that claims in construction zones can be complicated because there are a lot of different entities, including a state, municipality, or other department.  The cause of the accident could be due to another driver, or from the construction company, or both.  This can make claims confusing, difficult, and risky if not litigated properly.  We have a proven track record of representing those injured in construction zone car accidents, and we offer a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>New Mexico Law Governs Construction Zones</b></p><p>Far too many drivers fail to comply with construction zone signage and requirements.  This can easily result in very serious car accidents causing serious personal injuries or even death.  Whenever the speed is reduced, lanes are combined, or flagmen are present, there is good reason for drivers to pay attention because the traffic pattern may have been changed or is compromised, and the regular speed and direction of traffic may no longer be safe.  But some people just do not listen.</p><p>And they should.  Under New Mexico law, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-303.1/">NM Stat. section 66-7303.1</a> (c) provides “[e]very pedestrian or person who operates a vehicle on any street or highway shall obey all signs, signals, markings, flagmen or other traffic-control devices that are placed to regulate, control and guide traffic through a construction zone.”  If a driver violates this section of law by ignoring the lowered speed limit or a flagman that tells a driver to stop but the driver continues, the driver could be liable for the car accident.</p><p>Not only is this accident a criminal penalty under the same section of law under subdivision (D), but this also means that the driver may be automatically negligent as a matter of law under the doctrine of negligence per se.  This doctrine allows a victim to use the violation of a statute meant to protect the victim from the harm the victim suffered to establish the defendant was negligent.  This is an important tool for a plaintiff.</p><p><b>Construction Accidents Could Also be the Fault of a Construction Company</b></p><p>Not only could other drivers be the cause of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accidents</a> occurring in construction sites, but the construction company could also be liable.  This could be because the cones or barricades were not properly done, the directions are confusing, or the flagmen made errors which caused the accident.</p><p>For instance, if the road is a single lane road and one flagman waved one driver to go down the road and the flagman at the other end of the road waved another driver to go down the road at the same time, this could cause a head-on collision and serious personal injuries.  The construction company would be liable for the causing the accident, at least partially at fault, since both flagmen are employees and gave instructions in the course of their employment.</p><p><b><a href="/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Injured in an Albuquerque Car Accident</a> in a Constructions Zone?  Call us today!</b></p><p>As you can see, these types of claims can be complex if there are multiple parties potentially at fault.  But this does not mean your rights to compensation are any less!

<p><b>Broken Bones Are Common Injuries in <a href="/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Trucking Accidents</a> and Can Lead to Serious, Permanent, and Prolonged Future Injuries</b></p><p>No one wants to be in any motor vehicle accident.  But if someone had to choose, he or she certainly would pick anything but a trucking accident with a tractor trailer, flatbed, tanker, or other large commercial truck.  These vehicles are massive and have a lot of momentum.  This means that force behind the truck needs to be dispersed into whatever it hits.  Frequently this means smaller passenger vehicles are mangled and shredded in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking accidents</a>.  This causes catastrophic injuries to victims, commonly including broken bones.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a> causing broken bones, contact the experienced <a href="/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> by calling (505) 883-5000.  We have handled many broken bone cases and we know not just the value of the past pain and suffering, but also the future pain and suffering and injuries.  This may include future surgeries you may not even be aware of.  This is why you need to contact our attorneys for a FREE consultation to learn how we can protect your rights.  There is nothing to lose—you will not pay us anything unless we win your case!</p><p><b>Reasons Why Broken Bones Occur in <a href="/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Trucking Accidents</a></b></p><p>Given that commercial trucks are quite large, heavy, and move fast on highways or interstates, it is clear why broken bones are common injuries.  Smaller passenger vehicles just get crumpled in trucking accidents which causes crushing injuries.  These types of crushing injuries easily break bones, even at low speed.</p><p>This is because of physics and momentum.  The momentum of a tractor trailer needs to be completely dispersed for it to stop.  Usually this is achieved by its braking system.  But in the event of a crash, the momentum of transferred into whatever the truck hits.  This literally bends metal and scatters bone.</p><p><a href="https://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">Trucking accidents</a> also cause broken bones just from the shear fact that most trucks are on highways or interstates.  This means the truck is moving at a fast rate of speed.  Not only does this increase momentum, but this reduces reaction time.  This makes an accident more likely and more dangerous.</p><p><b>Types of Broken Bones in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>There are many different types of broken bones which could occur in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking accident</a>.  Some of the most common types of broken bones which may allow a victim to receive compensation for include the following:</p><ul><li>Comminuted fracture – when the bone is broken into several pieces, usually caused by a crushing fracture;</li><li>Avulsion fracture – when a piece of the bone is separate from the main mass, usually when it is pulled on by a tendon or ligament, or when the bone is impacted forcefully;</li><li>Buckled fracture – when the bone’s ends are driven into each other as if they were being crushed together, usually in crushing accidents;</li><li>Traverse fracture – when the bone fractures across the bone on a right angle (perpendicularly), usually in a side impact;</li><li>Stress fracture – when the bone has small, hairline cracks;</li><li>Occult fracture – a small fracture in the bone which does not appear on x-rays until the bone begins to heal weeks later, but still very painful and may require surgery;</li><li>Linear fracture – when the bone breaks parallel to the bone;</li><li>Oblique fracture – when the break has a curved or sloped pattern, usually with downward force;</li><li>Spiral fracture – when the bone fracture in a spiral fracture, usually when the bone is twisted to its breaking point; and</li><li>Compound fractures – when the bone breaks the skin.</li></ul><p><b>Broken Bones in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Understanding How IMEs can Affect a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Car Accident</a> Lawsuit and Your Compensation</b></p><p>There are many moving parts to any <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Personal injury</a> lawsuit.  There are also many medical records, treatment notes, and healthcare providers involved in most personal injury lawsuits.  This means there is a lot of medical evidence or testimony.  Most of the medical evidence and testimony is generally favorable to the plaintiff’s treatment.  This is because these individuals are treating physicians and healthcare providers who have one thing in common; <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">taking care of and healing the plaintiff’s personal injuries after a car accident</a>.</p><p>However, there are other types of doctors that could come into play.  In any personal injury lawsuit, there is the option for a defendant or defendants to hire their own physician to perform an examination of the plaintiff.  This is called an independent medical examination, or an IME.  These types of examinations are directed by the defense attorney, paid for by the defense attorney, and the report is first given to the defense.  The “independent” part of the examination clearly seems to be lacking.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a>, you will likely end up having to submit to an IME with a doctor chosen by the defense attorney.  This is a skewed procedure, even though it is set up to be “independent.”  You need to have an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorney</a> represent you to ensure your rights are protected, such as the attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. Call us today for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will help advise how we can help protect your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Why IMEs Are Allowed in New Mexico</b></p><p>While a plaintiff has several treating healthcare providers who are essentially advocating for his or her health, the defendant does not have any.  All of the medical providers and evidence come straight from the plaintiff’s providers who see the plaintiff regularly and who are paid by the plaintiff.  This is skewed for the plaintiff.</p><p>This is why the defendant is allowed to have his or her own doctor perform an examination of the plaintiff.  This allows the defendant to get their own physician to formulate an opinion as to the plaintiff’s injuries.  This doctor is used to check the care rendered by plaintiff’s healthcare providers to ensure it is proper.</p><p>The bottom line, however, is that a properly noticed examination by an IME doctor is required.  This means means that a victim does have to go to an IME, otherwise the victim’s case could be dismissed.</p><p><b>How to Turn a Defendant’s IME Doctor and Report Against Them</b></p><p>Given that a defendant’s IME doctor issues a report that is paid for by the defendant, that is strong fodder for a good plaintiff’s attorney to poke holes in the bias.  But this will not be enough.  An <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorney</a> will also be able to make several other arguments to attack the propriety of an IME report.</p><p>This includes that the IME doctor is determining what could be years of pain and suffering, treatment, and disability of a victim after just a 30 minute examination.  It is simply not possible for one examination to determine a victim’s entire set of injuries from a motor vehicle accident which could have occurred years ago.</p><p>Another main point is where the IME doctor does not review all of the records or does not have the original imaging studies.  There are two ways to attack this.  The first way is that the IME doctor is simply not using all of the objective evidence to make a determination as to the care and treatment of the plaintiff.  The second way to attack this is that the IME doctor is just using the radiology reports but likely coming to a different conclusion than the treating physicians who have looked at both the radiology reports and the actual imaging studies.  This undermines the IME doctor and helps your case in front of the jury!</p><p><b>IME Reports and <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Car Accidents:</a> How to Use These Reports Against Defendants </b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

by a<strong> <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a></strong>, and none are worse than a traumatic brain injury.  These types of injuries affect the very being of a person; their brain and mind.  This type of injury could change the way a person thinks, their life, their thoughts, their ability to process information, and even basic metabolic functions we take for granted.  These injuries are scary, cause significant pain and suffering, and can result in a long list of expenses.</p><p>This is why a traumatic brain injury requires a significant amount of evidence and support to prove the damages, the future expenses, and get the compensation a victim deserves.  An experienced New Mexico traumatic brain injury attorney will know the types of experts required and how to maximize a victim’s recovery.  Here at the <a href="/"><strong>Caruso Law Offices, P.C</strong>.</a>, we have a proven track record of representing traumatic <strong><a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Brain Injury</a></strong> victims and ensuring that they are get the compensation they deserve.  Call us today for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights!</p><p><b>Three Experts Needed in Traumatic Brain Injury Cases</b></p><p>In all lawsuits, experts are used to put in prove and establish facts.  This is because the parties are not necessarily competent to perform advanced calculations or provide medical testimony.  Neither are attorneys, even if the attorneys have significant experience doing so.  The law requires people with specialized skill, training, and education to put forth these calculations and establish this proof.</p><p>Thus, no matter how many brain injury cases that a lawyer has had, a medical doctor will also be better suited for providing this testimony.  Thus, this is why some experts are always needed to help prove your case.  For traumatic brain injuries, there is an important trio of experts.</p><p><b>Medical Experts Such as Neurologists </b></p><p>After a car accident, a victim will likely go right to an emergency department for emergency treatment.  In the emergency room, the healthcare providers will perform diagnostic tests and treat the immediate medical concerns.  Frequently with serious head injuries the emergency room staff will make initial diagnoses.  Some of these diagnoses may include brain injuries like concussions or bleeding.  This can be used to prove your case.</p><p>But a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">traumatic brain injury</a> is more than just a concussion or bleeding.  A traumatic brain injury requires a showing of permanent damage to the brain that has effected the way the brain processes information or completes its normal functions.  A concussion alone will not necessarily do that.</p><p>Enter a neurologist.  These are medical professionals who specialize in the central and peripheral nervous system which includes the brain.  These medical specialists can perform diagnostic tests—such as MRIs—and determine whether are is structure damage to the brain.  These medical experts can also perform tests which set a baseline to determine functioning differences in the brain and how the brain is now working.  Thus, a neurologist can take a diagnose of a concussion and determine how it has affected the brain.  This is by far the most important expert in a traumatic brain injury case.</p><p><b>Life Care Planners</b></p><p>With <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">traumatic brain injuries</a>, there likely will be the future need for continued treatment and medication.  This could be in the form of yearly MRIs or imaging studies to monitor the damage to the brain, or this could be regularly scheduled surgical procedures to relieve pressure from the skull.  There could also be medication treatment regimes that a victim has to follow, including even just basic painkillers.  In very severe cases, a home health aid or nurse may be necessary to take care of a victim of a traumatic brain injury.</p><p>A life care planner is an expert that is trained to know what the future treatment is and how expensive it will be in the future.  Most life care planners have some medical training, such as a medical degree, nursing degree, or other related degree.  These individuals will use the medical records and treatment notes or reports from the neurologists to determine what is needed in the future.  This is very important to establish what a victim’s future damages are.</p><p><b>Economists </b></p><p>An economist is another very important expert and probably the second most important.  An economist is a number cruncher and will calculate a broad range of figures.  Most common are lost wages or lost earning capacity for the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">traumatic brain injury victim</a>, such as when the victim cannot return to work or cannot return to the same job and has to take a lesser paying job due to functioning limitations.  This is a very complicated calculation and requires inflation and pensions, social security, retirement plans, and other programs to be taken into consideration.</p><p>An economist will also the figures that the life care planner providers and calculate those against inflation as well.  This is important because it ensures a victim gets the full-value of the future care required.</p><p><b>Hiring a Trio of Experts Helps Ensure Your Compensation for Traumatic Brain Injuries in New Mexico Car Accidents</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has

BODY:
<p><b>New Mexico Car Accidents Worsening Pre-existing Injuries Can be Compensated For, but Not Fully and it Can be Difficult to Prove but NOT Impossible</b></p><p>As we get older, our bodies begin to break down.  This is no more true than of the back and spinal column.  This can be worsened by sports in high school or college, or even just normal wear and tear as we age.  Other injuries prior injuries could also cause vulnerable spots on our bodies which can be more susceptible to additional injuries.  We could even be healing from an injury when we are injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a>.  This can worsen our preexisting injury or the wear and tear done on our bodies.  But can it be compensated?</p><p>Generally, the law is that you take the plaintiff as you find them.  This means that, even if a plaintiff is known as an “egg shell plaintiff”—or a plaintiff who can easily be hurt—the defendant is still liable for the injuries caused.  For example, if a defendant <a href="https://carusolaw.com/fractured-hip-in-albuquerque-hit-by-car-accident/">breaks the hip of a healthy, young athlete or an elderly man, the defendant will still be liable for a broken hip</a>.</p><p>Where it gets complicated is where the broken hip is caused by some other comorbidity.  In the example above, it could be that the elderly man as arthritis which lowers the value of a broken hip.  Or perhaps the athlete previously suffered a broken hip in a football accident.  This would make a second hip fracture less valuable as the hip is already susceptible to arthritis and future pain and suffering.  But the important point in each injury is that, just because there is a comorbidity or prior injury, the victim can be compensated.</p><p><b>A Special Note about Back Injuries in New Mexico Car Accidents</b></p><p>New Mexico car accidents generally cause back injuries or back pain.  This can be particularly because whiplash injuries put a lot of stress on the spine.  But this is also because the spine is very complex and can be easily injured even in low speed collisions.</p><p>With back injuries, however, there is almost always the case for a pre-existing back injury or degenerative condition.  In fact, the claim of a degenerative condition in a victim’s back is almost a go-to defense made by a defendant in any motor vehicle accident—even for young victims in their 20s or 30s!  This is particularly because the spine begins to narrow and bare stress from the day we begin to stand.  Most people also complain of back pain at least once in their life, even at a young age.</p><p>But again, this degenerative pain in the back is NOT the cause of your current pain and suffering.  Prior to your motor vehicle accident you were not missing work, complaining of pain, or taking pain medication.  After your motor vehicle accident you may be required to endure all or some of these issues.  That does not meant that you cannot be compensated for it, but rather that your compensation may be lowered due to pre-existing injuries.</p><p>Thus, any victim can receive compensation for pre-existing injuries.  A victim with prior injuries may not get the same value as a victim without any prior injuries.  But a victim will nonetheless be compensated.  This is a vicious battle sometimes and requires an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorney</a> to help prove your entitlement to damages.</p><p><b>Pre-Existing Injuries Can Be Compensated and Can Result in Significant Verdicts in New Mexico Car Accidents</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Experienced New Mexico Car Accident Attorneys Can Prove Cases Using Technology Like OnStar: This Can Lower Your Comparative Fault and Maximum Your Compensation!</b></p><p>Some car accidents are fairly straight forward, such as the defendant running a stop sign or failing to yield.  Other times there are witnesses who will testify that the defendant was speeding or driving recklessly prior to the car accident.  But other times it may not always be clear who caused the car accident and there may not be witnesses.  The defendant may even claim that you are the cause of the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a> and lie about what happened.  Not only is this frustrating and unethical, but if you are really hurt it can literally add insult to injury.  It may even feel that you cannot win because of the other defendant’s lies.</p><p>But an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorney like those at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> know how to use technology to help support your claim.  Trucks have computers on board known as ECUs which work like a data flight recorder on a plane.  While a computer like this is not standard in other vehicles, more and more cars on the roads have OnStar or manufacturer-specific computers which hold a lot of the same data.  Using this data can help prove that defendant is lying and you were harmed by the defendant’s negligence.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a> and the defendant is lying about what happened or you are unsure how to prove your case, make sure to call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We know how to use technology to prove your case and get you the maximum compensation you may be entitled to.</p><p><b>Understanding Why OnStar and Vehicle Computers are So Important</b></p><p>When someone is lying about causing a car accident, it can be incredibly frustrating.  You want to find a way to prove them wrong and make them look like the liar they are.  Computers are the best way to do that.  While large commercial trucks all have electronic computers keeping track of the vehicle’s vital information, such as information during a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking accident</a>, most cars do not have these computers.</p><p>However, vehicles with OnStar and other manufacturer monitoring programs DO keep this information. These computers send that data to the monitoring company during a “triggering event” like a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a>.  This data sent depends on the company, but many times this includes speed, movement direction, point of impact, force of impact, and other relevant data.  This can be used to stop a defendant who is lying about the cause of the accident.  For example, if the defendant claims your headlights were not on at night, many monitoring data keeps track whether light were on at the time of impact.  You can disprove the defendant’s claims and attack his or her credibility.</p><p><b>Why Using Technology is Important </b></p><p>By using OnStar and other monitoring data to help disprove the defendant’s lies, you are not only helping to support your case and attack the defendant’s credibility, but you are also limiting your comparative fault.  In any negligence action, there can be multiple actors who could be negligent.  This includes the victim.  The percentage of fault by the victim will reduce the award of damages.</p><p>Therefore, if the jury verdict is $100,000 and the victim is found to be 30% at fault of the accident—or comparatively at fault—the victim will only take home $70,000.  Thus, it is important to use whatever evidence you may have to help prove your claim.  This includes using data such as the OnStar or monitoring computer information in vehicles.</p><p><b>OnStar and Monitoring Data Can be Used to Prove your New Mexico Car Accident Claim</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Texting While Driving is Both Illegal and Incredibly Dangerous: New Mexico Trucking Accidents Caused by Drivers Texting is Downright Negligent</b></p><p>We all know that large tractor trailers are very dangerous vehicles on the roadway.  They are large, heavy, and move fast on highways giving them a lot of momentum and force.  The only thing scarier than this is the fact that sometimes tractor trailer truck drivers take their eyes off the road to text on their phones.  This ends up turning the tractor trailer into an unguided missile traveling at a high speed.  When this blind battering ram hits something, such as a smaller passenger vehicle, the results are devastating.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a> caused by a truck driver texting while driving, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We have the experience necessary to know how to thoroughly investigate your claim and determine whether the truck driver was texting at the time of your accident.  This is not east to do, and many cell phone carriers will refuse to comply with subpoenas and requests for cellular data from lesser experienced attorneys or pro se victims.  They will not do this to our attorneys and they do not stand a chance in hiding relevant evidence.  Ensure your rights are protected and call us today!</p><p><b>New Mexico Law Prohibits Texting While Driving</b></p><p>The common law, or judge-made law which has evolved for decades of interpretation, provides that a driver shall operate his or her motor vehicle with reasonable care under the circumstances which includes not texting while driving.</p><p>Similarly, it is also statutory, or legislature-made law, which prohibits texting while driving.  Specifically, under N<a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">M Stat. 66-7-374, subdivision (A)</a> provides that “[a] personal shall not read or view a text message or manually type on a handheld mobile communication device for any purpose while driving a motor vehicle . . . .”  <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">Subdivision (C) (1)</a> defines “driving” as “being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway or street and includes being temporarily stopped because of traffic, a traffic light, or stop sign or otherwise . . . .”</p><p>Therefore, a truck driver who is texting while driving is violating both the common law standard and the statutory standard.  If the truck driver causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident </a>which results in personal injuries to a victim, the trucker driver will be negligent.  Such finding is under both the common law standard, but also under the statutory standard under the doctrine of negligent per se.</p><p>Under this doctrine of negligence per se, a defendant is automatically negligent for causing the type of accident protected by the statute and causing a certain type of harm to a certain group of people that that statute was meant to protect.  In a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accident</a> caused by texting while driving, a defendant may very likely be found automatically negligent.</p><p><b>Texting While Driving is Dangerous, and Illegal—Call Us if You Have Been Hurt by a Truck Driver Texting While Driving</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico truck accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

Accidents</a> Can Result in Permanent and Debilitating Injuries Affecting an Entire Family—Get the Representation Your Deserve to Protect Your Rights</b></p><p>Our brain is an amazing miracle of nature.  It is incredibly complex that many facets of the brain are not even completely understood by scientists.  Our brain can perform amazing tasks such as complicated math, instinctually react to stimulus without our conscious thought, store amazing amounts of information, and carry on basic functions automatically while handling all of these computations.  Yet, our brain is rather fragile.  Even in low speed car accidents, our brain and sustain serious injury from the back and forth rocking inside of our heads.  This can heal, but other times this can cause permanent damage.  The more serious the collision, the more serious the damage and the less likely the damage will heal.</p><p>This is why victims of New Mexico car accidents need to have competent and <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys to represent them.  Here at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we work with many car accident victims who have

Brain</b></p><p>The brain is approximately three pounds and controls all functions of the body.  The brain also interprets information from the outside world and processes it through the use of our five senses.  The brain is protected by the skull, which is a very hard series of plates and pieces of bone, which completely encompass the brain.  At the base of the skull, the brain branches into the brainstem and extends into the spinal cord which continues down the spinal column.  From the spinal column, nerves branch out to our extremities.  These are the highways which will gather sensation and information and relay it back to the spinal column, up the spinal cord, through the brainstem, and back to our brain for processing.</p><p>The brain is comprised for three main parts.  The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is composed of the right and left hemispheres.  This part of the brain performs higher functioning tasks, like interpreting sensations such as touch, vision, hearing, and speech.  The cerebrum is also responsible for reasoning, learning, fine motion movement and control, and even emotions.</p><p>The cerebellum is another part of the brain and performs a lot of tasks.  The cerebellum is located under the cerebrum and it is important because it governs balance and movement.  The last main structure of the brain is the brainstem.  This may be the most important part of the brain and it is protected by the other structures of the brain mentioned above.  This is because the brainstem controls all autonomous functions such as breathing, heart rate, temperature, digestion, and similar functions.  The brainstem is also the main hub of all the nerves in the body as it is just before the start of the spinal cord.</p><p><b>Type of Traumatic Brain Injuries from New Mexico Car Accidents</b></p><p>There are several different types of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/"><b>traumatic brain injuries</b></a> which could occur from a car accident.  These vary in severity, and are more likely to be worse in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com"><b>tractor trailer trucking accidents</b></a>.  Some common types of traumatic brain injuries include the following:</p><ul><li>Concussions – even minor concussions can have long-lasting and permanent effects on the brain;</li><li>Contusion – this is like a bruise but on the brain, and large enough contusions needs to be surgically removed;</li><li>Coup-contrecoup injuries – this is when there are contusions on both sides of the brain (opposite sides) because the brain slide toward and hit one side then ricocheted backwards into the other side;</li><li>Penetration/traumatic injury – this type of injury is where the skull is pierced and something enters into the brain, such as debris, fragments, or objects;</li><li>Diffuse axonal injury – this is an injury due to violent shaking of the brain which can damage portions of the brain even though the brain is not impacted and can cause tearing of nerves and other structures inside the brain; and</li><li>Other types of brain injuries.</li></ul><p><b>Traumatic Brain Injuries are No

<p><b>Many Times After a New Mexico Car Accident the Defendant Says “I Didn’t See You”: Is That a Defense?</b></p><p>No one plans to be in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident.</a>  But when someone is a victim of a car accident, many times the defendant driver who caused the car accident will immediately say “I didn’t see you” or “sorry, I didn’t see you.”  Sometimes defendants will blame someone else for the accident, such as someone that blocked their view like a double-parked car.  Other times defendants will blame the environment, such as a dust storm or sun glare.  But is this ever an excuse for causing a car accident?</p><p>The answer is almost always a resounding “no.”  Drivers who cause a car accident cannot place all of the blame on other people or events.  If you or a loved one has been injured in a car accident caused by another driving saying “I didn’t see you,” contact our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico car accidents attorneys</a> to learn how we can protect your rights.  We offer a FREE consultation and we will hear the facts of your case, learn about your injuries, and advise you how we can help you obtain compensation for your injuries.  Call us today by dialing (505) 883-5000 and hear how our attorneys can help you and your family.</p><p><b>“I Didn’t See You” is Not an Excuse to Causing a New Mexico Car Accident</b></p><p>Of course, if a driver saw you he or she likely would not have driven into you and caused the car accident.  It becomes almost instinctual for a defendant to immediately claim that he or she did not see you and provide and excuse.  Most times this excuse is just a defense mechanism.  After all, people do not like to admit their mistakes.</p><p>But “I didn’t see you” is not an excuse.  Under New Mexico common law, or judge-made law developed over years of refinement, a driver has a duty to see what there is to be seen when operating a motor vehicle.  This means that a driver operating a motor vehicle blindly is breaching this duty.  Blind turns and moving without looking is dangerous and negligent.</p><p>Thus, a driver that makes a blind turn and causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a> but claims he or she could not see is not going to escape liability.  The law provides that a driver who cannot see should not move forward until it is safe to do so.  This is also common sense.  A common example when this excuse is given is when there are double-parked or a truck blocking a view.  The defendant will attempt to go around and cause a collision.  The excuse “I didn’t see you” does not work because the defendant is moving without being able to safely do so and unable to see where he or she is going.  It is also true that the defendant is not being forced to go forward or to go around the other vehicles.  Even an illegally parked vehicle will not allow a defendant to completely escape liability.</p><p><b>“I Didn’t See You” in Inclement Weather Does Not Work</b></p><p>New Mexico has a lot of very serious dust storms which can cause complete blindness for motorists on the roadway.  In this situation, a motorist must slow down as reasonable under the circumstances to ensure he or she can move forward safely.  This may include pulling over and completely stopping until the dust storm has passed.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/nm-truck-drivers-who-cant-see-in-dust-storms-cant-speed/">Drivers who attempt to continue forward without being able to see and cause a motor vehicle accident are going to be found to be negligent</a>.</p><p><b>Excuses for Causing New Mexico Car Accidents Will Rarely Work, and “I Didn’t See You” is Not a Good Excuse</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Car Accidents Can Cause Very Serious, Permanent, and Painful Back Injuries Requiring Years of Treatment and Surgery</b></p><p>The spine is one of the most important structures in the human body.  It encases the spinal cord in a boney case to protect it from injury.  The spine also gives our body strength and stability, and the large muscles around the spine are used in almost every single motion we make.  The spine is also the delivery system for the nerves which branch out of our spine and to the various parts of our body, including our extremities.  Many vital arteries or veins also hug the spine and weave in and out of it, which the spine affords the extra protection.</p><p>But the spine is vulnerable to certain traumatic impacts.  One of these is a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a>.  The large the impact, such as with a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">tractor trailer accident</a>, the larger and more dangerous the injury.  If you or a loved one have been injured in an Albuquerque car accident causing serious back injuries, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We have the legal experience and the medical knowledge to help advocate for your position and ensure you obtain the maximum compensation you may be entitled to for your injuries.</p><p><a href="/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/"><b>Anatomy of the Spine</b></a></p><p>Our spine is comprised of 33 different bones, known as vertebra or the plural vertebrae.  Of these, only the top 24 vertebrae are movable because the bottom are fused.  The first set of vertebrae are called the cervical vertebrae, and there are seven of them.  These generally form your neck from the base of your head to the start of your shoulders.</p><p>The second set of vertebrae are called thoracic vertebrae and are your mid-back.  These vertebrae hold the rib cage, protect the heart and lungs, and make up the largest section of vertebrae in your body.  There are twelve thoracic vertebrae.</p><p>The third set of vertebrae are called lumbar vertebrae, and these form your lower back.  This portion of your spine is meant to bear the weight of the body and they are much larger in size.  There are five lumbar vertebrae.</p><p>The fourth set of vertebrae is called the sacrum and these five sacral vertebrae are fused together, meaning they do not move.  The last set of vertebrae is called the coccyx region, and there are four fused bones here which make up your tailbone.</p><p>All vertebrae are surrounded by large muscle groups which help protect them from damage.  All vertebrae also contain a varying amount of your spinal cord, which is a crucial anatomic structure originating in your brain and traveling through your spinal cord; this is called the central nervous system.  Each vertebra in your spine is separated by a disc, which essentially provides a cushion between each vertebra and prevents them from grinding each other down.</p><p><b>Albuquerque Car Accidents Causing Injuries to the Back</b></p><p>Any <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a>, no matter the speed, can cause serious injury to a victim’s back.  These injuries can be caused even at low speeds, such as an 8 MPH car accident in a parking lot.  Of course, the faster the speed and the greater the impact, the more likely there will be very serious back injuries.</p><p>Rear end car accidents generally cause some of the worst back injuries because the body and the spine is placed in a vulnerable position.  The forward motion and the quick snap-back, known as a whiplash motion, can easily cause the discs between your vertebra to rupture, herniate, or slip out of place.  This can place pressure and pain on the nerve coming out of your spinal cord.  In very serious instances, this violent motion can even <a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">severe the spinal cord causing paraplegia or quadriplegia</a>.</p><p>Back injuries sometimes do not always manifest themselves right away.  After a car accident, the back can take several days, weeks, or even months to get sore, swell, and cause the pain.  This does not mean that the defendant is not liable for your injuries, only that it may be harder to prove.  This happens because the injuries to the discs and muscles surrounding the back may be slightly damaged initially, but not heal properly and cause further complications.  Other times the injuries simply do not begin to cause symptoms until weeks later.</p><p><b>Back Injuries Caused by <a href="/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque Car Accidents</a> may be Eligible for Compensation</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact us</a> on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents Caused by Running Stop Signs Can Kill</b></p><p>As motorists, we know that stop signs and red lights are very important traffic control devices.  These help dictate the right of way and the order vehicles can travel.  They help to make intersections, which are very dangerous areas of roadways, safer by requiring a lane of travel to come to a full stop.  Sometimes this is at an intersection where all vehicles entering the intersection can stop.  Other times this is at an intersection where only one direction needs to stop; the other direction can still proceed.  This is particularly important with the significant increase in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">large commercial trucks on our roadways which can cause serious personal injuries in a collision</a>.</p><p>Motorists and even pedestrians at intersections with traffic control devices such as stop signs and red lights have an expectation that other vehicles will abide by those devices.  In fact there is a legal duty to do so.  When a motorist fails to follow the traffic control devices, that is a breach of the duty of care.  When this breach causes personal injuries or damages to another, the violator may be found to be negligent.  When the violator is a large commercial truck, both the truck driver and the trucking company can be liable to all victims.</p><p><b>New Mexico Trucks Failing to Stop at Stop Signs are Negligent and Negligent Per se</b></p><p>Under the common law, which is judge-made law evolved over the years, <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">a truck driver is negligent</a> when he has a duty of care, breaches such duty, and the breach causes damages.  A truck driver has a duty of care to stop at a stop sign.  When the truck driver runs the stop sign, he or she breaches the duty of care.  If the truck driver collides with another vehicle and causes personal injuries to another when he or she breaches the duty to stop at a stop sign, the truck driver will be found negligent by the common law.</p><p>Under the same facts, a truck driver can also be negligence as a matter of law under the doctrine of negligence per se for a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>.  This doctrine finds that a statutory violation which is meant to protect a class of people from a certain harm, and causes harm to that class of persons, is an automatic finding of negligence.  This includes a stop sign under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-330/">NM Stat. 66-7-330</a>, which requires “every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop intersection indicated by a stop sign shall stop . . . and after having stopped shall yield to the right-of-way to any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway or which is approaching so closely on the highway as to constitute an immediate hazard . . . .”</p><p>Therefore, a truck which fails to stop at an intersection and collides with another vehicle may be negligence per se.  Even if a truck stops at the intersection and then proceeds, if the truck does not do so safely the truck can still be negligence per se.</p><p><b>New Mexico Truck Accidents Caused by Failing to Stop at a Stop Sign is Negligence and Victims can Receive Compensation for their Injuries!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000 You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Rear End New Mexico Car Accidents Can Cause Serious Spinal Injuries, Including Permanent and Debilitating Injuries</b></p><p>All car accidents have the potential to cause serious personal injuries.  This can be no more true than <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">tractor trailer accidents</a>, high speed collisions, and rear end car accidents.  In fact, rear end car accidents are very dangerous because of the vulnerable position that the victims in the lead car are in.  Injuries from rear end car accidents can cause life-threatening and permanent injuries, including quadriplegia, paraplegia, and even death.</p><p>If you or a loved one have sustained a spinal injury in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a> due to a rear end collision, you may be entitled to compensation.  Contact the experienced <a href="/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident lawyers at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a free consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will review your case and advise you how to protect your rights to compensation.  We have the experience and knowledge handling serious spinal injuries, including fractures or spinal cord injuries, and we can help ensure you receive the maximum compensation you may be entitled to.</p><p><b>Reasons Why <a href="/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Spinal Injuries</a> Are Common in Rear End Car Accidents</b></p><p>Rear end car accidents force the passengers in the lead vehicle to lurch forward and then whip backwards.  The faster the impact, the more violent this lurch and whip will happen.  Generally speaking, this is known as whiplash.  It places great pressure on the neck muscles, ligaments, and tendons.  It also places great pressure on the spinal column and spinal cord.  This can, in turn, cause pressure on the nerves coming from the spinal cord.</p><p>Many times the victims of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">rear end car accidents </a>do not see the impact coming before it happens.  This means that many times a rear end car accident occurs before a victim can brace.  This creates a greater whiplash type injury as the body is not braced for impact.  This causes serious injury.</p><p><b>Types of Spinal Injuries from Rear End Car Accidents</b></p><p>There are many different types of injuries which can be caused by a rear end car accident.  Most of these injuries are focused on the neck (cervical) and mid-back (thoracic) spine.  This is generally the part of the spine which will take the most abuse from the whiplash motion.  Some common injuries include the following:</p><ul><li>Ruptured discs;</li><li>Herniated discs;</li><li>Torn ligaments or tendons it the neck;</li><li>Fractured vertebrae;</li><li>Nerve damage;</li><li>Nerve impingement;</li><li>Concussions;</li><li>Dislocated shoulder;</li><li>Facial injuries from hitting the steering wheel;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/orbital-blowout-fractures-in-new-mexico-car-accidents/">Orbital blowout fractures</a>;</li><li>Spinal cord ruptures;</li><li><a href="/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Spinal cord injuries;</a></li><li>Fractured bones; and</li><li>Related injuries.</li></ul><p><b>If You Have Been in a Rear End New Mexico Car Accident Causing a Spinal Injury, Don’t Delay—Call Us Today!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 847-3206  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Drivers Who Speed are Drivers Who Kill and Cause Serious Personal Injuries in New Mexico Car Accidents</b></p><p>As any driver knows, there are speed limits posted on the road.  When there is no speed limit posted, the speed limit is the state speed limit.  Thus, drivers know that when they are traveling above the speed limit, they are traveling above the speed rated for the road.  This rating is determined by assessing the type of road, the location, the physical shape or curvature of the road, blind spots, amount of traffic, and sometimes the condition of the road.  These are important figures and considerations, because they help to protect those on or around the roadway from serious injuries.</p><p>But many people still speed and ignore the posted speed limits.  This is a very dangerous practice and can cause serious personal injuries or even death.  If you or a loved on have been injured or seriously killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a> caused by a driver speeding, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>  We represent many victims and families of victims who have been seriously injured or killed in catastrophic car accidents.  Call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn how we can protect your rights.</p><p><b>Reasons Why Speeding on Roadways Kills</b></p><p>Traveling above the speed limit creates a hazard for people on and off the road.  This can result in very dangerous circumstances which almost guarantee a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/speeding-driver-caused-new-mexico-car-accident/">serious car accident and horrific injuries when a driver is speeding</a>.  This is because speeding does a few things which magnify the danger and the damages, which include the following:</p><ul><li>Speeding reduces reaction time – this gives motorists a shorter period of time to react to an issue on the roadway which would require the motorist to turn away, brake, or swerve.  Because the reaction time is shorter, a motorist has less time to make these maneuvers and, in turn, needs to be a better driver to perform these maneuvers.  At a first speed, however, no amount of skill can avoid a collision.</li></ul><ul><li>Speeding increases stopping distance – the faster a motor vehicle goes, the more stopping time it will need to come to rest.  In driver’s ed class, this is generally taught as car lengths for stopping.  The faster a car is going, the more friction that will be required to stop the vehicle and the more stopping distance that is needed.</li></ul><ul><li>Speeding increases momentum – the higher a vehicle’s momentum, the more force it has and the more force it will need to disburse to come to a stop.  This means that a vehicle which collide with another object, all of the momentum will be transfers and will need to be disbursed to get the vehicle to stop.  The force gets transferred to the passengers and causes personal injuries them to.</li></ul><p><b>Injured by a Driver Speeding?  Have Us On Speed Dial to Represent You!</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a New Mexico car accident, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Car Accidents Can Cause Serious and Permanent Injuries, Commonly Broken Bones Which May Require Surgery</b></p><p>No one plans to be in a car accident, but they still occur all too often.  We hope that if we are in a car accident, that we can walk away unharmed.  But that too all too often does not happen, and there are serious injuries.  One of the most common types of injuries in an Albuquerque car accident is a broken bone or a fracture.  This type of injury can literally happen from the toes all the way to the head, and can bring a varying degree of pain and suffering, recovery time, and complications.  Many times a fractured bone will require surgical intervention to fix.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accident</a> and suffered a broken bone or fractured bone, contact our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We have knowledge of both the law and the medicine and can strongly advocate for your position, inform the judge or jury of your injuries, and ensure you get the compensation you deserve for your injury.  Contact us today for a FREE consultation to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation in car accidents causing broken bones or fractured bones requiring surgery.</p><p><b>Common Surgeries or Procedures for Broken Bones or Fractured Bones in Albuquerque Car Accidents.</b></p><p>There are generally two <a href="https://carusolaw.com/types-of-broken-bones-in-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accidents/">types of procedures for broken bones or fractured bones</a>.  One if called a closed reduction, which is when the pieces of broken bone do not need to be manipulated or can be manipulated without opening up the skin to do so.  This could be when the broken bones do not separate, and crunched in, or can be “popped” back into place.  The other type of general surgery is an open reduction, which occurs when the surgeon must cut into the flesh to manipulate the broken pieces of bone to get them to heal properly.</p><p>Sometimes an open reduction will require more than just physical manipulation.  Sometimes a car accident causes such significant trauma, such as in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">tractor trailer truck accidents</a>, where the bone is broken into several pieces that will just not stay together.  When his occurs, a physician may need to use medical hardware to keep the bone pieces in place.  This could be done with a plate, rod, metal bar, pins, or screws.  The hardware it put into the broken pieces of bone to keep them together while they can naturally heal.  Sometimes after the bone has healed, this hardware can be removed in a separate surgery if the patient is experienced pain or discomfortable from the installed hardware.</p><p><b>If You or a Loved One Had Painful Hardware Installed to Fix a Broken Bone from an Albuquerque Car Accident, Call Our Experienced Attorneys Today!</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in an Albuquerque car accident, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Two Riders Were Injured in a New Mexico Motorcycle Accident When a Driver Made a Negligent Lane Change and Failed to Yield to the Right of Way When Entering the Roadway</b></p><p>Motorcyclists are the most vulnerable type of motorists on the roadway.  This is because they are not protected by a large steel frame, with airbags, side impact curtains, seatbelts, and other safety devices that other motorists have.  Motorcyclists are also harder to see on the roadway due to their slimmer profile and smaller size.  This is a recipe for a serious motor vehicle accident which can cause serious personal injuries.</p><p>Recently this recipe for disaster occurred.  <a href="http://www.koat.com/news/2-critically-injured-after-being-thrown-from-motorcycle/41724848">As reported by an Albuquerque news agency</a>, a motorcyclist and his younger passenger were traveling on NM 528 when the driver of a passenger motor vehicle entered onto the roadway and into the motorcycle’s lane.  Confronted with this emergency situation, the motorcyclist swerved to avoid the collision and struck the median causing the motorcycle to slid across the roadway.  The driver and young passenger were thrown from the motorcycle and seriously injured.</p><p>If this sounds like a <a href="http://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico motorcycle accident</a> you or a loved one have gone through, contact our <a href="http://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">New Mexico motorcycle accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> by calling (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation.  We have represented many victims of motorcycle accidents who have had to swerve out of the way due to a negligent driver coming into his or her lane.  We work hard to protect the motorcyclist’s rights to ensure they get the maximum compensation they may be entitled to.</p><p><b>Unsafe Lane Changes are Negligent Under New Mexico Law</b></p><p>The violation of a New Mexico vehicle and traffic law can result in a finding of negligence per se.  Under the legal principle of negligence per se, there is an automatic finding of negligence where the defendant violated a statute meant to prevent the type of accident and type of injury which occurred.  This can be a very strong tool to use in your motor vehicle accident case.</p><p>Unsafe lane changes can be negligence per se.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-317/">New Mexico Stat. 66-7-317</a>, subdivision (A) provides that a vehicle driving in a lane “shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety[.]”</p><p>Additionally, like the new report noted above, when a vehicle enters the highway it must be done safely.  This is because <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-331/">New Mexico Stat. 66-7-331 </a>requires a vehicle entering the highway from a private road or driveway shall yield to the right of way of all other vehicles on the roadway.  If a vehicle fails to follow this law and causes a motor vehicle accident, such as the motorcycle accident above, the driver may be negligent per se.</p><p><b>New Mexico Motorcycle Accidents Caused by Negligent Drivers Making Unsafe Lane Changes or Failing to Yield to the Right of Way of Other Motorists is Negligent Per Se</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="http://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico motorcycle accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Large Commercial Trucks Are Dangerous in Dust Storms and Can Cause Very Serious New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Large commercial trucks are heavy, quickly gain momentum, and require a lot of distance to stop.  At high speeds on interstates this can be a deadly recipe even in the best of conditions.  However this is not always the case.  We know that <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico can suffer some very serious dust storms</a> which can absolutely limit visions and decrease traction, both which make it harder to operate any motor vehicle—especially a large commercial truck such as a tanker, big rig, flatbed, semi, 18-wheeler, or other massive truck.</p><p>As drivers of passenger vehicles, we can do everything possible in our hands to drive safely in dust storms and on even more generally on the road.  However, this does not guarantee that a truck driver will.  If you or a loved one are injured on a highway or interstate during a dust storm because of a negligent truck driver, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> to learn how we can help protect your rights.  We have the skill and knowledge from years of representing victims and families in New Mexico trucking accidents in various cases including <a href="/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">Wrongful Death</a> matters.  Call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Reasons Why Dust Storms are Dangerous and Deadly</b></p><p>The main reason why dust storms are so dangerous is because they limit and obscure vision.  On highways and interstates when motorists are driving at a high rate of speed, this can result in very serious problems.  It can decrease the time a motorist has to react to hazards in the roadway, while hiding some hazards which would normally be visible but now are not because of the heavy dust storm.</p><p>For large commercial trucks, dust storms are very dangerous because truck drivers need all the time and distance they can to stop their vehicle.  The failure to do so can result in collisions with other motor vehicles and, on the interstate, result in a pileup.</p><p>Another reason why dust storms are dangerous is because they can reduce traction on the roadway by blowing sand and other debris onto it.  It may not sound like this could cause a big difference, but even a little bit of sand and dust can reduce friction and extend the time to stop—even if it is just by a foot.  When you are talking about a large commercial truck, a foot extra of stopping time can be the difference between a full stop, a soft tap, or a collision resulting in <a href="http://www.albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">serious personal injuries in a trucking accident</a>.</p><p>A third reason why dust storms are so dangerous are because they general serious gusts of wind.  While not as must of an issue for smaller passenger vehicles, a large tractor trailer or tandem trailer could be blown over or even just blow off course and into another lane.  This can result in a collision with another vehicle and, again, on a highway or interstate this can cause a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious New Mexico trucking accident</a>.</p><p>The final reason why dust storms are so dangerous is because they can conceal accidents caused by the other reasons.  Meaning, after there has been an accident, the dust storm can make it hard for other vehicles approaching the accident scene to see the crash.  This can result in a pileup accident and cause more injuries to others on or around the roadway.</p><p><b>New Mexico Truck Drivers and Trucking Companies Need to Protect All Of Us in Dust Storms</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trials Require a lot of Evidence to Prove your Albuquerque Trucking Accident Case, Including Some Very Important Evidence</b></p><p>Unless you have been involved in a serious motor vehicle accident, you may not know what type of evidence is required to win such case at trial.  We all know that there is a lot of paperwork and documents needed, but most people do not recognize the vast amount of documents and the diversity of the documents.  This is important because, if you are ever involved in a serious motor vehicle accident, knowing what types of evidence may be available will help you help your attorney prepare and win your case.</p><p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking accidents</a>, there are some special types of evidence not necessarily available in the other types of motor vehicle cases which can be very helpful to your case.  This is why you need to retain an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorney</a> to represent you and prove your case with these diverse types of evidence.  Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we have the trial experience, <a href="https://carusolaw.com/testimonials/">proven track record</a>, and knowledgeable staff to acquire these types of evidence and present them in front of the jury.  We know how to hunt down these sources and force those holding the evidence to give us what we need to conduct a thorough investigation.  If you or a loved one have been injured in an Albuquerque trucking accident, let us fight for your rights by calling use for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Types of Evidence in All Motor Vehicle Accidents</b></p><p>There are many different types of evidence that are relevant and necessary to help prove your case.  The two most common types of evidence are the medical records demonstrating your personal injuries, and the police report or investigations.  Medical records can be from the treating providers after the accident, such as emergency department records and follow-up treatment with a specialists.  The police report and investigations can be very helpful, but sometimes not always available or completed.  Even if there is a police report, the document may be light on details.  What is really beneficial is when the police conduct an accident reconstruction or investigation as this is a free expert report for you to help prove your case.</p><p>Another very common type of evidence that most people do not realize is important is testimony.  Prior to your trial there will be depositions, or oral questions on the record, wherein the witnesses or parties will answer questions in front of a stenographer or court reporter.  The questions are asked by the opposing attorney or both attorneys.  The testimony is generally admissible at trial, particularly to box in witnesses or catch a witness in a lie.</p><p>Other testimonial evidence could come in the form of an expert.  This expert could be used to explain your injuries and future medical care, or to help explain the cause of the accident.  Expert testimony can also come in the form of an economist who can establish your lost wages and lost earnings.  Your Albuquerque trucking accident attorney may also decide that a life care planner is necessary, as this type of expert can explain what future medical needs the victim will have.</p><p><b>Some Evidence Unique to Trucking Accident Cases</b></p><p><a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking accident</a> cases contain all of the evidence of other cases, but also some important additional information.  One of the most common and fought over types of evidence unique to trucking accident cases is the event data recorder, known as EDR, information.  This is a tiny chip within the truck’s computer system which keeps track of an astounding amount of information such as speed, brake use, amount of time driving, direction, whether the driver was accelerating, whether the truck was moving side-to-side, and many other types of information.  This data can be make-or-break and easily prove a case, such as where a truck driver falls asleep at the wheel and does not brake before impact.  The data is, however, easily destroyed—either intentionally or mistakenly.  It needs to be properly taken from the truck before it is erased forever.</p><p>Another common type of evidence unique to <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accident cases</a> is a driver’s logbook.  This keeps track of where the truck driver is coming from and going to, the time driving, and the time resting.  If a trucking accident occurs due to a fatigued or sleep deprived driver, the logbook can be used to demonstrate violations of the federal regulations requiring a certain amount of sleep per a fixed amount of driving.</p><p><b>Know These Types of Evidence in Your Albuquerque Trucking Accident to Help Win Your Case!</b></p><p>If a loved

<p><b>When a New Mexico Trucking Accident Causes a Fatal Fire, All Negligent Parties Can be Liable for the Injuries and Wrongful Deaths</b></p><p>Being trapped in a fire is a nightmare that plagues a lot of people.  And for good reason.  Injuries caused by fire are horribly painful, and burning to death is estimated to be horribly painful.  Unfortunately, this is a real threat in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> due to the high amount of fuel these large commercial trucks hold and obviously the increased number and size of tanker trucks hauling hazardous materials.</p><p>This combination resulted in a horrific pileup trucking accident in a dust storm, which caused a massive fire burning to death 7 victims in passenger vehicles.  The 3 truck drivers, including the tanker that exploded, all walked away unscathed.  The <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, are representing the estate of one of the deceased in a jury trial.  If you or a loved one have been injured or killed in a New Mexico trucking accident, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will help advise you of your rights and how to proceed to protect your rights.</p><p><b>Holding the Negligent Party Liable: Who is at Fault in a Trucking Fire?</b></p><p>If there has been a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">pileup trucking accident,</a> anyone involved in the accident could be liable.  There are some telltale signs of who caused the accident, such as a rear end collision or a driver falling asleep at the wheel, which could trigger the pileup.  That individual will likely be the most culpable.  But any other actor after the initial impact can still be liable.</p><p>Where is gets confusing is if there is a tanker truck involved which explodes or causes a fire.  Even though the other trucks may have originally caused the accident, they did not start the fire.  So does that mean that they are not liable for the fire?</p><p>No, it does not mean the other trucks will not be liable.  The other trucks which started the pileup can absolutely be liable for the ensuing fire, even if they did not start the fire.  This is because they started the negligent accident and act, and the other acts following it could be foreseeable.  Said differently, it is foreseeable that a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">pileup truck accident </a>could result in a fire by at least one of the large commercial vehicles.</p><p>Thus, even if the tanker truck explodes and starts the fire which kills a victim, all of the other trucking companies and drivers will be liable for the burn injuries and wrongful death if they caused or contributed to the pileup trucking accident.  The test is what is foreseeable and whether the tanker truck colliding was a superseding cause of the accident, which is rarely is under these facts.</p><p><b>All Negligent Parties Can be Liable for New Mexico Wrongful Deaths Caused by Fatal Fires, Even if They Did Not Start the Fire</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When Dust Storms Blind New Mexico Drivers, Truck Drivers Are Legally Required to Slow Down</b></p><p>Dust storms blind all drivers, whether that driver is operating a passenger vehicle, motorcycle, or large commercial vehicle.  On interstates, this can result in a very serious hazard where most drivers are driving at a high rate of speed and have limited vision.  When the driver is operating a large commercial vehicle, this can result in serious motor vehicle accidents and easily kill many people.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years ago this recipe of dust storms, interstates, and large commercials killed our client’s loved one and six others.  Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we represent the family of a husband and a father who was burned to death in a New Mexico trucking accident when three large commercial trucks plowed through a dust storm blindly and rear ended several passenger vehicles.  This resulted in a pileup motor vehicle accident and a fire which killed the trapped passengers.  All truck drivers walked away unharmed.  This case is presently going to trial in front of a jury to rectify the rights of the deceased and the family.</p><p><b>New Mexico Law Requires All Drivers to Lower Their Speed to Avoid Causing Accidents with Collisions of Passengers or Other Vehicles</b></p><p>A driver can be liable for a motor vehicle accident due to excessive speed even if he or she is driving under the speed limit.  This is because New Mexico’s speed statute requires motorists to control speed to avoid causing a collision with pedestrians or vehicles.  For instance, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-301/">New Mexico law, NM Stat. 66-7-301</a> provides under subdivision (d) the following:</p><blockquote><p>“In every event, speed shall be so controlled by the driver as may be necessary: (1) to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle or other conveyance on or entering the highway; (2) to comply with legal requirements as may be established by the state highway and transportation department or the New Mexico state police division of department of public safety and the duty of all persons to use due car . . . .”</p></blockquote><p>Thus, a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a> occurring in a dust storm could easily be caused or contributed to by excessive speed.  If you or a loved one have been injured in a New Mexico trucking accident causing by excessive speed in a dust storm, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys</a> today!</p><p><b>Speed Kills, and New Mexico Law Requires Motorists to Slow Down to Avoid Collisions with People or Vehicles</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Dust Storms Lower Visibility and Require Vehicles to Slow Down or Stop, So When a Truck Rear Ends a Passenger Vehicle in a Dust Storm that is Negligent</b></p><p>Dust storms have been in the news a lot lately, particularly the large haboob that blanketed a large area of Arizona.  New Mexico also gets a lot of dust storms which blanket large areas of our state, including on highways and interstates.  All dust storms lower the visibility of drivers on the roadway and make it more difficult to see.  The heavier and worse the dust storm, the more difficult it will be to see.  Heavy dust storms can also lower traction on the road and make it more difficult to stop.  This combination of decreased visibility and traction is a recipe for rear end collisions.</p><p>One ingredient to serious rear end collisions during dust storm is a large commercial vehicle, like a tractor trailer, tanker, semi, 18-wheeler, flatbed, or other big rig.  These large trucks on interstate and highways and be like a blind battering ram during dust storms.  This is why all motorists, especially drivers of large commercial trucks, need to slow down or discontinue driving until the dust storm has passed and it is safe to proceed.  Otherwise the large trucks will kill someone.</p><p><b>Horrific Accident Caused by Gross Negligence </b></p><p>And a few years ago they did.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">The Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> represents the family of a deceased man who was killed during an ongoing dust storm.  He and several other vehicles slowed down during the dust storm as reasonable under the circumstances—particularly given the heavy dust storm.</p><p>Despite low visibility and not being able to see well, three large commercial vehicles—including a tanker with flammable liquids—plowed forward at full speed.  The large commercial trucks rear ended a passenger vehicle and blocked the entire highway.  Instead of putting on their emergency flashers on, the large commercial trucks barricaded the highway and created a pileup.  The tanker driving at full speed although not being able to see crashed into the pileup and exploded.  This resulted in a massive fire, which killed our client and six other passengers.  None of the truck drivers were injured.</p><p><b>So Many Things Wrong, So Little Regard for Human Life</b></p><p>The matter is now at trial in front of a jury as the truck drivers maintain they did nothing wrong.  Yet, there is a laundry list of things they did wrong, which include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/new-mexico-trial-highlights-requirement-for-commercial-trucks-to-slow-down-in-dust-storms/">failing to comply with federal regulations to slow down in dust storms</a>;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/reasons-why-large-commercial-trucks-are-required-to-use-emergency-flashers-after-an-accident/">failing to comply with federal regulations to use their emergency flashers</a>;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/new-mexico-truck-drivers-need-to-use-the-smith-system-of-defensive-driving-to-avoid-dust-storm-accidents/">not employing the Smith System of Defensive Driving</a>;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/cdl-drivers-license-place-extra-burdens-and-requirements-on-new-mexico-truck-drivers-to-be-safe/">forgetting their training and skill tests to get their CDL</a>; and</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/new-mexico-truck-drivers-must-control-speed-during-a-dust-storm/">for not controlling their speed during a weather condition so as to operate their vehicle safely</a>.</li></ul><p>Seven people could easily have been saved if the large commercial trucks followed even half of these regulations and laws.  But even more basically, these commercial trucks rear ended other vehicles which is almost always negligence per se.</p><p><b>New Mexico Law Finds Motorists Who Rear End Other Vehicles Are Almost Always Negligent Per Se For Violating Statutory Law</b></p><p>It is black letter and crystal clear law that a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle closer than is safe.  This law is applicable throughout the United States, and perhaps even the world.  This is codified in New Mexico Law, and quite pointedly provides under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-318/">NM Stat Section 66-7-318</a> that “[t]he driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.”</p><p>Therefore, when a large commercial truck causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a> by following too closely in a dust storm, there will almost always be an automatic finding of negligence under the doctrine of negligence per se.  This doctrine finds a defendant liable for violating a vehicle and traffic law if the law is meant to protect from a certain harm (motor vehicle accident injuries) and meant to protect a certain class of persons (other motorists on the roadway).  Both of these principles clearly apply, and any injuries caused by a rear end car accident are entitled to compensation.</p><p><b>Call Our New Mexico Trucking Accident Attorneys Today if you Have Been Hurt by a Negligence Truck Driver!</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents During Dust Storms can be Prevented by Complying with Federal Regulations and the Smith System of Defensive Driving</b></p><p>Large commercial trucks, tankers, flatbeds, 18-wheelers, semis, big rigs, and other large trucks are all very dangerous vehicles.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> are some of the most devastating accidents out there.  This is true no matter what type of roadway they are on, be it either small local roads or interstate highways.  These large truck vehicles get even more dangerous during dust storms which limit visibility and cause other  problems on the roadway.  This is why federal regulations require large commercial trucks to slow down as reasonable or stop in dust storms.  Further, the Smith System of Defensive Driving teaches students to always aim high on the roadway and look down the road, while also visualizing the entire roadway and ensuring others can see you.</p><p>When large commercial truck drivers fail to comply with the federal regulations and fail to adhere the the preached principles in the Smith System of Defensive Driving, people get hurt or killed.  Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we are representing the estate of a victim killed in a New Mexico trucking accident occurring on Interstate 10 during an ongoing dust storm.  Three large commercial trucks continued to plow down the interstate at a high rate of speed despite not being able to see in the dust storm.  Three passenger vehicles reduced speed as reasonable under the circumstances, and were inevitably rear ended by the truck drivers which continued at full speed.  This caused a large pileup accident, an explosion, and a fatal fire which killed seven passengers; none of the truck drivers were hurt.</p><p>If you or a loved one were involved in a similar type of New Mexico trucking accident, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys are the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> by calling (505) 883-5000.  We will fight for your rights and work hard to get you the maximum amount of compensation you are entitled to—including at trial.  Like the present trial, who burned to death in a trapped motor vehicle and left an entire family which relied on him without a father, we will work zealously and diligently in representing you.</p><p><b>Federal Regulations Require Truck Drivers To Slow Down or Stop in Dust Storms When Visibility is Limited</b></p><p>Trucking is largely interstate, meaning it effects multiple states.  This makes it hard to govern conduct because each state’s laws may be slightly different.  This is why there are federal regulations which set a baseline standard throughout the country, which states may add protections to but usually just keep compliance with the federal regulations.  These regulations are the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, known as the FMCSR</a>.</p><p>The FMCSR promulgated safety regulations which apply in dust storms. Dust storms are very serious weather conditions which create a significant number of New Mexico trucking accidents.  The federal regulations realize this and require “extreme caution” in these conditions.  This is addressed by <a href="http://www.apple.com/">FMCSR section 392.14</a>, which governs hazardous conditions requiring extreme caution, and provides the following:</p><blockquote><p>“Extreme caution in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle shall be exercised when hazardous conditions, such as those caused by . . . dust, or smoke, adversely affect visibility or traction. Speed shall be reduced when such conditions exist. If conditions become sufficiently dangerous, the operation of the commercial motor vehicle shall be discontinued and shall not be resumed until the commercial motor vehicle can be safely operated.”</p></blockquote><p>As you can see from the regulation, it requires large commercial truck drivers to slow down in dust storms which effect visibility.  When the dust storm becomes to dangerous to continue, truck drivers must stop—not speed up or maintain speed like they did in our case.  The reasons are obvious.  If the trucks did slow down, there would have been no accident killing out client.</p><p><b>Smith System of Defensive Driving Prevents Trucking Accidents in Dust Storms</b></p><p>The Smith System of Defensive Driving is a separate system which is not mandatory, but it should be.  All drivers, especially large commercial truck drivers, should take this course.  In essence, the course pushes five main points which are all relevant in dust storms and prevent <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.  They are the following:</p><ol><li>Aim High in Steering, meaning look further down the road at what hazards exist—not just directly in front;</li><li>Look at the Big Picture of the Road, meaning know what is around your vehicle, including ahead, behind, and to the sides;</li><li>Keep Your Eyes Constantly Moving, meaning do not zone out and keep focusing;</li><li>Leave Yourself an Out, meaning do not box yourself in and always have a safe spot to turn to; and</li><li>Make Sure Other Motorists Around You Can See You, meaning ensure others know where you are and what you are doing at all times.</li></ol><p>In dust storms, visibility can be greatly limited.  This means that the Smith System would require drivers to take certain precautions to avoid <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">serious New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.  All of the principles in the Smith System relate to vision and visibility, demonstrating how important this sense is.  When visibility is limited or narrowed to nothing in a dust storm, drivers must slow down to regain their visibility and reaction time or stop traveling all together.</p><p><b>Federal Regulations and the Smith System Would Have Saved Our Client’s Life, and They Could Save Your Life too!</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

When a driver cannot do all of these things, the driver should slow down until all of these things can be done safely.</p><p>Thus, if during a dust storm the driver cannot see everything ahead of him or her, the driver should stop or slow down.  This is particularly true of large commercial truck drivers, who can easily case very serious personal injuries in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><i>New Mexico trucking accidents</i></a>.</p><p><b>Smith System of Safe Driving Can Save Lives in Dust Storms</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>CDL and Smith System of Defensive Driving: A Combination New Mexico Truck Drivers Need to Do to Save Everyone Else’s Lives</b></p><p>All too often we hear about a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accident</a> where multiple people are seriously injured, paralyzed, or killed, but the truck driver walks away without a scratch.  This is partially because truck drivers sit in a large cabin which is higher off the ground and surrounded by a large steel compartment.  However, this is also do to the fact that many trucking companies teach truck drivers certain maneuvers or train drivers how to react in high risk situations to save their lives—not necessarily the lives of others on or near the roadway.</p><p>For instance, a common example is where a truck is unable to stop in time and the driver is trained to just rear end the other vehicle instead of trying to steer away aggressively and possible jackknife or flip and kill more people including the driver.</p><p>Training like this is reactionary and results in the death of many people on or near the roadway.  One such instance is the case being tried by the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, wherein the passenger was killed when three large commercial trucks continued full speed through a dust storm and rear ended several passenger vehicles.  There was a large explosion and a fire which killed seven passengers who burned to death.  None of the truck drivers were injured.</p><p><b>Truck Driver Training Needs to be Precautionary before it needs to be Reactionary to SAVE LIVES</b></p><p>Training needs to be precautionary and preemptive.  Meaning, training needs to prevent truck drivers from being in the position where they will have to choose between jackknifing and rear ending an innocent individual.  That way truck drivers will never have to choose between life and death situations where they place their lives about the lives of others.</p><p>A commercial driver license, or CDL, requires an extensive amount of testing and training before it can be earned pursuant to <a href="http://www.protectingpatientrights.com/blog/what-to-do-if-you-think-you-are-the-victim-of-new-york-medical-malpractice.cfm">federal regulations and requirements</a>.  This includes a test to obtain a commercial learner’s permit, or CLP, and training with an experienced CDL driver before taking the road skills test.  Once passing the road skills test, a CDL applicant will have to submit a 10 year driver’s history to ensure safe driving.  An applicant will also have to certify his or her medical condition and ability to drive.  A further knowledge test is required and the applicant must score more than 80%. There is also another tests skills for the specific vehicle that the CDL applicant is going to operate is also required.  These tests and requirements all ensure that a CDL applicant is driving safe and understands the responsibility of his or her vehicle.</p><p>Even after receiving a CDL, truck drivers should also take, understand, and utilize the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/new-mexico-truck-drivers-need-to-use-the-smith-system-of-defensive-driving-to-avoid-dust-storm-accidents/">Smith System of Defensive Driving which we recently discussed on our last blog post</a>.  This system provides preventative and precautionary conduct which helps keep others safe while on the roads.  This includes the following:</p><ul><li><b>Aim High in Steering </b>– View further down the road, not just what is immediately in front of you;</li><li><b>Stay Alert of Your Surroundings and Look at the Big Picture of the Road</b> – View the entire roadway, including way ahead of you, behind, and to your sides;</li><li><b>Keep Your Eyes Constantly Moving</b> – Don’t zone out and keep moving and analyzing hazards with your eyes constantly scanning;</li><li><b>Leave Yourself an Out</b> – Always have a lane or area to stop, swerve to, or slow down in if you are presented with an immediate hazard—don’t get boxed in; and</li><li><b>Make Sure Other Motorists See You</b> – Most accidents occur when another driver does not see you, so always make sure other motorists see you and know where you are at all times.</li></ul><p><b>Following the Training and Knowledge from the CDL Application Process and the Smith System of Defensive Driver Will Safe the Lives of All Others on the Roadway</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Following the Smith System of Driving a Truck in a Dust Storm Prevents New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Large commercial trucks such as tractor trailers, 18 wheelers, flatbeds, tankers, and other trucks are much more dangerous on roadways than other vehicles.  This is because they are larger, heavier, and more difficult to operate.  This is particularly true on interstates and high ways, where large commercial trucks travel at a high rate of speed and have reduced reaction time but increased stopping distance; this is a recipe for serious injuries.  Combine this with an ongoing dust storm, and there could be <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">very serious New Mexico trucking accidents</a>.</p><p>This is why truck drivers must use the <a href="https://www.drivedifferent.com">Smith System of Safe Driving</a>.  This is system of proven effective methods which make the roads a safer place.  When truck drivers fail to do so, particularly in dust storms, they can cause very serious New Mexico trucking accidents.  This failure occurred in a case handled by the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, which resulted in the deaths of seven passengers in a horrific pileup fatal fire.  Our experienced attorneys are representing the estate of one of those deceased passengers, and presenting the case in a jury trial.  If you or a loved one was injured in a similar accident, or any accident caused by a truck driver, call our office today by dialing (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation!</p><p><b>Understanding the Smith System of Safe Driving</b></p><p>The Smith System of Safe Driving is a bible for all truck drivers—really for all motorists.  But it is particularly important for truck drivers to use this system, especially in inclement weather such as dust storms.  There are five principles preached by the Smith System of Safe Driving, which include the following:</p><ol><li><b>Aim High in Steering</b> – This means that drivers must pay attention to not what is just immediately in front of them, but must further down the road.  Drivers must view the road in its entirety, looking for hazards well in front so the driver can begin to react now, not just when the hazard is right in front.</li><li><b>Stay Alert of Your Surroundings and Look for the Big Picture</b> – Building on the first principle, a driver needs to have the whole picture of the roadway.  What is ahead, to the sides, and behind the driver is very important to understand.  A driver needs to be able to visualize everything around him or her to ensure he or she can avoid any and all accidents.</li><li><b>Keep Your Eyes Constantly Moving and Don’t Stare or Zone out</b> – Constantly moving your eyes prevents your body from entering into a relaxed state or trance.  It will force you to stay alert and keep your attention on the road and hazards around the roadway.</li><li><b>Leave Yourself an Out </b>– Leaving yourself an out means not boxing yourself into a dangerous situation.  It means to also have a safe or empty location on the roadway where you can go to avoid a collision or hazard.</li><li><b>Make Sure Other Motorist See You at All Times</b> – Making sure other drivers can see you is very important.  It will help other drivers manage their blind spots and be aware of you before they make any maneuvers like a lane change or turn.  If you are unsure that another driver can see you, act like they cannot see you and take every precaution to guard against a movement or maneuver which may put you in danger.</li></ol><p>Thus, in a dust storm, if a truck driver complies with the Smith System of Safe Driving he or she can avoid any accident.  These principles would require a truck driver to slow down and leave an out.  To stop if he or she cannot see ahead of him or her.  To use emergency flashers or a horn if he or she is not sure that other drivers can see the truck.  These are important principles that would have saved the life of our client in the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><b>fatal New Mexico trucking accident </b></a>presently at trial.</p><p><b>Smith System of Safe Driving Can Save Lives in Dust Storms</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When a Dust Storm Limits Visibility, New Mexico Truck Drivers Must Reduce Speed to Prevent Accidents</b></p><p>Dust storms can wreck havoc on a highway or interstate.  This is dangerous because motor vehicle driving on highways or interstates are traveling at a high rate of speed.  The reduction in visibility due to the dust storm and the increase in stopping distance due to the high speed is a recipe for serious motor vehicle accidents.  This is particularly true when large commercial trucks are involved in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> during dust storms while on interstates.</p><p>The <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking attorneys</a> at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> are bringing a matter to trial where this recipe for disaster occurred and resulted in the death of seven people.  There was an ongoing dust storm on Interstate 10, and several passenger vehicles slowed down as reasonable under the circumstances of the dust storm.  However, despite the limited visibility, three large trucks continued to plow forward at full speed.  Given the limited visibility and increased stopping distance, the large tractor trailers rear ended the passenger vehicles.  This blocked a portion of Interstate 10, causing several other vehicles to crash into the pileup.  This resulted in an explosion and large fire, causing the death of all seven occupants of the passenger vehicles.  None of the truck drivers were seriously injured or killed.</p><p>The matter is in front of a New Mexico jury seeking damages for the wrongful death of our client.  If you or a loved one have been injured or killed in a similar New Mexico trucking accident, call us today and speak with our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced trucking accident attorneys</a>.  We will advise you of your rights in a FREE consultation, and help you move forward with your claim and your life.  Call us today at (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Large Commercial Trucks Need to Reduce Speed when Visibility is Limited in a Dust Storm, Even if this Means to Half of the Posted Speed Limit!</b></p><p>Most drivers on the highway or interstate travel around or at—even above—the speed limit.  While in ideal conditions this may be acceptable, when there is a dust storm limiting visibility, it can result in limited visibility.  Under New Mexico law, the weather conditions limiting visibility would require a motorist to reduce and control his or her speed on the interstate so as to avoid colliding with another vehicle.</p><p>Specifically, this is governed by <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-301/">New Mexico Stat. 66-7-301</a>, which requires “[i]n every event, speed shall be controlled by the driver as may be necessary to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle or other conveyance on or entering the highway.”  Thus, in a dust storm a large commercial truck would be required to slow down on the interstate.  This could mean only lowering the speed by 15 MPH, but this could mean lowering speed to 15 MPH in total.  The standard is avoiding collisions with other vehicles.</p><p><b>New Mexico Trucks Must Control Speed During Dust Storms</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient Contact box located by clicking here.</p>

<p><b>Federal Regulations Require Truck Drivers to SLOW DOWN in New Mexico Dust Storms</b></p><p>It would be very hard to operate a motor vehicle without being able to see where you are going.  In fact, sight is the most important sense required to drive a motor vehicle.  This is particularly true when the motor vehicle is a commercial truck such as an 18-wheeler, flatbed, tanker, tractor trailer, or other large truck.  And even more important when the large commercial truck is being driven on a highway or interstate at speeds above 55 MPH, 65 MPH, or even faster.  Vision is paramount to safety on these fast roadways.</p><p>This is why federal regulations require large commercial trucks to slow down or stop when visibility is limited in a dust storm.  The inability to see where a large commercial truck is going can be fatal if the truck continues to travel on the highway or interstate at full speed.  Especially when other motor vehicles slow down as reasonable under the circumstances given the limited visibility.  This is a recipe for a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>.  Unfortunately, this is what happened to the victim represented by the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</p><p><b>Tragic Death Due to Negligent New Mexico Truck Drivers</b></p><p>Our client was traveling on Interstate 10 in a passenger vehicle when he entered into an ongoing dust storm.  He and several other passenger vehicles on the roadway slowed down as necessary in the limited visibility.  They proceeded in a slow, controlled, and safe manner.  However, three large commercial trucks did not slow down and continued to plow forward at full speed without being able to fully see where they were going.  This resulted in a rear end collision which blocked a portion of the roadway.  This caused a pileup accident involving the three trucks and three passenger vehicles, which resulted in an explosion and massive fire.</p><p>While the three truck drivers were able to walk away from the <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking accident</a>, seven passengers—including the victim represented by the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.—burned to death in the fire.  Now, our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> are about to start the trial to protect the victim’s family and get them the compensation they desire for the loss of their breadwinner and loved one.  But had the truck drivers following the federal regulations, this accident never would have happened.</p><p><b>If Truck Drivers Followed Federal Regulations, This Accident Would Not Have Happened!</b></p><p>While most state laws are different and unique, and most trucking companies operate through multiple states even for just a simple or short delivery, there is an extensive matrix of federal trucking regulations which help unify the way large commercial trucks are to operate on roadways.  These regulations require trucking companies and truck drivers act a certain way and operate their massive vehicles in a certain way.</p><p>This includes slowing down or stopping in dust storms when the weather conditions are too extreme to continue traveling.  Under <a href="http://www.apple.com/">FMCSR section 392.14</a>, which governs hazardous conditions requiring extreme caution, it provides that “[e]xtreme caution in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle shall be exercised when hazardous conditions, such as those caused by . . . dust, or smoke, adversely affect visibility or traction.

<p><b>Dust Storms Can Cause Serious Rear End Car Accidents in Albuquerque, New Mexico</b></p><p>In New Mexico, highways and Interstates are made more dangerous in dust storms.  Visibility is limited and traction can be reduced in bad storms.  Both of these conditions are factors in causing rear end car accidents.  On highways or Interstates, rear end car accidents can be particularly dangerous and deadly—especially when large commercial trucks are involved like 18-wheelers, semis, and tankers.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we are representing the family of a victim in a rear end New Mexico trucking accident caused during a dust storm.  Our client was traveling in an ongoing dust storm and slowed down as reasonable under the circumstances.  However, 3 large commercial trucks continued to plow forward blindly in the ongoing dust storm.  This resulted in a large pileup collision resulting in a devastating fire killing seven passengers in several other cars, including our client.  The tragedy is horrific and totally avoidable.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in a New Mexico car accident caused by a rear end collision in a dust storm, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced attorneys</a> today at (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation!  We will advise you on your rights and help protect your rights to compensation from a serious motor vehicle accident!</p><p><b>Dust Storms Causing Albuquerque Rear End Car Accidents</b></p><p>What makes dust storms so dangerous is that they reduce visibility and can even completely blind motorists.  This is particularly scary on highways and Interstates where fast-driving vehicles can become unguided missiles.  Large commercial trucks take even longer to slow down due to their massive size which requires a longer distance to stop.  The decreased visibility and increased stopping distance make <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">large commercial trucks in dust storms a recipe for serious motor vehicle accidents</a>.</p><p>This is why federal regulations require commercial trucks to slow down as reasonable in dust storms, and even come to a complete stop if commercial trucks cannot safely travel during the dust storm.  For instance, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">FMCSR section 392.14</a> provides that “[e]xtreme caution in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle shall be exercised when hazardous conditions, such as those caused by . . . dust, or smoke, adversely affect visibility or traction. Speed shall be reduced when such conditions exist. If conditions become sufficiently dangerous, the operation of the commercial motor vehicle shall be discontinued and shall not be resumed until the commercial motor vehicle can be safely operated.”</p><p>If a large commercial truck fails to slow down or stop under this federal regulation and rear ends another vehicle, the truck driver could result in liability for the victim under New Mexico law.  For instance, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-318/">NM Stat Section 66-7-318</a> provides that “[t]he driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.”  Thus, a commercial truck which rear ends another vehicle may result in liability under this law.</p><p>In addition, if a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">large commercial truck needs to stop or is involved in a motor vehicle accident</a>, it must use its emergency flashers to prevent other vehicles from not seeing it and rear ending the stopped or disabled truck.  Under <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/title49/section/392.22">FMCSA section 392.22</a>, a commercial trucking vehicle must use hazard warning signal flashers “[w]henever a commercial motor vehicle is stopped upon the traveled portion of a highway or the shoulder of a highway for any cause other than necessary traffic stops, the driver of the stopped commercial motor vehicle shall immediately activate the vehicular hazard warning signal flashers and continue the flashing until the driver places the warning devices . . . .”</p><p><b>Albuquerque Car Accidents in Dust Storms Caused by Rear End Car Accidents Require Legal Representation!</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Federal Regulations Require Commercial Trucks to Use Flashers When Stopped on Roadways, Which Includes After New Mexico Trucking Accidents in Dust Storms </b></p><p>Commercial trucks are very dangerous motor vehicles, particularly on highways and interstates where they become battering rams.  When there are severe dust storms which limit visibility, or even blind drivers, large commercial trucks can become unguided missiles on highway and interstates.  This can make them even more deadly in <a href="http://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a>, particularly to smaller passenger vehicles.</p><p>One very dangerous situation is when commercial trucks crash in a dust storm due to limited vision.  Yet, these commercial trucks fail to mitigate the accident and continue to remain hidden on the highway and interstate for other vehicles traveling on the roads.  This is why federal regulations require stopped commercial trucks to turn on their emergency flashers to help make themselves visible on roadway to prevent <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">pileup trucking accidents</a>.</p><p>Here at the <a href="http://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we represent the estate of a man killed in a serious <a href="http://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a> caused by a dust storm and truck drivers who failed to activate their emergency flashers after an accident.  Instead of complying with federal regulations, these commercial truck drivers turned a dangerous situation into a deadly situation.  They created a trap on one of the busiest Interstates in New Mexico, almost guaranteeing to kill many other people—and that they did.  If you or a loved one have also been injured in a New Mexico trucking accident similar to this, call us today for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Federal Trucking Regulations Requiring Emergency Flashers for Commercial Trucks After an Accident</b></p><p>There are many federal regulations which help govern the conduct of commercial trucking companies and truck drivers that travel across the United States.  One of the more important provisions is <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/title49/section/392.22">FMCSA section 392.22</a>, which governs emergency signals for stopped commercial motor vehicles.  Under <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/title49/section/392.22">subdivision (a)</a>, commercial trucking vehicle must use hazard warning signal flashers: “Whenever a commercial motor vehicle is stopped upon the traveled portion of a highway or the shoulder of a highway for any cause other than necessary traffic stops, the driver of the stopped commercial motor vehicle shall immediately activate the vehicular hazard warning signal flashers and continue the flashing until the driver places the warning devices . . . .”</p><p>Therefore, commercial trucking vehicles involved in a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accident on a highway or Interstate</a> must use their hazard flashers to ensure that other vehicles can see them on the roadway.  In the case our <a href="http://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> are handling, the failure of two trucks to use their emergency hazard flashers during a dust storm concealed them and resulted in a deadly pileup collision with another truck and three passenger vehicles.  If the drivers used their flashers, the additional accidents may have been avoided.</p><p><b>Trucking Accidents Caused by Dust Storms Can Kill and Emergency Flashers Can Help Avoid these Accidents</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="http://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Tractor Trailers and Dust Storms are a Deadly Combination for New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Large commercial trucks such as tractor trailers, flatbeds, semis, 18-wheelers, and other trucks are dangerous motor vehicles even in optimal conditions.  When there is an ongoing dust storm, these motor vehicles can become unguided missiles which will destroy whatever they collide in.  Unfortunately, this generally means they will collide with passenger vehicles.  This is particularly dangerous when this occurs on an Interstate or highway.</p><p>Here at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we are representing the victim of a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a> which occurred during a dust storm and on Interstate 10.  Even though the dust storm nearly blinded the tractor truck drivers, they continued going full speed ahead and collided into three passenger vehicles causing a large explosion.  This case is going to trial and will help compensation the victim’s family who have endured serious emotional pain and financial harm when their loved one was killed.</p><p>If you or a loved one have similarly been the victim of a serious <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident caused in a dust storm</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at our office for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will help advise you of your rights and take steps to ensure you obtain the maximum compensation you may be entitled to.</p><p><b>Reasons Why Large Commercial Trucks are Dangerous on Interstates </b></p><p>The sheer size, weight, and speed make large commercial trucks on Interstates or highways a battering ram.  The heavy weight and speed create a lot of momentum which must be completely disbursed when the tractor trailer truck stops.  If the tractor trailer truck impacts with an object, such as a passenger vehicle, all of that momentum is transferred from the speeding truck and into the passenger vehicle and any passengers therein.  This can cause <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">absolutely catastrophic and debilitating injuries or death in a trucking accident</a>.</p><p>Additionally, large commercial trucks on Interstates also travel at a high rate of speed.  These means that the distance required to stop the tractor trailer truck increased because of the trucks momentum.  This also means that, due to the faster speed, the amount of time a driver has to react decreases because the truck is moving faster.  This combination of increased stopping distance and decreased reaction time adds to the recipe for serious <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents on Interstates or highways</a>.</p><p><b>Dust Storms on Interstates Can Cause Deadly New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Dust storms decrease visibility because they darken the sky and throw particles (sand, debris) in the air making it more difficult for motorists to see where they are going.  Dust storms can come on quickly, but many times there are warning signs of dust storms such as an ongoing cloud, increasing winds, and even just weather reports forecasting the storms.  Additionally, dust storms start slowly and get worse.</p><p>Thus, when motorists are traveling through the start of a dust storm on an Interstate or highway, they need to begin to plan what to do to keep themselves and others on or near the roadway safe.  This includes slowing down as reasonable under the circumstances, pulling to the side of the road, using flashers, or even pulling off the road and coming to a stop until the storm passes.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/federal-regulations-require-new-mexico-trucking-companies-to-exercise-extreme-caution-in-dust-storms/">Federal trucking regulations even require large commercial trucks take these precautions</a>.</p><p>When large commercial trucks continue to plow through a dust storm on the Interstate or a highway during a dust storm, they can be risking serious personal injury to others on or near the roadway.  This can result in horrific injuries and even death and the <a

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accident Attorney Discusses Safety Rules to Protect the Public in Dust Storms</b></p><p>We all know that operating a motor vehicle involves many rules, laws, regulations, guidelines, and other authority which govern our conduct.  From stopping at a stop sign to knowing when to yield in a roundabout, there are established rules of the road which we all know and abide by—sometimes without even thinking twice about it!  Most of these are safety rules to protect the public from harm.</p><p>Some of the most important safety rules to protect the public from harm are the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations</a>.  These regulations impose extra precautions and requirements on large commercial trucks, semi, 18-wheelers, flatbeds, tractor trailers, and other large trucks.  When a trucking company or trucking driver violate these regulations and cause a New Mexico trucking accident, this can be evidence of negligence to help a victim recover compensation for his or her injuries.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a> caused by a trucking company or truck driver, contact the experienced trucking accident attorney at the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will investigate your claim to determine whether a safety rule meant to protect the public has been violated by the trucking company or trucking driver.  We provide FREE consultations, so do not delay and call us today!</p><p><b>Safety Rules to Protect the Public in Dust Storms: Truck Drivers Must Exercise “Extreme Caution”</b></p><p>The <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, known as the FMCSR</a>, have promulgated safety regulations for extreme weather such as dust storms.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/can-new-mexico-car-accidents-during-a-haboob-or-dust-storm-create-liability/">Earlier this week we noted how dangerous haboobs (massive dust storms)</a> can be for motorists, particularly on highways.  The results can be absolutely devastating, particularly for motorists involved in trucking accidents.</p><p>This danger is contemplated and addressed by <a href="http://www.apple.com">FMCSR section 392.14</a>, which governs hazardous conditions requiring extreme caution.  <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/title49/section/392.14">This section provides the following</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Extreme caution in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle shall be exercised when hazardous conditions, such as those caused by . . . dust, or smoke, adversely affect visibility or traction. Speed shall be reduced when such conditions exist. If conditions become sufficiently dangerous, the operation of the commercial motor vehicle shall be discontinued and shall not be resumed until the commercial motor vehicle can be safely operated.”</p></blockquote><p>Thus, this regulation requires a commercial trucking driver to slow down to help him or her handle the decreased disability and traction on the roadway.  If the reduction of speed does not help enough and the traveling is still too dangerous, the commercial trucking driver must discontinue and shall not resume driving until the truck can be safety operated.  The goal is to prevent <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> in inclement weather.</p><p><b>Failure to Comply with FMCSR Section 392.14 Can Result in Death!</b></p><p>Here at the <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">Caruso Law Offices, P.C., we represent the victim</a> of a massive pileup on Interstate 10 who perished in a fire caused when three large commercial trucks crashed into three passenger vehicles during a dust storm.  Even though there was a massive dust storm almost completely blinding all motorists on the roadway, the three truck drivers continued to plow down the highway at full speed and into our client’s vehicle.  If the truck drivers complied with this section of law, our client would not have been killed.</p><p><b>Violations of Federal Trucking Regulations in Dust Storms Can Result in Liability</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Phoenix Arizona’s Recent Massive Haboob Brings Lessons to <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Car Accidents</a> Caused By Dust Storms</b></p><p>It has been all over the national news that Phoenix, Arizona has just been engulfed by massive haboob.  A “haboob” is a large dust storm characterized by violent and high winds blowing sand into the area.  While its effects were not heavily felt in New Mexico, we are just as susceptible to these types of powerful weather phenomena.  These storms are dangerous for both pedestrians and motorists alike, particularly when people do not exercise the degree of caution required to handle these dangerous storms.</p><p>Here at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know that dust storms like a haboob can create blinding walls of dust and impair a driver’s vision.  This can cause serious <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Motor Vehicle Accidents</a> resulting in debilitating and deadly injuries.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> have handled many motor vehicle accidents caused by limited or constrained vision.  If you or a loved one have been injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Car Accident</a> caused during a dust storm, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will help protect your rights to compensation caused by another’s negligence during a dust storm.</p><p><b>Car Crashes During Dust Storms: New Mexico Car Accident Liability Under Statutory Law</b></p><p>While there is common law (judge-made law) that requires all motorists to see what there is to be seen in the use or operation of a motor vehicle, there are also two powerful New Mexico statutes that can help win your case.</p><p>First, there is <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-301/">New Mexico Stat. 66-7-301 which governs speed regulation</a>, and requires “[i]n every event, speed shall be controlled by the driver as may be necessary to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle or other conveyance on or entering the highway.”  This means if a driver cannot see due to a dust storm such as a haboob, he or she must slow down in an effort to control his or her vehicle to avoid an accident.  If a driver continues to drive too fast and causes a car accident during a dust storm, this can result in liability entitling the victim to recover compensation.</p><p>Second, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-318/">New Mexico Stat. 66-7-318</a> governs following too closely (tailgating), and provides that a “driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.”  The phrase “condition of the highway” would include limited visibility due to a haboob or dust storm.  If a car accident is caused by a driver following too closely during a strong dust storm, he or she may be liable for the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a> and for all injuries to the victim or victims.</p><p><b>New Mexico Car Accidents Caused by a Haboob or Dust Storm Can Bring Liability</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident due to a dust storm or haboob, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Airbag Injuries Can Be Caused in Albuquerque Car Accidents Due to Various Factors</b></p><p>Airbags are one of the most important safety devices in a motor vehicle.  Unfortunately, sometimes they cause more damage than good.  This could be because of a defect in the airbag, such as deploying too late, too fast or powerful, improperly opening up, or failing to deploy all together.  Additionally, airbags could actually cause worse injuries than may have occurred without them, such as being triggered in a non life-threatening but causing injuries that would not have occurred otherwise.</p><p>If you or a loved one were injured in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accident</a>, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> if you think an airbag caused or contributed to your injuries.  Every single car accident needs to be investigated so it can be determined whether the airbag was a contributing factor in your car accident.  In addition to finding the negligent driver who caused your injuries, you may also be entitled to compensation from your vehicle’s auto-manufacturer or repair company.  Call us today for a FREE consultation by calling (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Common Causes of Defective Airbag Injuries </b></p><p>There is no question that airbags safe lives and do more good than harm.  But sometimes, an airbag could be the cause—sometimes even the sole cause—of an injury to the victim of an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accident</a>.  Some common causes of airbag injuries include the following:</p><p><i>Failure to Deploy</i> – sometimes an airbag does not deploy when it is supposed to, which can result in serious personal injuries that an airbag could have prevented.  This is particularly dangerous when there is a serious or high speed collision which the driver relies on the airbag to help mitigate or prevent injuries.</p><p><i>Too fact or Powerful Deployment</i> – sometimes instead of not deploying the airbag actually deploys too quickly and too powerfully.  This could be because the airbag was overpacked with its charge, or defectively manufactured with a design defect or individual product defect.  Injuries in an excessively powerful airbag can cause significant head and facial injuries.</p><p><i>Late Deployment</i><i> – </i>What can even be the worst is when the airbag deploys late, thus propelling the victim into the apparatus which could cause injuries like the steering wheel or dashboard before deploying and causing additional injuries.  This can also be very dangerous because the victim could be closer to the steering wheel than he or she should be when the airbag deploys, causing serious injury.</p><p><b>Common Injuries Caused by Airbags in Albuquerque Car Accidents</b></p><p>In addition to the injuries which could normally be caused by a car accident, sometimes airbags can cause serious injuries by virtue of just deploying.  Remember, there is an explosive charge in every airbag.  This is a serious force that comes out to protect a car accident victim.  Usually an airbag does its job, but sometimes it does not.</p><p>When an airbag does not do its job very well, it can cause the following injuries:</p><ul><li>Facial injuries such as lacerations, bruising, and other damage;</li><li>Severe head trauma;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/"><i>Traumatic brain injuries</i></a>;</li><li>Eye injuries, such as partial or complete blindness;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/understanding-spinal-cord-injuries-caused-by-a-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accident/"><i>Spinal cord injuries</i></a>;</li><li>Whiplash injuries;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/types-of-broken-bones-in-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accidents/"><i>Broken bones, such as orbital blowout fractures</i></a>;</li><li>Paraplegia or quadriplegia;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/nerve-injuries-in-albuquerque-car-accidents/"><i>Nerve injuries or damage</i></a>;</li><li>Hearing loss of damage;</li><li>Broken noses or nose injuries;</li><li>Loss of hair due to scarring;</li><li>Loss of sense of smell due to trauma;</li><li>Loss of teeth or fractured teeth; and</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/"><i>Death</i></a>.</li></ul><p><b>Airbag Injuries Caused by Albuquerque Car Accidents Should be Investigated by Us!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident due to an airbag injury, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>When Inclement Weather Causes an Albuquerque Car Accident, the Victim Can Still Recover Compensation</b></p><p>There can be many different causes of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accidents</a>.  Most of them are driver error, such as distracted driving, following too closely, or speeding.  These can be preventable and are commonly caused by the negligence of a driver.  Other types of car accidents can be caused by factors not in the control of the driver, such as the weather.  However, car accidents car by the weather can still be preventable and still be caused by negligence.</p><p>Here at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a>, we know that all motor vehicle accidents need to be investigated to discover the root cause of the crash.  This is particularly true of weather conditions which may contribute to a car accident, but such accident could still be avoidable by the other driver.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured in a New Mexico car accident where the other driver claims the weather was the cause, call our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced attorneys</a> today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We will review your case and advise you how to protect your rights to compensation!</p><p><b>Common Law Negligence in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque Car Accidents</a> Caused by Weather Conditions</b></p><p>Whether it is rain, fog, wind, dust, or other serious weather conditions, all drivers must exercise due care in the use and operation of their vehicle.  It goes without saying that when the weather is bad, a driver needs to be more careful—this is obvious.  This means when visibility is limited or the ability to stop or maneuver one’s vehicle is made more difficult, a driver must slow down and regain more control of his or her vehicle to avoid an accident.</p><p>This duty of reasonable care is under a theory of negligence, and is part of the common law (or judge-made law).  When a driver breaches this duty of reasonable care and such breach causes damages, the driver will be liable for such damages.  This allows a victim to recover compensation for any injuries caused in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident due to a driver’s negligence</a> during inclement weather.</p><p><b>Automatically Negligent for Causing Certain Albuquerque Car Accidents Caused by the Weather</b></p><p>In addition to the judge-made common law, a driver who violates a statute and causes harm to an individual that statute is meant to protect and prevent that harm, a driver may be found automatically negligent as a matter of law.  This is called negligence per se, and it is a very important theory of liability that a victim of a car accident can use.</p><p>Therefore, the violation of a statute which causes a car accident can result in negligence.  For instance, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-301/">New Mexico Stat. 66-7-301 governs speed regulation</a>, and requires “[i]n every event, speed shall be controlled by the driver as may be necessary to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle or other conveyance on or entering the highway.”  This means if a driver cannot see due to a dust storm or heavy rain, he or she must slow down and control his or her vehicle to remain in control and able to avoid an accident.  If a driver causes a car accident due to losing control, skidding, or not being able to stop in time because he or she was going too fast in inclement weather, he or she may be negligent per se under this statute.</p><p>In addition, <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-318/">New Mexico Stat. 66-7-318</a> governs following too closely, and provides that “[t]he driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.”  This means if the condition of the highway is wet or there is a dust storm or heavy fog limiting vision, a driver must slow down to avoid causing a car accident.  If a car accident is caused by a driver following too closely for the condition of the highway, he or she may be liable for the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a> under the doctrine of negligence per se.</p><p><b>Did Inclement Weather Contribute to an Albuquerque Car Accident Where You Were Injured?  Call Us today!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle

<p><b>Victims Injured in a New Mexico Car Accident Caused by a Defendant Texting While Driving May be Entitled to Compensation</b></p><p>We all know that texting while driving is very dangerous.  In recent years, this has become a more prolific problem and organizations such as <a href="http://www.enddd.org">End Distracting Driving</a> have created aggressive campaigns to raise awareness.  This is because driving while texting pulls a driver’s attention away from driving, a hand away from the steering wheel, and a driver’s eyes off the road.  Essentially, this causes a motor vehicle to become an unguided missile on the road which can cause serious injuries to all on or around the road.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">seriously injured or killed by a driver texting while driving</a>, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. </a>to learn about your rights.  Our attorneys know how deadly distract driving can be, and the physical, emotional, and financial burdens a car accident can place on a person and his or her family.  We will help ease those burdens while you focus on your recovery.  Contact us today for a FREE case evaluation by calling (505) 883-5000!</p><p><b>Texting While Driving is Illegal in Many States, Including New Mexico!</b></p><p>While it is a known danger, texting while driving has only recently become illegal in most states.  New Mexico’s legislature has enacted laws prohibiting texting while driving.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">New Mexico Stat. 66-7-374, subdivision (a)</a> provides that “[a] person shall not read or view a text message or manually type on a handheld mobile communication device for any purpose while driving a motor vehicle, except to summon medical or other emergency help . . . .“</p><p><a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">Subdivision (c)</a> defines “driving” as “being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway or street including being temporarily stopped because of traffic, a traffic light, or stop sign or otherwise . . . .”  However, this does not include pulling off to the side of the road or off an active roadway.</p><p><b>If Another Driver Violates New Mexico Law, He or She May be Negligent Per Se</b></p><p>Although texting while driving could result in a finding of negligence under the common law (judge made law), an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorney</a> knows how to apply the doctrine of negligence per se against a defendant.</p><p>The doctrine of negligence per se allows an injured plaintiff to hold a defendant automatically negligence by violating a statute, causing a harm meant to be protected by the statute (i.e., injuries from car accidents), and causing such harm to a person protected by the statute (i.e., other people on or off the roadway).</p><p>A defendant who causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a> because he or she was texting while driving would likely be negligent per se for any damages he or she caused.</p><p><b>Injured in a New Mexico Car Accident Caused by a Driver Texting, Call Us Today!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident caused by a person texting while driving, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Head on Collisions Can Cause Devastating Injuries and Debilitating Conditions</b></p><p>One of the most devastating types of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accidents</a> is the head on collision.  Almost nothing can be more destructive than two forces traveling in opposite directions and colliding.  This is especially true on high-speed limit roadways, such as interstates and highways.  Further, this is particularly true when a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">tractor trailer, semi, 18-wheeler, or other large commercial truck</a> is one of the vehicles involved in the head on collision.  Thus, <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">head on trucking accidents</a> are some of the deadliest.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been involved in a head on collision, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation by calling (505) 883-5000.  We have handled many car accidents caused by head on collisions which have resulted in catastrophic injuries.  We know that personal injuries caused in such catastrophic car accidents can cause significant impacts on not just the victim, but his or her entire family.  Don’t delay, and call us today!</p><p><b>Common Causes of Head On Car Accidents</b></p><p>Generally when there is a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">head on car accident</a>, one driver is at fault.  This is because roadways are constructed in such a way to avoid head on collisions.  Thus, head on car accidents are usually caused when a driver fails to follow the rules of the road or the signage on the roadway.  Essentially, this means head on car accident are caused by the negligence of one driver.  Common causes of head on car accidents include the following:</p><ul><li>Distracted driving, including texting, cell phone use, using the GPS, and playing with the radio;</li><li>Drunk driving;</li><li>Excess speed;</li><li>Improper left turn;</li><li>Running a stop sign or red light;</li><li>Failing to yield;</li><li>Crossing the centerline;</li><li>Unsafe passing;</li><li>Failure to handle a curve;</li><li>Falling asleep at the wheel;</li><li>and many other causes.</li></ul><p><b>Common Types of Injuries in Head On Car Accidents</b></p><p>Since both vehicles are traveling in different directions, the impact can be absolutely catastrophic due to the two opposing forces.  This creates a very serious and significant impact.  The impact forces get transferred into the occupants of the motor vehicles involved in the collision.  This can cause very serious personal injuries, including the following:</p><p>•<a href="https://carusolaw.com/types-of-broken-bones-in-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accidents/">Broken bones, including broken legs and arms</a>;</p><p>•Amputations, particularly hands or feet;</p><p>•<a href="https://carusolaw.com/understanding-spinal-cord-injuries-caused-by-a-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accident/">Spinal cord injuries</a>;</p><p>•Fractured vertebrae;</p><p>•Need for a total knee replacement;</p><p>•<a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries</a>;</p><p>•Paralysis;</p><p>•Need for spinal fusion surgery;</p><p>•Bulging discs or ruptured disc;</p><p>•Organ damage, including ruptures or collapsed lungs;</p><p>•Injuries to the eyes;</p><p>•Knee injuries, including need for arthroscopic surgery for a damaged or torn meniscus, ACL, MCL, PCL, LCL;</p><p>•Lacerations and significant scars;</p><p>•Shoulder injuries, including need for arthroscopic surgery for a torn rotator cuff or labrum;</p><p>•Need for a total shoulder replacement;</p><p>•Need for painkillers;</p><p>•Need for cortisone or pain medication injections;</p><p>•<a href="https://carusolaw.com/nerve-injuries-in-albuquerque-car-accidents/">Nerve injuries</a>;</p><p>•<a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">Wrongful death</a>; and</p><p>•Many other injuries.</p><p><b>Injured in a Head On Car Accident?

<p><b>Can a Trucking Company be Liable for a Truck Driver’s Negligence in an Albuquerque Trucking Accident?</b></p><p>When a truck driver causes an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking accident</a> because he or she falls asleep while driver, speeds above the limit, fails to secure the cargo properly, drives distracted, or acts in another negligent manner, the results can be devastating.  Any trucking accident, even at low speeds, can cost catastrophic and debilitating personal injuries to victims. Even though it appears that the truck driver was the only negligent party, it is common for the trucking company to also be negligent as a matter of law.</p><p>If you have been injured by a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">negligent truck driver causing an Albuquerque trucking accident</a>, the <a href="/">experienced attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. </a>can help you get the compensation you deserve by holding the trucking company also liable for your injuries.  We know how the principles of vicarious liability and respondeat superior work to a victim’s benefit.  Call us today for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Trucking Companies CAN BE Liable for a Truck Driver’s Negligence Because of Vicarious Liability!</b></p><p>Anytime a truck driver is <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">negligent for an Albuquerque trucking accident</a>, the trucking company may also be liable under the theory of vicarious liability.  The doctrine of vicarious liability comes from the ancient theory of law known as respondeat superior, which is where the master is liable for the acts of the agent.  In modern term, it is more accurately translated that the employer is liable for the acts of the employee.</p><p>Thus, when a truck driver employed by a trucking company is negligent in causing a trucking accident, as long as the truck driver is acting on behalf and in further of the trucking company, the trucking company will also be liable.  Said differently, if the truck driver causes a trucking accident while in the scope of employment, the trucking company will also be liable for the same negligence—even though the trucking company is not driving the truck!</p><p>The theory of vicarious liability allows the <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">victim of an Albuquerque trucking accident</a> to seek compensation from the trucking company.  Since most driver do not have enough insurance coverage and are unable to pay for thousands of medical expenses, attaching liability against the trucking company will ensure a victim can receive just compensation.</p><p><b>Trucking Companies CAN ALSO Be Liable Under a SEPARATE Theory of Liability for Negligent Hiring, Training, or Equipment Defects</b></p><p>While at first instance it may appear that the only negligence is the bad driving, there are other theories of liability which may not be so obvious but equally important.  In fact, some theories may actually be independent and separate causes of action!</p><p><i>Negligent Hiring</i> – when a trucking company hires a truck driver whom is unfit to operate a motor vehicle, let alone a very difficult motor vehicle such as a tractor trailer, semi, 18-wheeler, or other commercial vehicle, the trucking company may be liable for the bad hire;</p><p><i>Negligent Training </i>– when a trucking company improperly trains a truck driver by giving him or her bad training such as bad advice, wrong instructions, or simply improper policies, the trucking company may be liable if such improper training is the cause of the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><i>trucking accident.</i></a>  This includes if the trucking company instructed the truck driver how to incorrectly make turns, improperly stop the vehicle, or do other dangerous or reckless maneuvers that cause the accident.</p><p><i>Equipment defects</i><i> – </i>while a driver is always responsible for the vehicle in which he or she operates, the trucking company may be solely liable for the upkeep of the truck.  This is particularly true if the truck has latent, or hidden, defects such as tire defects, brake defects, steering wheel issues, or is improperly loaded.</p><p><b>Trucking Companies CAN BE Liable for Albuquerque Trucking Accidents </b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Understanding Car Insurance After a New Mexico Car Accident</b></p><p>One of the first questions a person injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a> may ask is how is he or she going to pay for her medical expenses and vehicle damage.  These expenses can quickly accumulate and grow very large very quickly.  It can become very overwhelming to pay for these new bills when an injured victim may be unable to get to work.</p><p>However, every resident who drives a motor vehicle in New Mexico is required under New Mexico’s laws requiring car insurance.  This is primarily how an injured victim of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a> will get compensation for his or her injuries and for property damage.  Therefore if you or a loved one have been injured in a motor vehicle accident, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation by calling (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Understanding New Mexico’s Car Insurance Laws</b></p><p>There is no national standard relating to car insurance.  Therefore, states can either be a “no-fault” or “fault” state.  New Mexico is a “fault” state, which means that the driver held responsible for the damages caused by a car accident is required to pay for such damages.  Thus, the at-fault driver’s car insurance will pay for the victim’s damages.</p><p>New Mexico law requires a minimum amount of car insurance that must be carried by every driver.  This amount of insurance coverage is the following:</p><ul><li>$25,000 per person;</li><li>$50,000 per accident; and</li><li>$10,000 for property damage from an accident (i.e., car damage).</li></ul><p><b>Receiving Compensation Under New Mexico Car Insurance Laws</b></p><p>Therefore, an accident victim may seek compensation in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li>File a claim with the at-fault driver’s insurance company;</li><li>File a claim with the victim’s own insurance company, who will then seek contribution to the at-fault driver’s insurance company for reimbursement; or</li><li>Commence a lawsuit for personal injuries and/or property damage.</li></ul><p>After a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a>, it will likely be overwhelming to determine what to do next.  Particularly because New Mexico is an at-fault state, some victims may not understand what rights they have to get compensation.  Some victims may feel they are at-fault for the accident, or partially at fault.</p><p>No matter what you may believe, always contact a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/when-to-contact-an-attorney-after-a-new-mexico-car-accident/">New Mexico car accident attorney</a> who has both the legal training and experience to make this determination.</p><p><b>Having Trouble with the Insurance Company?  Contact our New Mexico Car Accident Attorneys Today!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a car accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys </a>at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Reasons to Contact an Attorney After a New Mexico Car Accident</b></p><p>After a car accident, many people may feel too embarrassed to contact an attorney.  They may feel that they are not injured enough to speak with a lawyer.  Or they may feel the car accident was partially their fault.  But by not contacting an experienced car accident attorney after a car accident, you may be losing rights that you may have to compensation for your injuries, medical bills, property damage, lost wages, and lost earnings.</p><p>When in doubt, always contact an attorney to discuss your case.  Here at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">compassionate New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> have handled many cases of varying severity and varying fault.  We treat every client with the respect and dignity they deserve because we are here to help protect the rights of those injured in motor vehicle accidents.  We will listen to the facts of your case and advise you of your rights and how to proceed.  If you are unsure whether you have a case, call us today for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>When To Contact and Attorney After a New Mexico Car Accident</b></p><p>Generally, every <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a> in which you sustain personal injuries should be investigated by an attorney.  This includes even minor injuries, such as a broken finger or toe, backache, or scars.  However, there are some guidelines when to contact an attorney such as the following:</p><ul><li><b><i>Types of Injuries</i></b><i> </i>– if you have broken bones, damaged organs, or require surgeries, you should always contact a car accident attorney.  These are some of the more severe injuries that can be sustained in a car accident and will almost always result in compensation.</li></ul><ul><li><b><i>High Medical Bills</i></b> – another good gauge of when to contact an attorney is when you have accumulated high medical bills.  If you find that you are spending a large percentage of your income on medical bills, or if you find you cannot pay for all of the medical bills as they occur, you should contact an attorney to determine whether someone else is legally responsible for your bills.</li></ul><ul><li><b><i>Recovery time</i> </b>– the longer the time it takes you to recover from your injuries, the more likely you should consult with a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/"><i>car accident attorney</i></a>.  This is because the longer period of time to recovery means you likely have a more severe injury than you may believe and you may be accumulating high medical bills.</li></ul><ul><li><b><i>Time out of Work</i></b> – if you have been unable to go to work for an extended period of time due to your injuries from a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><i>car accident</i></a>, you should consult with an attorney to determine whether you can receive compensation for your lost wages.</li></ul><p><b>If You Have ANY of the Factors Noted Above, Contact a New Mexico Car Accident Attorney Today!</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a car accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys </a>at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Speeding Tractor Trailer Truck Driver Caused New Mexico Trucking Accident</b></p><p>Commercial trucks, tractor trailers, and semi trucks are very large and heavy vehicles.  These big vehicles travel throughout the United States, particularly on highways and interstates in New Mexico.  Part of a trucking company and truck driver’s job is to transport cargo as fast as they possibly can to their destination.  Time is money.  The faster the trucking companies can make the trips, the faster the trucking company can reload the cargo and start another paying job.  Thus, the faster they go the more money they make.</p><p>This monetary incentive leads to cutting corners.  One of the easiest corners for a trucking company and trucking driver to cut is driving within the speed limit.  This is particularly true on the interstates and highways, where truck drivers may feel immune to speed restrictions due to the difficulty in enforcing the vast stretches of roadway.  The faster the tractor trailer or commercial truck goes, the longer it takes the truck to stop, the shorter the reaction time the driver has to avoid an accident, and the greater the momentum the truck has which could cause significant damage to whatever it hits.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been involved in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident</a> because a truck driver was speeding above the speed limits and restrictions, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys </a>at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. by calling (505) 883-5000 for a FREE consultation.  We have the experience and knowledge necessary to properly investigate your claim and discover how fast the truck driver was driving at the time of your accident.  Contact us today to learn how we can protect your rights to compensation due to a speeding truck driver.</p><p><b>Speeding Tractor Trailer Causing New Mexico Trucking Accident is Liable for Your Injuries</b></p><p>Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-301/">New Mexico law, NM Stat. 66-7-301</a> provides under subdivision (d) the following:</p><p>“In every event, speed shall be so controlled by the driver as may be necessary: (1) to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle or other conveyance on or entering the highway; (2) to comply with legal requirements as may be established by the state highway and transportation department or the New Mexico state police division of department of public safety and the duty of all persons to use due car . . . .”</p><p>Where a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">commercial truck, tractor trailer, semi, flatbed, or other large truck causes a motor vehicle accident</a> because the truck driver was speeding above the speed limit, the driver and the trucking company may be liable for all injuries related to the accident under this section of law.</p><p>This law is meant to protect other individuals on or around the roadway from motor vehicle accidents.  When a truck driver ignores the importance of this section of law, he or she may be negligent per se.  This is an automatic finding of negligence where the statutory violation is the cause of the damages.</p><p><b>Speed Kills: New Mexico Trucking Accidents are Deadly</b></p><p>It goes without saying that <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">all trucking accidents are very dangerous</a> and can cause serious, permanent, and debilitating injuries to victims.  Unfortunately, most trucking accidents involve the death of the victim—while the truck driver walks away without injury.</p><p>When a truck driver is speeding above the speed limit in his big rig, he is increasing the amount of damage he is going to cause to a victim of a truck accident.  He is also increasing the difficulty he will have maneuvering the truck, his stopping distance, and his momentum.  But he is decreasing his reaction time.  All very bad things.  This is why speeding in a commercial truck, semi truck, tractor trailer, or other large truck is very dangerous and simply deadly.</p><p><b>If a Speeding Truck Driver Caused your New Mexico Trucking Accident, Call Us today!!!</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced speeding tractor trailer truck accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Who is Liable When One Driver Has Sun in His Eyes and Causes a New Mexico Car Accident?</b></p><p>While nighttime driving is certainly more dangerous than driving during the day, in New Mexico the bright sun can certainly become a contributing factor to a motor vehicle accident.  Indeed, sun glare and bright sun can affect a motorist’s vision while driving.  This is particularly true when looking directly into the sunshine while driving, when when the strong sunshine creates confusing shadows.  This can make driving more dangerous and lead to deadly results.</p><p>If you or a loved one were injured in a New Mexico car accident caused by a driver who claims the sun was in his or her eyes, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. by calling (505) 883-5000 for a FREE case evaluation.  We know how to investigate your claim and ensure that you receive the compensation you are entitled to for the other driver’s negligence.  Call us today to learn how we can protect your rights, pay for your medical bills, lost wages, and your pain and suffering.</p><p><b>Sunshine is Not a Defense in New Mexico Car Accidents</b></p><p>While it may sound like a good defense to a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a>, and it can be a common occurrence, it is not a valid excuse.  Motorists owe others on or near the roadway a duty of care.  Part of this duty of care is to exercise a reasonable degree of caution.  This includes seeing what there is to be seen when driving.</p><p>If a motorist cannot see where he or she is going because there is sun in his or her eyes, a motorist cannot blindly plow forward on the roadway.  The motorist needs to abate the condition, such as using sun protection like sunglasses or the visor.  Or the motorist needs to stop driving forward until the condition passes.  This may be difficult or inadvisable to do, thus the motorist should proceed with caution as only to what he or she can see.</p><p>Therefore, a motorist who cannot see, the sun is in his or her eyes, or there is sun glare on the windshield, may be liable for causing a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a>.  This includes any damages caused by the car accident, including personal injuries, pain and suffering, and property damage.</p><p><b>Contact our Experienced New Mexico Car Accident Attorneys if the Defendant Claims Sun or Sun Glare as a Defense to Your Car Accident</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a New Mexico car accident caused by bright sun or sun glare, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys </a>at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Injuries Caused by New Mexico Trucking Accidents Caused By Unsecured or Loose Cargo</b></p><p>Throughout the United States, particularly New Mexico, it is clear that commercial trucking is a huge and important business for Americans.  One can barely drive on any roadway without seeing a large commercial truck.  This is especially true on interstates and highways, where the shear number of trucks can make it feel like they outnumber cars.  The reason is that these tractor trailer trucks carry important cargo we use everyday.  This cargo can be very large and significant, including construction materials, lumber, or pallets of goods.</p><p>But sometimes these cargos are not properly secured and can cause very serious trucking accidents.  If you or a loved one has been injured in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accident </a>caused by an unsecured cargo or load, contact the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. by calling (505) 883-5000.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Our experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> know how to investigate and represent victims of trucking accidents.  We have the knowledge and experience necessary to ensure you get the maximum amount of compensation you are entitled to.</p><p><b>Unsecured Cargo Causing New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Trucking companies and truck drivers are responsible for securing their cargo on their tractor trailer prior to entering the public roadway.  Trucking companies and truck drivers are also responsible for knowing the weight of the cargo they are carrying, the weight limitations of their vehicle, and how the weight of their cargo will effect how the tractor trailer needs to be driven.</p><p>This is because the cargo weight determines the types of roads that can be used, the type of safety equipment required, the maximum speeds permitted, and the warning and identification signs required.  Any miscue in these calculations can cause a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">serious trucking accident</a>.</p><p><b>Types of Unsecured Cargo Truck Accidents</b></p><p>When a trucking company or truck driver fails to manage the cargo loads on the tractor trailer, this can lead to very serious motor vehicle accidents.  Some common types of trucking accident caused by unsecured or improperly loaded trucks include the following:</p><ul><li>Cargo that is not secured or improperly secured coming off the truck;</li><li>Cargo falling and crushing other vehicles;</li><li>Cargo shifting and causing the tractor trailer to jackknife;</li><li>Causing the tractor trailer to be too heavy and making it difficult to stop;</li><li>Too heavy cargo ripping or popping straps causing it to come off the truck;</li><li>Heavy cargo causing tires to blowout, explode, or fail;</li><li>Cargo shifting and causing the tractor trailer to rollover;</li><li>Heavy cargo making steering or maneuvering the tractor trailer too difficult; and</li><li>Other incidents where the cargo or load on the tractor trailer causes the accident.</li></ul><p><b>Unsecured Trucking Cargo Can Cause Serious Personal Injuries in a New Mexico Trucking Accident</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced unsecured trucking cargo attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Car Accidents Caused by Excessive Speed Can Result in Serious Personal Injuries </b></p><p>Speed kills.  It is well known that motorists who drive too fast are more likely to be involved in a motor vehicle accident.  Speed reduces a motorist’s reaction time but increased the amount of time a motor vehicle takes to brake.  This is a deadly combination and a recipe for serious personal injuries due to devastating car accidents.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a> caused by a speeding motorist, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. by calling (505) 883-5000.  Our attorneys know how dangerous excessive speed, and we have handled many motor vehicle accidents caused by a speeding defendant.  A victim of a car accident caused by a speeding driver may be entitled to compensation for his or her injuries.</p><p><b>Liability in Speeding New Mexico Car Accidents </b></p><p>There are two theories of liability which would render a defendant who caused a car accident because he or she was speeding liable.  The first is under a theory of common law negligence.  This is judge made law, meaning it has evolved over the decades of jurisprudence.  Negligence is where a defendant owes a duty of care to another, breaches that duty, and such breach causes damage to another.  When a motorist speeds and causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a>, he or she has breached his or her duty of care and may be liable for any injuries caused by the car accident.</p><p>In addition to imposing liability under common law, or judge made law, a defendant who causes a car accident due to speeding may also be negligence per se.  The doctrine of negligence per se finds a defendant negligent as a matter of law, that is automatically, if he or she violates a statute can causes a car accident.  The statute must be designed to prevent against a certain harm and protect a class of persons.</p><p>Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-301/">New Mexico law, NM Stat. 66-7-301</a> is the statute that prevents against car accidents caused by excessive speed and protects other motorists.  This <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-301/">section of law</a> provides under subdivision (d) the following:</p><p>“In every event, speed shall be so controlled by the driver as may be necessary: (1) to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle or other conveyance on or entering the highway; (2) to comply with legal requirements as may be established by the state highway and transportation department or the New Mexico state police division of department of public safety and the duty of all persons to use due car . . . .”</p><p>Therefore, if a defendant collides with another vehicle due to his or her speed, he may be negligent under the common law and under the doctrine of negligence per se under the first subsection.  This includes if the defendant is driving <i>under </i>the speed limit.  Additionally, if a defendant is speeding above the speed limits, he or she may also be liable under the common law and doctrine of negligent per se under the second subsection.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced New Mexico Car Accident Attorney If You Have Been Injured in a Car Accident Caused by a Speeding Defendant</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a New Mexico car accident caused by excessive speed, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys </a>at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>New Mexico Drunk Driver Car Accidents on July Fourth</b></p><p>It goes without saying that July Fourth is commonly celebrated with BBQs, family events, and fireworks, all to celebrate America’s Independence.  Many of these celebratory events involve alcohol.  When the get together is over, many people who have consumed alcohol will get behind the wheel of a motor vehicle to travel home.  While many of these people will have acted responsibility in either having a designated driver or ensuring they are sober before they drive, unfortunately many others will not.</p><p>This is why July Fourth is one of the most dangerous days on the road due to drunk drivers.  Many intoxicated drivers will make preventable errors such as running stop signs, not yielding, or speeding which cause serious <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accidents</a>.  These car accidents can result in debilitating and permanent personal injuries, including paralysis, disability, and death.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been serious injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident </a>caused by a drunk driver, <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">contact the Caruso Law Offices, P.C</a>. for a FREE consultation by calling (505) 883-5000.  We understand the frustration that a victim and his or her family will feel after a drunk driver causes a car accident.  We have the experience and knowledge necessary to help the victim of a drunk driver car accident obtain the compensation he or she deserves.  Contact us today to learn how to protect your rights.</p><p><b>Liability in New Mexico Drunk Driver Car Accidents</b></p><p>Generally, when a drunk driver causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a>, the drunk driver will be responsible for the car accident and any damages therein.  For a victim to be entitled to compensation, the drunk driver must be have been a <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cause</span></em></strong> of the motor vehicle accident.  Meaning, the drunk driver must have somehow contributed to the happening of the car accident.  If the drunk driver contributed to the cause of the car accident, the drunk driver will be liable.</p><p>If the drunk driver is not responsible, for instance, if the drunk driver is just sitting at a red light and a vehicle crashed into the drunk driver, the drunk driver will not be liable for the car accident caused by another driver.  Thus, there must be something that the drunk driver did that caused the car accident.</p><p>However, if the drunk driver is the one that caused the car accident, liability will usually attach.  This is particularly important because juries usually will condemn a drunk driver at trial and often handsomely reward a victim of a drunk driving accident.</p><p><b>Common Types of New Mexico Drunk Driver Accidents</b></p><p>There are many causes of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico drunk driver car accidents</a> in which the drunk driver will be liable for the accident.  Some common types of car accidents include the following:</p><ul><li>Running a red light;</li><li>Failing to yield;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/new-mexico-rear-end-truck-accidents-causing-serious-personal-injuries/">Rear-end car accidents</a>;</li><li>Running a stop sign;</li><li>Side-swipe car accidents;</li><li>Crossing the center line;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/negligent-overtaking-and-passing-causing-an-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accident/">Improper overtaking or passing</a>;</li><li>Unsafe lane changes;</li><li>Unsafe speed or excessive speed;</li><li>Failing to safely merge;</li><li>Jumping the curb;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/left-hand-turn-car-accidents-at-intersections-albuquerque-car-accident-attorney-discusses-liability/">Improper left-turn car accidents</a>;</li><li></li><li>Head-on collisions;</li><li>T-bone car accidents; and</li><li>Many other types of car accidents.</li></ul><p><b>Contact an Experienced New Mexico Drunk Driver Car Accident Attorney for your July Fourth Car Accidents</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a New Mexico drunk driver car accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys </a>at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Car Accident Attorneys</a> Discuss Common Causes of Car Accidents During July Fourth Weekend</b></p><p>While marking our Independence, the July Fourth holiday is also one of the largest travel, BBQ, drinking, and celebratory holidays on the calendar.  Many Americans will travel far distances to celebrate the holiday, and it is predicted that this year will be one of the highest traveled July Fourths in a few years.  Because of the increased travel on the road, it is only natural for there to be an increased number of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accidents</a>.  This is particularly true due to the increased number of people partaking in drinking alcoholic drinks to celebrate the holiday.  This combination of increased traffic and increased alcohol use is a recipe for serious car accidents.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in a car accident caused on July Fourth weekend, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys</a> for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  We have handled many<a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/"> Motor Vehicle Accident</a> causes, including those occurring on holidays and due to alcohol.  We will fight hard to protect your rights to compensation and uncover the causes of your motor vehicle accident.</p><p><b>Common Causes of July Fourth Weekend Car Accidents</b></p><p>Increased traffic on the roadway alone is not a reason to cause <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accidents</a>.  Whether there are no cars or hundreds of cars, motorists must exercise caution in operating their motor vehicle.  Said differently, increased traffic is not negligence which could entitle a victim to compensation.</p><p>However, there are other contributing factors which may cause motor vehicle accidents on July Fourth weekend, and which may be caused by the negligence of the other driver causing the accident.  Some common examples include the following:</p><ul><li><i>Alcohol and drug related impairments</i> – As noted above, July Fourth weekend is marked with BBQs and alcohol.  Many people celebrating this holiday will have an alcoholic drink at a BBQ or party.  They may then try to drive home.  Even after just one alcoholic drink, a motorist’s ability to react may be impaired.  Driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs—illegal or prescribed—can cause a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a> and be negligent.</li></ul><ul><li><i>Distracted driving</i> – Many people traveling for July Fourth weekend may have several other people in the motor vehicle with them.  This could be other family members or friends.  With an increased number of passengers comes an increased number of distractions for the driver.  When a passenger distracts the driver of a motor vehicle, this can cause a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><i>car accident</i></a> and be due to negligence.  Other distractions such as using the GPS to find the party location or BBQ, using a cell phone to call for directions, or texting friends to let them know where you are can also result in serious car accidents and be caused by the negligent conduct of the driver.</li></ul><ul><li><i>Mechanical problems or Defects with a Motor Vehicle</i> – Not everyone travels far distances often.  Some people just drive on local roads.  But for July Fourth, they may be required to drive far distances for the first time in awhile.  Their motor vehicle may not be fine-tuned or have defects that may not be noticeable on local roads, but while driving high speeds on interstates and highways it could be a serious defect.  Some examples include faulty steering wheels, worn down brakes, or balding tires.  A motorist is liable for the condition of his or her car, so if a mechanical defect caused the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><i>motor vehicle accident</i></a>, the motorist would be liable for the car accident due to negligence.</li></ul><p><b>Contact an Experienced <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico Car Accident Attorney</a> for your July Fourth Car Accidents</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in an Albuquerque car accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico car accident attorneys </a>at the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact us</a> on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Seatbelt Injuries Caused by Albuquerque Car Accidents Can Result in Very Serious Pain and Suffering</b></p><p>Seatbelts are the most common and most important safety device in a motor vehicle.  They have dramatically reduced the number of serious injuries and deaths caused from motor vehicle accidents.  However, sometimes seatbelts can be the cause of some injuries that would not have normally happened but for the seatbelt.  Meaning, the seatbelt was the cause of the injury.</p><p>A victim of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a> may be entitled to get compensation for seatbelt injuries.  If you or a loved one have been injured in a car accident and sustained injuries due to the seatbelt, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caurso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced car accidents attorneys</a> have handled many types of seatbelt injuries caused by car accidents and fought for the compensation the victims desired.</p><p><b>How Seatbelts Can Cause Injuries in Albuquerque Car Accidents</b></p><p>While seatbelts do a tremendous amount of good, they can be the sole creator of an injury.  In a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">car accident</a>, a motor vehicle comes to a sudden, violent stop.  This requires the seatbelt to restrain the still-moving occupants of the vehicle, as the occupants vehicle are still moving forward even though the motor vehicle is not.  This creates pressure on several points of the body, including the shoulder, collar bone, hips, and abdomen.</p><p>When worn correctly, automobile companies have constructed seatbelts to take these pressure points into account and reduce the friction and force on the body.  However, when the collision is simply too violent, the seatbelt is defective, or the seatbelt is improperly worn, an occupant can still receive significant injuries at these locations.</p><p><b>Types of Seatbelt Injuries Caused in Albuquerque Car Accidents</b></p><p>Generally, seatbelt injuries are minor and merely involve uncomfortable pressure.  Sometimes there can be bruising or even scrapes from the restraints.  The more severe the collision and the deceleration of the body, the more significant the seatbelt injuries.</p><p>In very severe and catastrophic motor vehicle accidents, <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">like tractor trailer accidents</a>, the seatbelt will likely cause more significant injuries.  While this sounds like a bad thing, the seatbelt is preventing you from more devastating and possibly fatal injuries which are more likely without the seatbelt.  Some common times of seatbelt injuries include the following:</p><ul><li>Lacerations on the chest and abdomen;</li><li>Organ bruising or organ ruptures, or other similar injuries;</li><li>Broken collarbones;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/understanding-spinal-cord-injuries-caused-by-a-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accident/">Spinal cord injuries</a>;</li><li>Whiplash injuries;</li><li>Shoulder dislocations;</li><li>Brachial plexus injuries;</li><li>Nerve injuries;</li><li>Broken ribs;</li><li>Hip strains;</li><li>Groin strains;</li><li>and other serious injuries.</li></ul><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque Car Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in an Albuquerque car accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Car Accident Attorney Explains T-Bone Car Accidents</b></p><p>There are large crunch zones in the front and rear of most motor vehicles.  However, there is very little if any crunch space on the sides of a motor vehicle.  Thus, any type of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">side impact or t-bone car accident</a> is very dangerous for this reason.  Even low speed side impacts or t-bone crashes can result in significant injury to the occupants of a motor vehicle.  Generally where there is a side impact or t-bone collision, one party is negligent for causing the accident.</p><p>If you or a loved one were injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">side impact or t-bone car accident</a>, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. </a>for a FREE case evaluation by calling (505) 883-5000.  We will fight to protect your rights to compensation for your injuries caused by the negligence of another motorist.</p><p><b>Liability in Side Impact and T-Bone <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Car Accidents</a></b></p><p>Generally, one of the motorists is going to be largely at fault for a side impact or t-bone car accident.  This type of accident is simply not the product of slight carelessness or mistake.  Rather, this is the type of accident where one motorist was not paying attention, violates a vehicle and traffic law, or is grossly negligent in the operation of his or her vehicle.  Common causes of side impact and t-bone car accidents are the following:</p><ul><li>Running a red light;</li><li>Failure to yield;</li><li>Distracted driver (cell phone, GPS, radio);</li><li>Drunk driving;</li><li>Running a stop sign;</li><li>Improper left turn;</li><li>Unsafe U-turn; and</li><li>Similar incidents.</li></ul><p><b>Damages in Side Impact and T-Bone Car Accidents</b></p><p>Due to the fact that the sides of most motor vehicles are thin and without a crunch zone, side impact and t-bone car accidents can easily cause very serious and devastating injuries or death to occupants of motor vehicles.  Because of the unique force of impact, i.e., coming from the side, most motor vehicles do not adequately provide protections.  For instance, seats and head rests are designed mostly for front and rear collisions, whereas some motor vehicle only have side impact curtains on one side of the passenger—not usually both sides.</p><p>For these reasons, side impact and t-bone car accidents can result in very serious injuries.  Some of these injuries include the following:</p><ul><li>Broken arms;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries</a>;</li><li>Broken legs;</li><li>Fractured ribs;</li><li>Large lacerations;</li><li>Paraplegia;</li><li>Nerve injuries;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/understanding-spinal-cord-injuries-caused-by-a-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accident/">Spinal Cord Injuries</a>;</li><li>Amputation of limbs;</li><li>Back injuries;</li><li>Death; and</li><li>Many other very serious injuries.</li></ul><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque T-Bone <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Car Accident Attorney</a></b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in an Albuquerque car accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys</a> at the <strong><a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a></strong> today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact us</a> on our <a href="/">website</a> through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Using the FMCSA to your Advantage in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>While the law may be similar, each state has a different body of law and legal nuances.  This makes trucking litigation more difficult as a trucking company from Delaware, picking up cargo in New Jersey, transporting the cargo to California, and driving through New Mexico will encounter many different laws, regulations, and legal requirements.  The can quickly become burdensome, and safety requirements in New Jersey may be different than New Mexico.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/mission">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)</a> was created within the U.S. Department of Transportation in 2000.  The FMCSA’s primary mission is to “reduce crashes, injuries and fatalities involving large trucks and buses.”  To this effect, the FMCSA conducts studies and promulgates regulations which apply throughout the United States—whether or not a state has adopted similar safety protections.  This unifies the safety requirements and obligations on trucking companies and tractor trailers traveling throughout many states.</p><p>Here at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C., our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> know how to use the FMCSA as a sword against negligent trucking companies and truck drivers causing serious personal injuries on our roadways.  If you or a loved one has been <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">seriously injured or killed in a trucking accident</a>, contact us today for a FREE case evaluation by calling (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Regulations Under the FMCSA</b></p><p>The FMCSA issues and publishes regulations application to trucking companies and truck drivers.  The FMCSA regulates many different aspects of commercial trucking, including types of vehicles, qualifications and training for truck drivers, insurance requirements, hours of operation a truck driver may operate a vehicle, and many other aspects of intercontinental trucking.</p><p>The regulations issued by the FMCSA are complied in the <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/ECFR?page=browse">U.S. Code of Federal Regulations</a>.  These regulations apply to almost all trucking companies, truck drivers, and tractor trailer or large commercial trucks in the United States.</p><p><b>Violations of FMCSA Regulations</b></p><p>Under New Mexico law, a violation of a regulation is evidence of negligence.  This includes a violation of a regulation issued by the FMCSA and contained in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations.  Even though a violation of a regulation is not automatically a finding of negligence, a violation of a FMCSA regulation provides a strong basis for negligence.</p><p>Thus, a violation of a FMCSA regulation will <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">help establish negligence on the part of a trucking company and truck driver in a personal injury case</a>.  Many times the regulations prescribe specific requirements that a trucking company and truck driver must comply with.  If the trucking company and truck driver fail to comply with these requirements, and such failure causes personal injuries, a jury is likely to hold the trucking company and truck driver liable.  This is why having a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">knowledgable New Mexico trucking accident attorney</a> is very important to find the applicable regulations and establish a violation of them.</p><p><b>Contact the FMSCA Knowledgable Attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.

<p><b>New Mexico Trucking Accident Attorneys Explain Why Trucking Accidents on Interstates are So Deadly</b></p><p>All <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking accidents are dangerous</a> and can easily be deadly.  Even if they are just bumper taps or at low speeds, commercial trucks and semis can cause serious personal injuries.  Some of the most dangerous types of trucking accidents occur on the interstates and highways around New Mexico.  This is because of the sheer weight and speed of these large commercial vehicles traveling on these roadways.  This generate significant momentum.  When a tractor trailer, semi, or commercial truck collides with any other object, such as a passenger vehicle, this momentum is transferred and disbursed through that object.  This creates catastrophic damage.</p><p>Approximately two years ago, this occurred on Interstate 10 when three tractor trailers and commercial trucks rear-ended three passenger vehicles.  This resulted in a pileup accident and caused a fire.  The occupants of the passenger vehicles were all killed in the fire, while the truck drivers walked away without serious injury.</p><p>The Caruso Law Offices, P.C. represents the estate of Joseph Guttuso, one of the deceased passenger vehicle occupants, in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accident </a>and <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death </a>case.  If you or a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a New Mexico trucking accident, contact the <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">experienced interstate trucking accident attorneys</a> at the Caurso Law Offices, P.C. for a FREE consultation by calling (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Speed Kills on Interstates and Highways: Reasons Why Fast Speed Creates Additional Danger</b></p><p>Interstates and highways are some of the most dangerous types of roads a motorist can travel on.  This is because these roadways have high speed limits.  The faster a vehicle goes, the more momentum and force it will have.  Speed also reduces reaction time but increases stopping time.  This is a deadly combination.</p><p>Tractor trailers, semis, and large commercial vehicles are particularly dangerous on interstates and highways for this reason.  The truck driver’s reaction time is reduced just like any other motorist.  However, the truck driver’s stopping time is significantly increased much more than any other vehicle.  This is because tractor trailers, semis, and large commercial trucks weigh more than other vehicles.  This makes stopping a large truck more difficult and it takes more time than other vehicles.</p><p><b>Trucks are Inherently Deadly on Interstates and Highways</b></p><p>Therefore, tractor trailers, semis, and large commercial trucks traveling on interstates and highways all possess the dangerous elements for causing serious motor vehicle accidents.  They are big and heavy, effectively battering rams.  They are moving fast on the interstate and highway, reducing reaction time and increasing stopping time.  And they are more difficult to maneuver and stop to avoid hazards on the roadways, including families in passenger vehicles.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Interstate trucking accidents are dangerous and deadly</a>.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced New Mexico Interstate Trucking Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced personal injury attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Learning the Smith System of Defensive Driving Can Prevent Albuquerque Trucking Accidents and Save Your Life!</b></p><p>It is often said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  And when it comes to avoiding <a href="http://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accidents</a>, particularly <a href="http://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accidents</a>, that statement could not be more applicable.  Preventing a motor vehicle accident in the first place is the best way to keep you and your loved ones safe.  When it comes to trucking accidents, you may not get a second chance due to the sheer size and power these types of vehicles have.</p><p>Here at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C., we understand the importance of preventing motor vehicle accidents and <a href="http://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accidents</a> because we have seen the devastating and debilitating damage these types of accidents can cause.  But if you or a loved one were unfortunate enough to be in one, our <a href="http://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys</a> have the knowledge and compassion necessary to ensure your rights are protected.  Contact us today for a FREE case evaluation by calling (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>The Smith System of Defense Driving</b></p><p>There are five points of the Smith System of Defense Driving which you should commit to memory and practice whenever operating a motor vehicle.  This is particularly important to avoid <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">tractor trailer, semi, and other large commercial vehicle accidents</a>.  The five points of the Smith System of Defensive Driving include the following:</p><p>1 – <i>Aim High When Driving</i> – The first rule is to “aim high in steering.”  Meaning staying alert of the traffic dangers not just right in front of you, but further down the road and even in front of the cars in front of you.  This helps the driver view the road as a whole and not just what is immediately in front of the moving vehicle.</p><p>2 – <i>The Big Picture</i> – Look for all hazards in and around the roadway.  This includes looking in front of you, behind you, in the lanes to your side, bicyclists along the roadway, pedestrians crossing, or car doors opening.  Survey the whole roadway and what could come into it as a hazard.</p><p>3 – <i>Keep Your Eyes Moving </i>– Keep your eyes constantly moving and looking at hazards and obstacles as you continue to drive forward.  Do not stare, and do not focus just in one direction for a long period of time.  You should be constantly scanning and moving your eyes around.</p><p>4 – <i>Leave Yourself and Out</i> – Whenever you are driving a motor vehicle, ensure that you have one space to turn to in the case of an emergency.  This means leaving yourself a little bubble to escape to in the result of an emergency.  Never block yourself or box yourself in so you have no where to do if something comes in front of you.  Always have a safe space to turn into as an “out.”</p><p>5 – <i>Make Sure Others Can See You</i> – This is the most important part of driving defensively when on the roadway with trucks, semis, and other large commercial vehicles.  Always make sure that other motorists and truck drivers can see you and know where you are.  Always make sure you are seen and visible.  If you are not sure you are or were seen, use your horn or lights (if at night) to get another motorist’s attention.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque Trucking Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="http://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced personal injury attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="http://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Victims of New Mexico Trucking Accidents are Entitled to Compensatory Damages</b></p><p><a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> can cause serious personal injuries and death.  Approximately two years ago, seven people were killed in a New Mexico trucking accident on Intestate 10 during an oncoming dust storm.  These seven people were traveling in three passenger vehicles on Interstate 10.  Due to the ongoing dust storm, they slowed down as reasonable under the circumstances.  However, three tractor trailer and commercial trucks did not slow down and rear ended the three passenger vehicles causing a pileup accident.  There was an explosion which started a fire, killing all seven occupants of the passenger vehicles.  No truck drivers were killed or injured.</p><p>One of the deceased is Joseph Guttuso.  His estate contacted the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. to represent Mr. Guttuso in the trucking accident and <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death claim</a>.  The matter is currently in a jury trial in Santa Fe county.  The family is seeking compensation for the wrongful loss of Mr. Guttuso as a result of the negligence of the trucking companies and truck drivers.  If you, a loved one, or someone you know has been seriously injured or killed in a New Mexico trucking accident, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE case evaluation by dialing (505) 883-5000 to learn about your rights to compensation.</p><p><b>Types of Damages in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>There are several different types of damages which a victim of a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a> could be entitled to.  Whether an individual is entitled to such damages depends on the facts of the case and whether such damages are related to the accident.  Some examples of damages include the following:</p><ul><li>Past pain and suffering from injuries during the accident and up to trial;</li><li>Future pain and suffering from remaining injuries after trial;</li><li>Emotional pain and suffering;</li><li>Lost wages due to injuries;</li><li>Lost earning capacity due to injuries, which prevent a victim from returning to the same job;</li><li>Medical expenses and bills, including medical liens;</li><li>Medical supplies and treatment;</li><li>Property damage, including damage to vehicles;</li><li>Future surgeries or medical treatment;</li><li>Loss of consortium and services of a spouse;</li><li>Wrongful death and</li><li>Many several other types of damages.</li></ul><p><b>Calculating Damages in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>The calculation of damages is not as formulaic as people hope.  Meaning, there is no exact method to calculate most types of damages—with the exception sometimes for lost wages and lost earning capacity.  This can be frustrating to injured victims because they may not be able to determine what they are entitled to.  However, our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> know how to calculate damage and estimate damages based one our years of experience.</p><p>For pain and suffering damages, the amount an individual is entitled to is based on the reasonable compensation that other victims with similar injuries in similar circumstances have received.  This can be through other settlements, jury verdicts, of appellate-level court decisions requiring whether the compensation a victim received was reasonable. Therefore, each injury as a “going rate” which it will typically settle for.  There are, of course, other factors to consider such as the victim’s age, severity of the injuries, and comparative fault in causing the accident—all which can affect the amount of damages.</p><p>As for medical expenses, bills, and treatment costs, these types of damages can be calculated by simply adding up the total amount.  But the victim also needs to establish that these expenses are related to the subject accident and reasonable.  Because of this, this calculation may require a little more than just doing basic math.</p><p>As for lost wages and earning capacity, typically an economist is needed to calculate the average growth of the victim’s job, salary increases, and projects to a reasonable degree of accounting certainty.  This can be very complicated to do, even for an attorney, and specialized knowledge from a retained expert is usually needed.</p><p><b>Obtaining Damages in a New Mexico Trucking Accident</b></p><p>If a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the experienced personal injury attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>What Compensation is a Burn Victim Entitled to in a New Mexico Trucking Accident?</b></p><p>Burn injuries are some of the most horrific and painful injuries that any individual can sustain.  Many times burn injuries will cause scarring, and can result in serious and permanent tissue, nerve, muscle, or tendon and ligament damage.  Burn injuries can also cause a very agonizing wrongful death, particularly in <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">trucking accident cases</a>.</p><p>The Caruso Law Offices, P.C. is currently in trial for a burn injury case resulting in such the death of Joseph Guttuso.  This accident occurred approximately two years ago as a result of a New Mexico trucking accident on Interstate 10.  Three passenger vehicles were traveling through an ongoing dust storm and appropriately slowed down given the ongoing weather conditions.  However, three truck drivers continued to plow through the ongoing dust storm blindly.  This resulted in a large pileup collision and an explosion, trapping Mr. Guttuso and six others.  These seven victims burned to death, while the truck drivers walked away without serious injury.</p><p>If you or a loved on has

883-5000.</p><p><b>Types of Burn Injuries in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accidents</a> can result in many different types of injuries, most being very significant and catastrophic.  Burn injuries can be a very common type of trucking accident injury.  There are three classifications of burns.  These include the following:</p><p><i>First Degree Burns</i> – This is the least serious burn injury, but it can still be very painful.  This affects the outer layer of skin.  This is usually characterized by swelling, redness of the skin, and pain.  Most of the time a first degree burn alone will not require immediately medical attention, but it may be necessary if the redness and swelling does not go away in a few days, the pain worsens, or an infection starts.</p><p><i>Second Degree Burns </i>– This type of burn injury occurs when the second layer of skin is burned, not just the first lawyer.  A second degree burn is usually identified by blistering, and is a deep, red color.  These types of burns are very painful and will remain painful for days.  There will be swelling.  The skin may even crack a little at the blister, causing an oozing or bleeding.  While all second degree burns should be treated by a medical professional, small second degree burns (less than three inches long) could be treated at home without issue.</p><p><i>Third Degree Burns</i> – This is the most serious type of burn and always requires immediately medical attention, no matter how small.  This occurs when all layers of the skin are burned, and the damage affects the underlying tissue.  These types of burns appear black or charred-looking, and may result in bleeding.  They are incredibly painful and will remain painful for a long time.</p><p><b>Value of a Burn Injury Case Caused by a New Mexico Trucking Accident</b></p><p>Like all injuries, burn injuries cause pain and suffering.  It is this pain and suffering that you can get compensated for, in addition to damages for surgery, scarring, lost wages, lost earning, and past or future medical expenses.  The more severe the burn, the more pain and suffering, and thus the more compensation you may be entitled to.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><i>New Mexico trucking accidents</i></a> can result in very serious burn injuries, particularly when there are explosions.</p><p>The value of a victim’s case will depend on the severity of the burn (first degree versus third degree), and the extent that the burn covers the body.  The worse the burn and the more coverage, the more pain and suffering and thus the more compensation.</p><p>Burn injuries can also result in a lot of surgeries, like grafting.  These surgeries are incredibly painful and may have to be repeated multiple times.  Burn injuries can also easily result in infections, which are extremely painful and life threatening.  The more complications and the more surgeries caused by the accident, the more a burn injury case is worth.</p><p><b>Call the Experienced New Mexico Burn Injury

<p><b>Dust Storm Liability in </b><a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com"><b>New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></a><b>: Guttuso Wrongful Death Trial Underway </b></p><p>Joseph Guttuso and six others were killed on Interstate 10 when three tractor trailer trucks from SAIA Trucking, Towne Freight, and Lights on Trucking rear ended three passenger vehicles causing an explosion and massive fire.  There was an ongoing dust storm on this stretch of Interstate 10, and the three passenger vehicles slowed down as reasonable under the circumstances.  In fact, there was signage along the roadway warning all motorists to do so.</p><p>However, for the three tractor trailer trucks time is money and slowing down was not financially feasible.  The continued to plow ahead despite limited visibility and dangerous continued.  They quickly caught up to the three passenger vehicles and changed the lives of many families in an instant.  But not their families, as none of the truck drivers were killed or seriously injured.  On the other motorists were burned to death in an agonizing way.</p><p>The estate of Joseph Guttuso contacted the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> to represent them to fight for their loved one.  The matter is currently in trial in a Santa Fe courthouse.</p><p>Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> have been compassionately and zealously representing the Guttuso family regarding the wrongful death of their loved one, and look forward to justice being served for the conduct of these three trucking companies.  If you or someone you love has also been killed in a trucking accident, contact the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Visibility is Crucial to Driving a Motor Vehicle: Failure to See and Observe can Create Liability</b></p><p>All motorists must drive in a safe manner.  One of the most important aspects of driving is to see what there is to be seen while operating a motor vehicle.  Visibility is, after all, the most important sense while operating a motor vehicle; if you cannot see, you cannot operating a motor vehicle.  Sight of where you are going and what is around you is simply paramount to safe driving.  While touch and coordination is obviously important to maneuver your vehicle, if you cannot see you do not know where to move to.</p><p>Even just pure nighttime is more dangerous than daytime because a motorist’s visibility is limited in what he or she can see.  This is why natural phenomena like heavy rain, snow, fog, sleet, and dust can pose significant problems for motorists—all of these factors limit visibility on the roadway.</p><p><b>Liability in a Dust Storm: Why Trucks and Commercial Vehicles Must be Careful</b></p><p>Since visibility is the most important component of safely operating a motor vehicle, when visibility is limited, a motorist’s ability to safely drive is also limited.  Meaning, when visibility is limited a motorist cannot drive as if the conditions are perfect and visibility is perfect.  He or she must take limited visibility into consideration.</p><p>Thus, when there is an ongoing dust storm a motorist’s visibility is limited and he or she must exercise the care and caution under these circumstances of a reasonably prudent driver.  He or she must take into consideration the risks of limited visibility and adapt his or her driving to compensate for the limited visibility.</p><p>What does this generally mean?</p><p>SLOW DOWN.</p><p>When a dust storm is limited visibility on the highway or Interstate and you cannot see where you are going, you need to slow down to a rate of speed where you can safely brake or avoid the obstacle within your visual field.  Thus, if your visual field is limited, your speed is limited.</p><p>This is simply a duty of care owed by all motorists to other individuals on or near the roadway.  If this duty is breached and such breach causes damages, that is negligence and the injured victim may seek compensation.</p><p><b>Federal Regulations Condemn Commercial Trucking Companies Failing to Slow Down or Stop Driving in Dust Storms</b></p><p>The <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">negligence of a commercial trucking company </a>and driver is also contained in the federal regulations regarding commercial trucking vehicles.</p><p>This is codified in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, known as the FMCSR.  Under <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/title49/section/392.14">section 392.14</a>, motor vehicles most use extreme caution in hazardous conditions.  More specifically, “[e]xtreme caution in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle shall be exercised when hazardous conditions, such as those caused by . . . dust . . . adversely affect visibility . . . .”  Further, this section requires that “[s]peed shall be reduced when such conditions exist.”  And if such dust is too dangerous, “the operation of the commercial motor vehicle shall be discontinued and shall not be resumed until the commercial motor vehicle can be safely operated.”</p><p>This section makes is unequivocally clear that, where dust limits visibility the commercial trucks must reduce speed, and when such dust becomes too dangerous the commercial trucks must cease driving until it is safe to do so.</p><p>The question for the Santa Fe jury is whether it was too dangerous for these three commercial trucks to continue to drive at the speed they were.  Given the aberrant outcome of seven people burning to death, the answer appears obvious to everyone but the truck drivers and trucking companies.  After all, the truck drivers walked away from this accident.</p><p><b>Contact the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.

<p><b>Interstate Tractor Trailer Truck Accident Highlights Dangers in New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>Tractor trailer trucks, semis, and other large commercial trucks are very dangerous vehicles on the roadway simply because of their sheer size.  This is particularly true on interstates, wherein the speed of these trucks creates significant momentum which takes more distance, time, and force to stop.  If the truck cannot stop on its own or collides with another vehicle, this momentum will be disbursed throughout whatever it hits causing catastrophic damage.  This is why <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accidents are so dangerous</a>.</p><p>On May 22, 2014, almost two years ago exactly, <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/2014/06/02/police-6-killed-in-new-mexico-crash-from-arizona/9882751/">seven people were killed on Interstate 10</a> in a pile up collision with three large trucks.  Three passenger vehicles slowed down and continued through a dust storm exercising due caution.  However, three large semi trucks continued through the dust storm without slowing down as reasonable under the circumstances.  The tractor trailer trucks continued too fast in the dust storm and the rear end and pile up collision occurred, causing a catastrophic fire which killed the seven occupants in the three passenger vehicles; no truck drivers were killed.</p><p><b>Experienced Law Firm Representing Seriously Injured or Killed Victims of New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>The Law Caruso Law Offices, P.C., represents Joseph Guttuso, one of the passengers tragically killed in this trucking accident.  The jury was picked last week, and the trial begins next week on May 31, 2016 in Santa Fe County, New Mexico.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced New Mexico trucking accident attorneys</a> have handled many trucking accident cases involving pile ups, burn injuries, and wrongful death.  If you or a loved one have been injured in a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">serious New Mexico trucking accident</a>, contact the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. for a FREE case evaluation by calling (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Common Causes of New Mexico Trucking Accidents</b></p><p>As with any motor vehicle accident, there are many potential causes.  These causes can be both due to roadway conditions or driver error, but also in the case of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accidents</a>, due to improper training, experience, or stress.  Some of the most common causes of trucking accidents include the following:</p><ul><li>Driver fatigue – this is a very common cause, as with all trucking operations, time is money;</li><li>Driving too aggressively;</li><li>Failing to maintain the tractor trailer truck, including the brakes, tires, and steering wheel;</li><li>Violating traffic law/not following the rules of the road;</li><li>Driving with an unsecured load or too heavy of a load than permitted by law;</li><li>Failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, such as not speeding through a dust storm; and</li><li>Many other causes.</li></ul><p><b>Contact an Experienced New Mexico Trucking Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico trucking accident</a>, call the <a href="http://www.albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">experienced trucking accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Motor Vehicle Accidents Caused by Improper Overtaking or Passing</b></p><p>Overtaking or passing another motor vehicle on the left is one of the most dangerous maneuvers that a motorist can make.  Essentially, a motorist is driving into the oncoming lane to pass another vehicle.  While there are many stretches of road which permit overtaking or passing on the left, this is still a very risky proposition.  Collisions caused by improper or negligent overtaking or passing on the left can be absolutely catastrophic, particularly when the collision is with an oncoming vehicle or with a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">tractor trailer truck, semi, or other large truck</a>.</p><p>If you or a loved one were seriously injured or killed in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accidents</a> caused by a motorist improperly or negligently overtaking or passing another vehicle on the left, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">experienced Albuquerque motor vehicle accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE case evaluation by calling (505) 883-5000.  We understand how dangerous these types of collision can be, and we will fight for your right to the compensation you desire.</p><p><b>Albuquerque Motor Vehicle Accident Attorney Explains What Happens When a Motorist Fails to Make a “Safe” Overtaking or Passing on the Left</b></p><p>All motorist on the roadway owe others on or near the roadway a duty of reasonable care.  When this duty is breached and caused personal injuries, that motorist may be found negligent.  When a motorist attempts to overtake or pass on the left and fails to safely do so, this is generally a negligent act.  Any other individual injured or killed as a result of this negligent overtaking or passing on the left may be entitled to compensation.</p><p>Similarly, an attempt to overtake or pass on the left which fails and results in a serious motor vehicle accident may be negligent as a matter of law.  <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-310/">Under NM Stat. 66-7-310 (a)</a>, “the driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass to the left  thereof at a <i>safe distance</i> and shall not again drive to the right of the roadway until <i>safely clear</i> of the overtaken vehicle[.]”  (emphasis added.)</p><p>Therefore, if an overtaking or passing on the left is done <i>not safe</i>, and it results in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident causing personal injuries</a>, the motorist attempting to overtake may be negligent as a matter of law under the doctrine of negligence per se.  This doctrine prescribes that a tortfeasor is negligent as a matter of law when the injury causing act was intended to be prohibited by law, and the injured individual(s) is the class of persons intended to be protected by the law.  In this case, the <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-310/">New Mexico Law</a> intends to protect all motorists from unsafe overtaking or passing on the right.  Any accident as a result will likely bring a finding of negligence per se.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque Motor Vehicle Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured or killed in an Albuquerque motor vehicle accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque motor vehicle accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Car Accident Attorney Discusses Liability When Pulling Out of Private Driveway</b></p><p>All motor vehicle accidents can be frustrating—no one plans to be in an accident.  Yet, they are a fact of life.  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Motor vehicle accidents </a>can be particularly frustrating when one driver makes a simple, risky, or unintelligent mistake or error which causes the accident.  One such type of mistake is pulling out of a private driveway, which can sometimes be very difficult on a busy street as there is no signage to assist motorists.  But this is a common place for motor vehicle accidents to occur, and these types of accidents can cause serious injuries or death.</p><p>Here at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C., we understand the frustration that the victim of a car accident may be feeling when another motorist makes a negligent mistake and causes the car accident.  We help to alleviate the stress and burdens a victim may be feeling so he or she can focus on recovery.  If you or a loved one have been seriously injured or killed in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accident</a>, please contact us for a FREE case evaluation by calling (505) 883-5000.</p><p><b>Liability When Pulling Out of a Private Driveway: Albuquerque Car Accident Attorney Explains</b></p><p>A common type of car accident is when a vehicle emerging from a private driveway attempts to merge with traffic and causes an accident.  This can be a difficult maneuver where it is a blind driveway, on a busy road, or on a roadway with a high speed limit.  It can be made even more dangerous when the person emerging from the private driveway is rushing because he or she is late to work or for an appointment.  This is a recipe for serious collisions and debilitating injuries or death, especially if there is a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">tractor trailer truck, semi, or other large truck involved in the accident</a>.</p><p>But there is usually no signage, so what happens when someone pulling out of a private driveway causes a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a>?</p><p>New Mexico law makes it clear on the obligations of motorists and places the blame on the motorist leaving the private driveway.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-346/">NM Stat 66-7-346</a>, the driver of a vehicle emerging from an alley, driveway, or building <i>must</i> stop immediately prior to driving onto a sidewalk or sidewalk area extending across any alleyway or driveway, and <i>must</i> yield to the right-of-way of any pedestrians using the sidewalk and to all approaching vehicles on the roadway.  This section of law makes it clear that vehicles leaving private driveways must first stop and then yield to all other pedestrians and vehicles before attempting to merge.</p><p><b>Motorists Pulling Out of Private Driveways Without Stopping or Yielding Are Negligent</b></p><p>Therefore, if you were on the roadway and a motor vehicle pulled out of a driveway without stopping or yielding to your right-of-way, that merging vehicle may be negligent as a matter of law.  Negligence is where a person breaches a duty of care owed to other people which causes damages.  In this scenario it is clear that a motorist would be negligent by failing to avoid a collision before merging onto the roadway.</p><p>There is also the doctrine of negligence per se, which finds a person negligent for violating a statute which protects against a certain harm and protects a certain class of persons.  Here, any pedestrian or other vehicle on the roadway which is caused injuries due to a motorist pulling out of a private driveway will classify as the certain harm and class of persons.  Meaning, the motorist who pulls out of the private driveway without stopping and yielding may be found to be automatically negligent as a matter of law for violating the statute.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque Car Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured or killed in an Albuquerque car accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Understanding Why Albuquerque Trucking Accidents Are So Deadly: Albuquerque Trucking Accident Attorney Explains</b></p><p>Tractor trailers, semis, and other big trucks are simply larger and heavier when compared to other vehicles on the roadways.  On interstates and highways, their high speed combined with their heavy weight makes tractor trailers, semis, and other big trucks have significant momentum.  If a tractor trailer, semi, or other big truck collides with something, that momentum and energy will be dispersed into whatever it hits.  If that is a smaller passenger car, the occupants of that vehicle will <a href="https://carusolaw.com/accident-attorney-albuquerque/">sustain serious injuries or death</a>.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been serious injured or killed in an <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking accident</a>, contact the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 883-5000.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque trucking accident attorneys</a> will fight for you and your family to get you the maximum compensation you may be entitled to as a result of a <a href="http://albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">trucking accident</a>.</p><p><b>Reasons Why Trucks Are So Dangerous and Cause Serious Personal Injuries </b></p><p>In addition to their sheer size and weight, which are the main reasons why tractor trailers, semis, and other trucks are so dangerous, there are several other reasons why these types of trucks are so dangerous.  These include the following reasons:</p><p><i>Increased Stopping time </i>– Due to their large size and heavy weight, trucks simply require more stopping time.  The faster the truck is going, the more stopping time is required.  This is particularly true on the interstate or highway.  Rain or other inclement weather on the roadway will further increase stopping time.  If the driver is not paying attention or is too slow to stop, this can cause a serious motor vehicle accident.  A common type of accident due to a truck failing to stop on time is a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/injuries-caused-by-albuquerque-rear-end-collision/">rear end collision</a>, which can cause catastrophic damage to a small passenger vehicle.</p><p><i>Blind Spots </i>– Like other vehicles on the road, all trucks have blind spots.  However, due to their sheer size, these blind spots can be significant.  Smaller passenger vehicles or <a href="https://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"><i>motorcycles </i></a>can be easily hidden in these blind spots.  This is dangerous because a truck driver may attempt to perform a maneuver without knowing what other vehicles are around him or her, which may cause a serious accident.</p><p><i>Maneuverability </i>– Unlike smaller vehicles like passenger cars or motorcycles, large tractor trailers, semis, and other big trucks have limited mobility and maneuverability.  It is just simply tougher for these large vehicles to maneuver in smaller areas or around curves.  On the interstate or highway, this limited maneuverability can be dangerous if some lanes are closed due to another accident or construction.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque Trucking Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking accident</a>, call the experienced trucking accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 883-5000.  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Important Steps to Take After a New Mexico Car Accident</b></p><p>No one plans to be in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a>, but there are millions of motor vehicle accidents each year in the United States.  Such accidents could be a minor fender bender or a <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">catastrophic tractor trailer accident</a>.  Regardless of the severity, motor vehicle accidents disrupt the lives of the victims and their entire families.  From undergoing medical care and treatment, missing time from work, and having to pay for the medical treatment and damages, a motor vehicle accident can create a significant hardship on a victim’s entire family.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been the victim of a New Mexico car accident, contact the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> for a FREE consultation with one of our experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys.  We understand the significant hardship that a motor vehicle accident can impose on a victim and his or her family, and we work hard to lift that burden off your shoulders and onto ours so you can focus on healing.  Call us today at (505) 465-8096.</p><p><b>What You Should Do After A New Mexico Car Accident</b></p><p>There are a number of important steps to take after you have been involved in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico car accident</a>.  No matter what, the best advice is to always stay calm and not to get angry, upset, or emotional because that will only worsen the effect of the car accident.  The following are some important key points to keep in mind after a New Mexico car accident:</p><p><i>Attend to Any Injury Persons and Call For Help</i></p><p>If someone has been injured in the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a>, whether it is in your vehicle or another, immediately call for an ambulance.  Do not hesitate, even if you think someone else may have already called an ambulance.</p><p>If you are experienced pain, it is important that you make sure your complaints of injury or pain are documented at the scene by both responding police and emergency medical personnel.  If you are in pain but unsure of how injured you are, go to the hospital for a full examination.  This is not the time to be a hero at the accident scene; any pain—no matter how small—should be reported and assessed.  In some instances, a minor tweak of the back at an accident scene could end up requiring extensive surgery weeks later.</p><p>Getting evaluated is not just important to protect your health, but it is important to protect your rights in <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">pursuing a personal injury claim</a> should you decide to do so.  This is because the opposing side will attack your complaints of pain and whether you went to get evaluated or not after the motor vehicle accident.</p><p><i>If Possible, Take Photographs or Have Someone Else Take Photographs</i></p><p>If you are able to do so, take photographs of the accident scene, the damage to both vehicles, any signage, and any injuries you or a passenger may have.  While almost every cell phone has a camera, sometimes camera batteries are not reliable or they are damaged in the motor vehicle accident.  It is always best to have a disposable camera in your glove box as backup; these are cheap and easy to use.</p><p>If you are unable to take your own photographs, ask for a passenger or a witness at the scene to take photographs and send them to you.  If there is no one available, request that the responding police officer take photographs for the accident report.</p><p><i>Exchange Information</i></p><p>The names, addresses, and telephone number of all drivers, passengers, and witnesses should be exchanged.  The insurance company, license plate number, year, make of the vehicle, and policy number should also be exchanged.</p><p>However, make sure to not sign anything at the scene of the accident, especially with the other driver, injured person(s), or witnesses.  You may be required to sign something with the ambulance or police, and that is permissible, but do not sign anything with any individual or insurance representative after the accident.</p><p><i>Obtain the Police Report</i></p><p>Make sure you take down the name of the responding police officer(s), the department or responding agency, the telephone number, and the accident report number.  It will likely take the police officer a few days to get the accident report drafted and reviewed by a supervisor before it is ready to be published.  As soon as it is, make sure to get a copy.</p><p><i>Write Down a Description of the Accident</i></p><p>As soon as possible after the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a>, write down as many details of the accident as you can remember.  This includes the date, time, road conditions, weather conditions, speed, movement of the vehicles, witnesses, who was driving the other vehicle, and any pains or injuries you may have.  Drawing a diagram of the accident is also helpful.  But make sure that you only share this information with your attorney.</p><p><i>Contact Your Insurance Company and File a Claim</i></p><p>As soon as possible after your motor vehicle accident, contact your insurance company to notify them of the motor vehicle accident.  You will likely need to follow up with a written notice, which should include the circumstances of the accident, date, time, and place.  If there are injuries, you should also provide the injuries.</p><p><i>Contact a New Mexico Car Accident Attorney</i></p><p>Even if you think it may have been your fault, or even if you think that you may not have been seriously injured, always contact a New Mexico car accident attorney to review the circumstances of your motor vehicle accident and assess whether you have a right to compensation.  This should be done as soon as practicable, and if possible even before you contact your insurance company as your attorney can help navigate you through that process or handle it for you.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced New Mexico Car Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured or killed in a New Mexico car accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 384-6322  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Motor Vehicle Accident Attorneys Explains New Mexico’s Texting While Driving Offense</b></p><p>According to distraction.gov, the official U.S. Government Website for Distracted Driving, in 2014 <a href="http://www.distraction.gov/stats-research-laws/facts-and-statistics.html">over 3,100 people were killed and 431,000 people were injured</a> in distracted driving motor vehicle accidents.  These numbers increased from the year before, and the trend has been on the rise from the years prior to that.</p><p>Distracted driving due to cell phone use is also steadily increasing, particularly for new drivers in their teens and in their twenties.  This age range of drivers accounts for the vast majority of all distracted driving accidents, especially due to cell phone use while driving.  According to the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov">National Highway Transportation Safety Administration</a>, <a href="http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/812132.pdf">motor vehicle accident caused by a cell phone in use kill over 450 people year</a> each in the United States.</p><p>Motor vehicle accidents caused by cell phone use and other distractions are all very preventable.  Because of this, most times when there is a distracted driving accident the driver who is distracted is negligent as a matter of law.  This is particularly true in New Mexico for texting while driving, which has been <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">codified as a violation of the traffic law</a>.  This allows the victim(s) of an Albuquerque texting while driving accident to recover the compensation they deserve to help them recover from their injuries.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured or killed in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque texting while driving motor vehicle accident</a>, contact the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. for a FREE consultation.  Our <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque motor vehicle accident attorneys</a> can explain your rights and review your case to see what compensation you may be entitled to.  Call us today at (505) 966-9308.</p><p><b>New Mexico Law Prohibits Texting While Driving</b></p><p>New Mexico law prohibits a motorist from texting while driving.  Under <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">NM 66-7-374</a>, “[a] person shall not read or view a text message or manually type on a handheld mobile communication device for any purpose while driving a motor vehicle, except to summon medical or other emergency help or unless that device is an amateur radio and the driver holds a valid amateur radio operator license issued by the federal communications commission.”</p><p>Further, this section defines “driving” as “being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway or street and includes being temporarily stopped because of traffic, a traffic light or stop sign or otherwise, but ‘driving’ excludes operating a motor vehicle when the vehicle has pulled over to the side of or off of an active roadway and has stopped at a location in which it can safely remain stationary[.]”</p><p>Additionally, this section defines “text message” to include any instant message, electronic mail (e-mail), any text or image communication, or any command or request to an internet site.  Thus, this section would also preclude any of the popular apps such as Facebook or Snapchat, which send images or videos as a form of communication rather than just text.</p><p><b>Liability in Albuquerque Texting While Driving Accidents</b></p><p>Where a motorist violates <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-374/">NM 66-7-374</a> and texts while driving, and such violation causes a Albuquerque motor vehicle accident, the violating motorist may be negligent or negligent per se.</p><p>Negligence is where a person owes a duty of care to another, breaches that duty of care, and such breach causes damages to another person.  This is a common law theory of liability, which is judge made law, and is the common theory in most personal injury accidents—including <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accidents</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, since there is a statute prohibiting certain conduct, the motorist violating the texting while driving law may be negligent per se.  This theory of liability is premised off of a statutory violation which will automatically find the violator negligent as a matter of law if the statute protects against the harm which was caused to the person(s) protected by the statute.  Meaning here, the statute protects against distracted driving accidents (this is the harm).  It protects other people on or near the roadway (the person(s) protected by the statute).  Thus, when a motorist violates the texting while driving statute and causes a motor vehicle accident, the theory of negligence per se will allow victims to recover for their injuries by finding the violator negligent.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque Texting While Driving Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a

<p><b>Understanding Common Types of Albuquerque Motorcycle Accidents</b></p><p>Simply put, motorcyclists are more vulnerable than any other vehicle on the road.  They are smaller in size and are not protected in a shell of metal.  Basic safety protections such as seat belts, airbags, side curtains, rollover bars, or other innovations do not exist to help keep motorcyclists from harm.  Because of this, motorcyclists are significantly more likely to be seriously injured or killed in even the most innocuous of motor vehicle accidents.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque motorcycle accident</a>, contact the <a href="/">Caruso Law Offices, P.C.</a> today for a FREE consultation by calling (505) 384-6312.  We are <a href="https://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">experienced Albuquerque motorcycle accident attorneys</a> who will fight to get you the compensation you are entitled to so you can focus on healing.</p><p><b>Types of Albuquerque Motorcycle Accidents</b></p><p>Due to the inherent disadvantages of motorcycles as opposed to larger vehicles, there are many different types of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motorcycle accidents</a> which can easily prove fatal or cause catastrophic <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Personal injuries</a>.  Unfortunately, many of these types of motorcycle accidents are caused due to the errors of other motorists which are easily preventable.  Because of this, most <a href="https://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motorcycle accidents</a> are caused by the negligence of another motorist.</p><p>Negligence is a legal theory of liability wherein a person breaches a duty of care owed to another person, and such breach causes damages.  Thus, when a motorist makes a preventable error while driving, it is very likely that he or she was negligent.</p><p>Some common types of negligent <a href="https://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motorcycle accidents</a> include the following:</p><p><b>Vehicle Turning Left in Front of You</b> – When another vehicle fails to judge your distance and speed but still turns left in front of you, thus causing you to either t-bone such vehicle or swerve to avoid, this is generally caused by the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/left-hand-turn-car-accidents-at-intersections-albuquerque-car-accident-attorney-discusses-liability/"><b>negligence of the left turning vehicle</b></a>.  These types of motorcycle accidents are one of the most common, and also one of the most deadly.</p><p><b>Vehicle Changes Lanes Into You</b> – When another vehicle suddenly veers into your lane or into the space next to your motorcycle, this can result in a very serious accident and personal injuries.  This is particularly dangerous on the highway where both you and the other motorist will be naturally traveling at high speeds.  The cause of this type of accident is usually driver inattention or failing to check the blind spots properly because merging.  Unsafe lane changes are prohibited by New Mexico law and will lead to liability.</p><p><b>Vehicle Rear Ends You</b> – While a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/injuries-caused-by-albuquerque-rear-end-collision/"><b>rear end motor vehicle accident </b></a>may not be as damaging to a passenger vehicle or truck, when a motorcycle is rear ended it can launch a rider from the bike and directly onto the ground or into a lane of oncoming traffic.  Even low speed rear end collisions can cause a motorcyclist to sustain serious personal injuries.  The vehicle which rear ends another vehicle is <a href="https://carusolaw.com/injuries-caused-by-albuquerque-rear-end-collision/"><b>generally negligent as a matter of law</b></a>.</p><p><b>A Parked Car Opens a Vehicle Into You </b>– It is not just moving vehicles which can be a hazard.  In narrow lanes, commonly while driving through small towns or tight shopping areas, a motorcyclists can be seriously injured when an occupant of a parked car fails to judge your distance and speed and opens a door into your lane of travel.  This can cause you to fall over into the oncoming lane of travel causing even worse injuries.</p><p><b>Contact an

<p><b>Serious Injuries or Death Caused by Different Types of Albuquerque Truck Accidents</b></p><p>The <a href="http://www.albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">most dangerous vehicles on the roads are tractor trailers, semis, commercial trucks, and other large vehicles</a>.  These vehicles generate a lot of momentum due to their massive size combined with their speed on an interstate.  When they collide with a passenger vehicle, this significant momentum is disbursed throughout the smaller vehicle and the occupants therein.  It goes without saying that this extreme exertion of force can easily cause serious injury or death to any passenger in the other vehicle.</p><p>At the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">Caruso Law Office, P.C.</a>, we understand how devastating <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">Albuquerque trucking accidents</a> can be.  We have experience handling some catastrophic trucking accidents, and fought hard to get the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/testimonials/">compensation our clients deserved</a>.  If you or a loved one has been injured in an Albuquerque truck accident, call us today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 384-6322.</p><p><b>Types of Trucking Accidents Caused by Negligence</b></p><p>Negligence is when an individual or entity breaches a duty which causes damages to another.  While not every type of trucking accident is caused by the negligence of the truck company or truck driver, there are many types of trucking accidents which <i>are </i>very likely the result of negligence.  In fact, some types of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accidents</a> are almost always due to the negligence of the truck company or truck driver.</p><p>Some examples of common truck accidents which are caused by the negligence of a truck company or driver include the following:</p><p><b><i>Jackknife accidents</i></b> – this is when a semi-truck brakes too quickly and too hard which causes the trailer to swing outward and forward at a rate faster than the truck’s cab, thus causing the cab to turn toward the trailer and forming an acute angle.  Jackknife accidents are dangerous because the trailer can swing and strike multiple vehicles along the road.  It can also force vehicles underneath the trailer or the tires, which can cause catastrophic damage to anything caught in its path.</p><p><b><i>Tire blowouts</i></b><i> </i>– just as it sounds, a tire blowout is where the tire fails and essentially disintegrates into a mess of shredded rubber while the truck is still moving.  For a large truck, a tire blowout can be devastating because the shear size and weight of a truck makes it very difficult to control creating the potential to collide with other vehicles.</p><p><b><i>Air brake failures</i> </b>– when a truck’s air brakes fail, the truck essentially becomes a massive unguided missile on the roadway.  This is particularly dangerous when there is heavy traffic or when the truck is traveling downhill.</p><p><b><i>Under-ride accidents</i></b><i> </i>– any vehicle that suddenly stops short runs the risk of causing the vehicles behind them to rear-end them.  However, when a tractor trailer stops short, another vehicle behind the truck, most likely a smaller passenger vehicle, collides and can slide under the bottom of the truck.  For obvious reasons, this can cause serious personal injuries.</p><p><b><i>Truck rollovers </i></b><i>– </i>commonly a result of turning too quickly, when a truck rolls over onto its side it has significant crushing ability to pulverize anything underneath it.  This can literally flatten other vehicles and cause severe injuries, most likely death.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque Trucking Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque trucking accident</a>, call the <a href="http://www.albuquerqueaccidentattorney.blogspot.com">experienced trucking accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 384-6322  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Serious Motor Vehicle Accidents Cause Serious Broken Bones</b></p><p>One of the most common types of injuries following a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accident</a> is a broken bone.  It can also be one of the most painful types of injuries.  Broken bones can occur in any type of motor vehicle accident, including rear end collisions, head on crashes, and t-bone collisions.  Broken bones can also occur at any speed, even low speeds in parking lots.</p><p>If a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">New Mexico motor vehicle accident</a> has caused a broken bone to you or a loved one, call the experienced Albuquerque New Mexico motor vehicle accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 859-7046.  We understand that broken bones are very painful and may require a lot of medical treatment, including surgery.  We will fight to get you the compensation you deserve.</p><p><b>Understanding Broken Bones in Albuquerque Motor Vehicle Accidents</b></p><p>The medical term for a broken bone is a fracture.  Fractures are diagnosed by a medical professional from an x-ray.  Fractures from motor vehicle accidents can occur anywhere on the broken, from the tip of your toe, pelvis and hip, spinal bones (vertebrae), to your head (jaw and skull).  There are several different types of fractures, which include the following:</p><ul><li>Transverse fracture – the broken bone has a horizontal fracture line;</li><li>Oblique fracture – the broken bone has an angled pattern;</li><li>Comminuted fracture – the broken bone matters into three or more pieces;</li><li>Open fracture or compound fracture – the broken bone pierces through the skin or the force of the broken bone causes an open wound;</li><li>Stress fracture – the broken bone has a hairline crack in it;</li><li>Greenstick fracture – this broken bone occurs when there’s a crack on one side of a bone that doesn’t go all the way through it;</li><li>Complete fracture – this type of fracture is when a bone is completely broken; and</li><li>Stable fracture – this type of fracture is where the end of the broken bone are lined up and barely out of place.</li></ul><p>Some of these types of broken bones will require what is known as a “reduction.”  A reduction is simply when the medical professional realigns the broken bone.  This can be done as a closed reduction, just manipulated the broken bone without the necessity of surgery.  Or this can be done as an open reduction, which required surgical intervention.  In the case of an open reduction, there is usually painful hardware added to keep the bones in place.</p><p><b>Understanding Spinal Fractures Caused by Albuquerque Motor Vehicle Accidents</b></p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/spinal-cord-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Spinal fractures</a> are very dangerous and painful injuries to sustain, but are very common in motor vehicle accidents.  This is particularly true of <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">tractor trailer or large commercial trucking accidents</a>, where the shear mass and speed of these massive vehicles can cause catastrophic damage to whatever they collide with.</p><p>The spine is made up of a column of bones called vertebrae; this column of bones is known a the vertebral column.  Each individual vertebra sit on top of each other and from from the pelvis to the base of the school.  The spinal cord is in the middle of the vertebral column, and the vertebrae protect the spinal cord from damage.</p><p>These vertebrae are very strong and can withstand significant force.  However, they can still be injured in a motor vehicle accident and fractured like any other type of bone.  There are several different types of spinal fractures, and the more common and basic types include the following:</p><ul><li>Compression fracture – when the individual vertebra is broken and loses height, commonly forming a “wedge” shape when the front of the vertebra fractures but the back of the vertebra does not;</li><li>Burst fracture – when the individual vertebra is crushed by extreme force, common in motor vehicle accidents;</li><li>Flexion-distraction fractures – when several vertebrae fracture due to the spinal flexing forward due to a sudden force, such as a motor vehicle accident; and</li><li>Fracture-dislocation – anytime when a vertebra (or vertebrae) move significantly after being fractured.</li></ul><p>Many times with spinal fractures there will need to be multiple x-rays and MRIs performed to check on the safety of the spinal cord.  This is because <a href="https://carusolaw.com/understanding-spinal-cord-injuries-caused-by-a-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accident/">spinal cord injuries</a> usually occur when a vertebra (or vertebrae) are fractured or otherwise damaged.  As a result, extensive surgery is often required to repair the damage done.</p><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque Broken Bones Motor Vehicle Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in a motor vehicle accident and suffered broken bones, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com">experienced Albuquerque motor vehicle accident attorneys </a>at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 384-6322  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Albuquerque Rear End Accident Attorney</b></p><p>One of the most common types of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">motor vehicle accidents</a> is a rear end collision.  These crashes can be caused by a variety of factors, such as districted driving, following too closely, or speeding.  Due to the nature of the collision, rear end accidents can cause serious injuries, particularly to the neck and back.  Even at low speeds, rear end collisions can be dangerous and cause debilitating injuries.</p><p>Of course, the bigger and heavier the vehicle the more catastrophic the injuries.  This is why Albuquerque rear end accidents caused by <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">large trucks, tractor trailers, commercial trucks</a>, buses, or other large vehicles can cause significant injuries.  The shear momentum of these types of vehicles causes such destructive force that personal injuries are almost always the result of a truck rear end collision.</p><p>If you or a loved one have been injured in a rear end accident, contact the Caruso Law Offices to speak with an <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque rear end accident attorney</a> for a FREE consultation by calling (505) 847 3206.  We understand what it takes to protect your rights and ensure you get the compensation you are entitled to.</p><p><b>Proving Liability in Rear End Accidents</b></p><p>Generally under New Mexico law, the vehicle that crashes into the rear end of another vehicle is negligent and liable for the accident and any injuries related to such accident.  This negligence is both through common law, which is judge made law, and through a violation of a statute, known as negligence per se.</p><p>The applicable statute is <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-318/">NM Stat Section 66-7-318</a>, which governs following too closely, and provides under subdivision (A) that “[t]he driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.”  When a vehicle crashes into the back of another vehicle, generally it is considered to have followed too closely than is reasonable and prudent thus creating liability.</p><p><b>Injuries Caused by Albuquerque Rear End Accidents</b></p><p>The victim of a rear end collision, even at low speeds, can suffer significant and debilitating injuries.  This is because the force of the impact and momentum is coming from behind, and can create whiplash injuries stressing the spine.  Some common types of injuries caused by rear end include the following:</p><ul><li>Whiplash injuries;</li><li>Herniated discs;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/brain-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">Traumatic brain injuries</a>;</li><li>Facial disfigurement;</li><li>Lacerations;</li><li><a href="https://carusolaw.com/understanding-spinal-cord-injuries-caused-by-a-albuquerque-motor-vehicle-accident/">Spinal Cord Injuries</a>;</li><li>Broken bones;</li><li>Nerve impingement;</li><li>Ruptured discs;</li><li>Paralysis;</li><li>Death; and</li><li>Other related injuries.</li></ul><p><b>Contact an Experienced Albuquerque Rear End Accident Attorney</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been injured in an Albuquerque rear end accident, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 384-6322  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Dangerous Left Hand Turn <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque Car Accidents</a></b></p><p>Left hand turns are one of the most dangerous maneuvers that a motorist can make.  This is particularly true when the left turn is over multiple lanes of travel, entering onto the roadway, turning into a parking lot, during inclement weather, or at an intersection.  In fact, making a left hand turn at an intersection is probably <i>the</i> most dangerous maneuver that a motorist can make.</p><p>There are many left hand turn <a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Albuquerque car accidents </a>which cause serious injuries or even death due to the negligence of drivers.  Some of the most serious left hand turn collisions involve <a href="https://www.nmtruckaccidentattorneys.com">New Mexico truck accidents</a> turning left too slow or at the last second.  These can cause catastrophic injuries or even death.</p><p>If you or a loved one were injured in a car accident caused by another driver making a left hand turn at an intersection, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries.  Call the experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys at the Caruso Law Offices for a FREE consultation by dialing (505) 384-6322 or using the convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact us box on our website</a>.  We fight to protect your rights so you can focus on your recovery.</p><p><b>Left Hand Turn Albuquerque Car Accidents Caused by Negligence</b></p><p>Car accidents are a type of negligence case.  Negligence cases require a showing there was a duty, a breach of such duty, causation, and damages.</p><p>Under the common law, or judge made law, all motorists owe others on or near the roadway a duty to drive safely and use reasonable care in the use and operation of their motor vehicle.  When a motorist causes a car accident by making an improper left hand turn, he or she may be found to have breached that duty and may be liable for the damages he or she caused as a result of the car accident.</p><p>Further, <a href="/">New Mexico law</a> understands the dangers of intersections and left hand turns at intersections and imposes protections for motorists to follow.  <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-328/">NM Statute section 66-7-328 regulates vehicles approaching intersections</a>, and requires those approaching the intersection to yield to the right-of-way of vehicles already in the intersection.  <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2015/chapter-66/article-7/part-4/section-66-7-329/">Section 66-7-329 specifically governs vehicles turning left at intersections</a>, and requires these vehicles to yield to the right-of-way of all oncoming vehicles which constitute an “immediate hazard” to allow safe passage.  This effectively requires vehicles turning left to turn last.</p><p>In addition to being negligence as noted above, a motorist who violates one of these sections of New Mexico law may be found to be negligence per se.  Under the legal doctrine of negligence per se, the violator of a statute may be found negligent as a matter of law (simply because the act occurred) for a violation causing injuries if the statute intended to 1) protect the person injured, and 2) prevent the action causing the injury.</p><p>Violations of both statutes above are generally negligence per se and may entitle victims to compensation for their injuries.</p><p><b>Albuquerque Car Accident Attorneys Protecting Your Rights</b></p><p>If you or a loved one has been seriously injured or killed in a l<a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">eft hand turn Albuquerque car accident</a>, call the <a href="https://carusolaw.com/firm-overview/">experienced Albuquerque car accident attorneys</a> at the Caruso Law Offices, P.C. today by dialing (505) 384-6322  You can also contact us on our website through the easy to use and convenient <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact box located by clicking here</a>.</p>

TITLE: Semi-Truck Accidents on New Mexico Highways Are Too Common
DATE: 11/09/2015 12:00:00 00:00:00

BODY:
<p>If you have recently traveled on Interstate 25 or Interstate 40 in New Mexico you know that semi-truck traffic is heavy and dangerous. Big tractor trailers and 18 wheelers dominate New Mexico highways. Whether it’s a big rig cutting in front of you from the right lane into your lane of traffic and forcing you to slam on your brakes or the dangerously speeding semi-truck that passes you like you were standing still, interstate truck drivers passing thru New Mexico really think they “own the road!”  It’s for this reason that you must drive defensively on our state’s highways and interstates when near a semi-truck.</p><p>Too often semi-trucks are the cause of serious injuries and fatalities.  Their big rigs are no comparison for the family vehicles most of us drive. With tens of thousands of pounds of weight, they smash our family cars like tin cans.  Individuals and families could have been spared the trauma and pain of the collision if the truck driver would have driven more responsibly and carefully through our state. Sometimes the blame is on the driver, but sometimes the blame is on the trucking company itself for negligently hiring the driver, failing to maintain the semi-truck and failing to train and discipline the truck driver.   Unfortunately, there has been an increase in truck drivers from Mexico and Mexican trucking companies on our state’s highways because of changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that have allowed non-US licensed drivers to transport into the United States.</p><p>While there are several larger trucking companies such as Swift, Old Dominion, Covenant, FedEx Freight, etc on our state’s highways, there are also many smaller companies. Almost all of these trucking companies are based out of state.</p><p>Because of the familiarity of trucking companies in dealing with highway <strong><a href="https://carusolaw.com/accident-attorney-albuquerque/">Accidents</a></strong> and collisions, their truck drivers are trained by their managers on specifically what to tell the State Police, Sheriff and New Mexico Department of Transportation investigating officers. The trucking company and the driver will say or do whatever is necessary to help them avoid liability for the collision. Certain evidence may disappear after the collision if the investigating officer fails to secure the evidence at the scene. The NM-DOT is especially good at securing the evidence and inspecting the semi-truck for defects and violations.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is important to act quickly if you or a family member are involved in a <a href="https://carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">commercial trucking accident</a> with a semi-truck, tractor trailer or 18 wheeler. An investigator should immediately be retained on your behalf to collect the evidence from the investigating authorities, inspect and photograph the damage to the vehicle, inspect the log books, and dot every “i” and cross every “t” to establish the liability of the truck driver and the trucking company.</p><p>Most of the trucking accidents that have been handled by our firm involve driver fatigue and violations of state and federal trucking laws. Often times the collisions involve a driver not checking his side mirror before changing lanes or speeding too fast for conditions. There are specific rules requiring a truck driver to reduce speed when certain weather conditions are present–for example rain, snow, ice or black ice.</p><p><a href="/">Caruso Law Offices</a> has represented hundreds of clients with claims against trucking companies. We only represent individuals with claims for personal injury and wrongful death.  Because we focus our entire law practice exclusively on personal injury and wrongful death, we are particularly good at what we do. We have the trucking experts and investigators ready to assure successful settlements and litigation.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been in a commercial trucking accident, call <a href="https://carusolaw.com/attorney-profile/mark-caruso/">Mark Caruso</a> at 505-883-5000 for a free and confidential consultation.

BODY:
<p>Thousands of traffic accidents each year involve commercial trucks and trailers. These incidents occur involving heavy duty trucks and rigs such as:</p><ul><li>Tractor-trailers and semi-trucks engaged in interstate hauling</li><li>Dump trucks working at construction sites</li><li>Garbage and trash trucks removing a city’s refuse</li><li>Delivery trucks transporting products to store customers</li></ul><p>Their owners and operators are all governed by common rules when it comes to establishing liability for the negligence in the operation of their vehicles.</p><p>Each state has its own vehicle code and case law developed over the years.  While these individual state laws may differ, the bottom line is that there must be negligence by the operator of the truck in the operation of the truck.</p><h2>Negligence and Liability</h2><p>Negligence is defined as careless conduct.  That means conduct which falls below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm.  Negligence alone, however, does not establish liability.  An injured person must also show a duty owed by the driver to the injured person, a breach of that duty and an injury caused by the breach of the duty.</p><p>A diesel truck driver must exercise reasonable care to prevent injuries to a person within the vehicle’s path.  If the truck driver fails to do so, the driver, his employer and the truck’s owner is responsible for the slightest deviation from reasonable care.  If a truck driver disregards the safety of others in the operation of his vehicle, this is considered a breach of duty of care.</p><h2>Commercial Trucking Standards</h2><p>While all drivers are required to know the rules of the road before getting into a vehicle, truck drivers are in a very special situation.  18-wheelers are heavier and more cumbersome than an automobile.  If it is involved in a collision, it can cause more damage, greater injuries and even death. It is also a more complex piece of machinery than an automobile and it takes greater expertise to understand how to operate and drive it.</p><p>Truck drivers spend more time on the highway than most other drivers.  Many of them engaged in long-distance hauling sleep in and live out of their trucks.  These types of drivers, in particular, are under enormous pressure to deliver their cargo in a timely fashion.  They encounter different road hazards and weather conditions requiring them to drive in a clear-headed fashion or risk disaster.  A lapse of momentary careless will cause a collision.</p><p>The big-rig itself is an additional source of problems.  Improperly maintained brakes, worn tires and other unsafe equipment may cause failures in a truck’s operation causing its owner and driver liability for property damage, personal injuries and wrongful death.</p><p>The New Mexico Motor Transportation Division (NM-DOT) carefully monitors commercial trucking in New Mexico for the protection of all New Mexicans.  The Mission Statement of the NM-DOT states that its job is, “To promote safety on New Mexico highways by providing law enforcement traffic services to the motoring public, to ensure the safe and legal operation of commercial motor vehicles and to prevent the introduction of illicit contraband into New Mexico while facilitating trade.” The mission is accomplished by enforcing the NM Criminal Code, Motor Transportation Act, Motor Vehicle Code and federal/state commercial motor vehicle safety regulations.</p><p>Sometimes a commercial truck driver’s negligence is so severe that it reaches a different level in negligence and may expose the driver and his company to punitive damages.  This conscious wrongdoing may be considered gross negligence or willful and wonton misconduct. One such industry-wide area that may subject a truck driver to punitive damages is driver fatigue.  All too often there is a conscious decision by the owners and shippers to place high demands on performance from the driver that cannot be accomplished without violating federal maximum driving hour regulations.</p><p><em>Caruso Law Offices is an Albuquerque based personal injury and wrongful death law firm that represents the victims of accidents due to a truck driver’s negligence. For additional information regarding our attorneys and our firm please see our <a href="https://www.carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">trucking accident page</a> or contact us directly for a free consultation at 505-883-5000.  We represent clients throughout the state of New Mexico in state and federal court.</em></p><p> </p>

<h3>Accident and Collision Reports by Albuquerque Police Department and Bernalillo Sheriff Department for Auto, Truck, Motorcycle, Bicycle and Pedestrian Injuries</h3><div><p><span style="font-size: small;">By Mark Caruso, Personal Injury and Wrongful Death Attorney (Albuquerque, NM)</span></p></div><p> </p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jT7D4GS6xmk/UWaKhIPKMDI/AAAAAAAAAZM/ScW0hoh8nnA/s1600/police+at+scene.jpg"><noscript><img class="alignnone" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jT7D4GS6xmk/UWaKhIPKMDI/AAAAAAAAAZM/ScW0hoh8nnA/s200/police+at+scene.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" border="0" /></noscript></a></p><p> </p><p>The police report, accident report or crash collision report prepared by the <b>Albuquerque Police Department </b>(APD) or <b>Bernalillo County Sheriff Department</b> (BCSO) is the best way to <em>determine who was at fault for your car<a href="https://carusolaw.com/car-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"> accident</a>,  <a href="https://www.carusolaw.com/truck-accident-attorney-albuquerque/">truck accident</a> or motorcycle<a href="https://carusolaw.com/motorcycle-accident-attorney-albuquerque/"> accident</a></em>.</p><p> </p><p>If you have been in an accident in the Albuquerque area, then most likely an APD officer or Sheriff deputy showed up at the scene to investigate the accident and prepare the accident report.</p><p> </p><h4>At the scene, the officer talked with the drivers of the vehicles and any witnesses who presented themselves to him/her with information about the collision.</h4><p> </p><p>The officer most likely took handwritten notes of the individuals which will be typed on to a computer form. The officer will also assess the amount of damage and location of the damage to the vehicles and other property that might have been involved.  The officer will also look for other physical evidence such as skid marks, broken glass.  Most importantly the officer will assess the actual location of the accident taking into consideration the number of lanes, traffic control devices like stop signs and traffic signals and the amount of traffic. The officer will also note any complaints of <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">personal injuries</a> from the collision.</p><p> </p><h4>Based on his/her own training and the laws of the state of New Mexico, the officer will determine which driver was at fault.  In some instances, the officer will cite one of the drivers.</h4><p> </p><p>Normally the officer will not give each driver any information on the other driver.  Instead, the officer will give you his/her business card with the accident report record locator number written on the card.  The officer will tell you that the accident report will be available in 7 to 10 days.</p><p> </p><p>The APD officer or Sheriff deputy will then enter all the information from the handwritten notes on to a computerized form approved by the State of New Mexico.  The report includes all of the information discussed above, but the report has a separate section called “<strong>Contributing Factors</strong>“.  It is this section that is the most important section of the report, because it determines who is at fault for the collision.</p><p> </p><p>Let me explain to you how to read this section.</p><p> </p><p>Each “Contributing Factors” section on the accident report identifies a specific vehicle such as vehicle 1, vehicle 2, vehicle 3, etc. You will need to look at the first few pages of the accident report to determine which driver and vehicle you are to determine which section of the “Contributing Factors” applies to you.  So, if you are vehicle/driver one on page 1 of the report, then your “Contributing Factors” are only those listed for a vehicle on about page 3 of the report.</p><p> </p><p>A perfect notation in the section would be something like “No Contributing Factor” or “None” meaning that you did absolutely nothing to cause the collision.  Other notations like “Speeding Too Fast for Conditions” or “Failing to Yield” or “Disregarding Traffic Controls” mean that you caused the collision.</p><p> </p><h4>In my experience as a personal injury attorney, I believe that the “Contributing Factor” section of the accident report is the primary factor that insurance companies and attorneys use to determine who is at fault.</h4><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6YyMraovgcQ/UYAVHxUsjXI/AAAAAAAAAe8/jP0zmAjA1bg/s1600/AlbuquerquePoliceDepartmentCar.jpg"><noscript><img class="alignnone" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6YyMraovgcQ/UYAVHxUsjXI/AAAAAAAAAe8/jP0zmAjA1bg/s320/AlbuquerquePoliceDepartmentCar.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="167" border="0" /></noscript></a></p><p>It is very difficult to get an insurance company to reject the findings of the officer unless the officer clearly made a mistake and reversed the parties. (This does happen!)</p><p> </p><p>The officer is the best person to make a decision on who is at fault for the vehicular collision.  He is at the scene minutes after the collision. The officer can judge the character of the drivers and witnesses to help determine who he/she believes is telling the truth.  The officer sees the physical evidence and the location first hand.</p><p> </p><p>If you review the accident report prepared by the officer and find errors, you can file a supplemental report to be attached to the accident report. You can do so by taking the original report with you to the local APD or BCSO office and requesting a supplemental sheet.  You can handwrite your version of the collision together with the accident report number appearing on the original accident report and submit it to the staff at the office.</p><p> </p><p>Witnesses who are not listed on the accident report are not very credible.  The exception is the witness who may be noted on the 911 transcript. It is important to get a copy of the transcript from the APD or BCSO if the fault of one of the parties is important.</p><p> </p><p>Often times the transcript will indicate that a particular witness used his/her cell phone to report an accident that they actually witnessed.  However, because of time constraints they did not stop to talk with the individuals involved or wait for the investigating officer.</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5m_KYRY4mQ/UYAVSGu8wJI/AAAAAAAAAfE/S727otlN5EA/s1600/photo.png"><noscript><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5m_KYRY4mQ/UYAVSGu8wJI/AAAAAAAAAfE/S727otlN5EA/s1600/photo.png" alt="" border="0" /></noscript></a></p><p>If you have questions concerning your vehicle accident please contact <a href="/Contact.shtml">Caruso Law Offices </a>at 505-883-5000 for a free consultation.  Also, visit our web site at  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/">www.carusolaw.com</a>   We only handle  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/personal-injury-attorney-albuquerque/">personal injury</a>  and  <a href="https://carusolaw.com/wrongful-death-attorney-albuquerque/">wrongful death</a>  cases as a result of a car, truck, motorcycle, bus, bicycle or pedestrian accidents.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Call Caruso Law Offices to help you with your  APD accident report, APD collision report, APD police report, BCSO accident report, BCSO collision report, BCSO police report, Bernalillo Sheriff Department accident report, Bernalillo Sheriff Department collision report, Bernalillo Sheriff Department police report, Bernalillo County Sheriff Department accident report, Bernalillo County Sheriff Department collision report, Bernalillo County Sheriff Department police report, accident report, police report, collision report, NM State Police accident report, NM State Police collision report, NM State Police report, NM Department of Transportation accident report, NM Department of Transportation collision report, NM Department of Transportation investigation report, lawyer, lawyers, attorney, attorneys, personal injury, injury, car accident, truck accident, motorcycle accident, bicycle accident, car collision, truck collision, motorcycle collision, bicycle collision, pedestrian collision, car wreck, truck wreck, motorcycle wreck, bicycle wreck, pedestrian wreck, auto accident, auto collision, auto wreck, personal injury attorney, injury attorney, Mark Caruso, Caruso Law Offices, car accident attorney, car accident lawyer, truck accident attorney, truck accident lawyer, motorcycle accident attorney, motorcycle accident lawyer, bicycle accident attorney, bicycle accident lawyer, pedestrian accident attorney, pedestrian accident lawyer, who is at fault, who caused the accident, insurance claim, insurance settlement, attorney to fight the insurance company, lawyer to fight the insurance company, contingency fee, discount contingency fee, reduced contingency fee, contingency fee code, wrongful death claims</p><p> </p>

This is unprecedented in Albuquerque, and we were the first Albuquerque Personal Injury and Wrongful Death Attorney to make such a discount.  Most every other personal injury attorney still charges the full 33 1/3% attorney fee.</p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/discount-fee_o.gif"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-649" alt="discount-fee_o" src="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/discount-fee_o.gif" width="263" height="72" /></noscript></a></p><p>This discount applies to all personal injury and wrongful death cases handled by the firm including accidents and collisions involving auto, truck, semi-truck, 18 wheeler, tractor trailer, commercial vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, buses, pedestrians and to all types of injuries including head trauma, brain injury, spinal cord injury, broken bones, soft tissue injury, psychological injury including PTSD.</p><p>*************</p><p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>**The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> formula</span> for the discounted fee is simple.  </strong></em></span></p><h3><strong>At the conclusion of the pre-litigation settlement only 29% is deducted for attorney fees, not 33 1/3%.</strong></h3><p>The math is simple, but the additional pocket money for the client can be enormous!</p><p>*************</p><p><strong><span style="color: #993300;"><em>**The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> rationale</span> behind the discounted fee is simple.</em></span></strong></p><h3><strong>Caruso spends less money on expensive advertising.</strong></h3><p>Caruso Law Offices doesn’t spend tens of thousands of dollars per month on television, radio, billboard and bus advertising.  Because of the reduced advertising overhead, Caruso can discount the fee and put more money in the client’s pocket. You don’t really benefit from this advertising.  In fact, some jury polls indicate that juries don’t like lawyers who advertise on television, radio, billboards and sides of buses.  There is some evidence that they will award you less money because of who you have representing you in the courtroom.</p><p>Caruso cites the NM Lawyers’ Rules of Professional Responsibility which permit the attorney to charge only  a reasonable attorney fee based on the amount and kind of work performed. If the amount of work is less, why shouldn’t the fees to the attorney be less.  All attorneys should be following Caruso Law Offices example of the discounted fee.  Some attorneys have no begun copying Caruso’s discounted fees.</p><p>*************</p><p><strong><span style="color: #993300;"><em>**The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">result</span> of the discounted fee is simple.</em></span></strong></p><h3><strong>A discounted attorney fee means more money in the client’s pocket and less money in the attorney’s pocket at the end of the case. </strong></h3><p>At the settlement of your case you are happier with our firm because you see more money going into your pocket with the discounted attorney fee.</p><p>*************</p><p>Caruso continues to handle the property damage settlements and rental car for free.</p><h2>A discounted fee does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> mean discounted services.</h2><p>Mark Caruso has been practicing law since 1982–that’s 31 years.  An honors graduate of Pepperdine University School of Law, Mark is licensed in both California and New Mexico. He has been successfully  handling personal injury and wrongful death cases for 31 years.   As a former insurance company attorney, Mark Caruso knows the ins-and-outs of the insurance claims business to get his clients the most money possible.  He now uses that experience to help his clients against the same insurance companies. The lawyers and staff at Caruso Law Offices have been expertly trained by one of the best personal injury and wrongful death attorneys in New Mexico.   There is no sacrafice in quality legal representation just because of the discounted fee.</p><p><strong>A discounted fee just means more money in your pocket when you settle your case.</strong></p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/no-recovery-no-fee_o.gif"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-651" alt="no-recovery-no-fee_o" src="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/no-recovery-no-fee_o.gif" width="263" height="91" /></noscript></a></p><p>Caruso Law Offices gets new client referrals from prior clients, other non-personal injury attorneys, out of state attorneys, doctors, body shops and even insurance agents.  These make up the majority of Caruso’s clients.  Some clients are attracted to the lower percentage attorney fee.  Others are attracted to his experience as a former insurance company  attorney who now works for the victims against these same insurance companies.  Still others look at the high client ratings and testimonials as evidence of good work for their clients.</p><p><strong> <span style="color: #993300;">Because  the attorney does less work in getting your case settled before a lawsuit is even necessary, you should get a discounted fee.</span></strong></p><p>The beneficiaries are Caruso clients.  Call 505-883-5000 for a free consultation with Mark Caruso and find out why his personal injury and wrongful death law firm is so highly rated by clients and other attorneys.</p><h2>Mark Caruso is available NOW to discuss your personal injury or wrongful death case.</h2><h2 style="text-align: center;">Call  him today  at  505-883-5000</h2><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo.png"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-614" alt="photo" src="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo.png" width="140" height="105" /></noscript></a></p><p>Call Mark Caruso for a<strong> FREE CONSULTATION </strong>to discuss your case by telephone or in person.</p><p>Once you personally talk to Mark Caruso you will understand why you need his specialized skills in personal injury and wrongful death claims.</p><h3><strong>Your consultation is FREE, so you have absolutely nothing to lose–and everything to GAIN!</strong></h3>

Our final list includes companies across a range of different insur- ance fields, including homeowners and auto insurers, health insurers, life insurers, and disability insurers.</p><p>Allstate—The Worst Insurance Company in America</p><p>One company stood out above all others. Allstate’s con- certed efforts to put profits over policyholders has earned its place as the worst insurance company in America.</p><p>According to CEO Thomas Wilson, Allstate’s mission is clear: “our obligation is to earn a return for our share- holders.” Unfortunately, that dedication to shareholders has come at the expense of policyholders. The company that publicly touts its “good hands” approach privately instructs agents to employ a “boxing gloves” strategy against its own policyholders.1 In the words of former Allstate adjuster Jo Ann Katzman, “We were told to lie by our supervisors—it’s tough to look at people and know you’re lying.”</p><p>The Insurance Industry’s Wealth</p><p>• The insurance industry has so much excess cash it may spark a downturn in the industry. According to ana- lysts at Standards & Poor’s, U.S. insurers are sitting on too much capital, and will likely endure at least three years of negative performance as a result.2</p></div><div><ul><li>The U.S. insurance industry takes in over $1 trillion in premiums annually.3 It has $3.8 trillion in assets, more than the GDPs of all but two countries in the world (United States and Japan).4</li><li>Over the last 10 years, the property/casualty insurance industry has enjoyed average profits of over $30 billion a year. The life and health side of the insurance indus- try has averaged another $30 billion.5</li><li>The CEOs of the top 10 property/casualty firms earned an average $8.9 million in 2007.

And for the entire industry, the median insurance CEO’s cash compensa- tion still leads all industries at $1.6 million per year.6</p><p>Profits Over Policyholders</p><p>But some companies have discovered that they can make more money by simply paying out less. As a senior execu- tive at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), the group representing those who are supposed to oversee the industry, said, “The bot- tom line is that insurance companies make money when they don’t pay claims.”7</p><p>One example is Ethel Adams, a 60-year-old woman left in a coma and seriously injured after a multi-vehicle crash in Washington State. Her insurance company, Farmers,</p></div><div><p>decided the other driver had acted intentionally and denied her claim, contending that an intentional act is not an accident. Another example is Debra Potter, who for years sold Unum’s disability policies until she herself became disabled and had to stop working. All along, Potter thought she was helping people protect their future, but when her own time of need came, she was told her multiple sclerosis was “self reported” and her claim denied—by Unum, the very company whose poli- cies she had sold.</p><p>In cases like these, and countless others, the name of the game is deny, delay, defend—do anything, in fact, to avoid paying claims. For companies like Allstate, there are corporate training manuals explaining how to avoid pay- ments, portable fridges awarded to adjusters who deny the most claims, and pizza for parties to shred documents.</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>2</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 4"><div><div><p>1. Allstate</p><p>CEO: Thomas Wilson<br> 2007 compensation $10.7 million (predecessor Edward Liddy made $18.8 million in compensation and an additional $25.4 million in retirement benefits)</p><p>HQ: Northbrook, IL Profits: $4.6 billion (2007) Assets: $156.4 billion8</p><p>There is no greater poster child for insurance industry greed than Allstate. According to CEO Thomas Wilson, Allstate’s mission is clear: “our obligation is to earn a return for our shareholders.”9 Unfortunately, that dedi- cation to shareholders has come at a price. According to investigations and documents Allstate was forced to make public, the company systematically placed profits over its own policyholders. The company that publicly touts its “good hands” approach privately instructs agents to employ a hardball “boxing gloves” strategy against its own policyholders.10</p><p>Allstate’s confrontational attitude towards its own policy- holders was the brain child of consulting giant McKinsey & Co. in the mid-1990s. McKinsey was tasked with devel- oping a way to boost Allstate’s bottom line.11 McKinsey recommended Allstate focus on reducing the amount of money it paid in claims, whether or not they were valid. When it adopted these recommendations, Allstate made a deliberate decision to start putting profits over policy- holders.</p><p>The company essentially uses a combination of lowball offers and hardball litigation. When policyholders file a claim, they are often offered an unjustifiably low payment</p></div><div><p>for their injuries, generated by Allstate using secretive claim-evaluation software called Colossus. Those that accept the lowballed settlements are treated with “good hands” but may be left with less money than they need to cover medical bills and lost wages. Those that do not set- tle frequently get the “boxing gloves”: an aggressive litiga- tion strategy that aims to deny the claim at any cost. Former Allstate employees call it the “three Ds”: deny, delay, and defend. One particular powerpoint slide McKinsey prepared for Allstate featured an alligator and the caption “sit and wait”—emphasizing that delaying claims will increase the likelihood that the claimant gives up.12 According to former Allstate agent Shannon Kmatz, this would make claims “so expensive and so time- consuming that lawyers would start refusing to help clients.”13</p><p>Former Allstate adjusters say they were rewarded for keeping claims payments low, even if they had to deceive their customers. Adjusters who tried to deny fire claims by blaming arson were rewarded with portable fridges, according to former Allstate adjuster Jo Ann Katzman. “We were told to lie by our supervisors. It’s tough to look at people and know you’re lying.”14</p><p>Complaints filed against Allstate are greater than almost all of its major competitors, according to data col- lected by the NAIC.15 In Maryland, regulators imposed the largest fine in state history on Allstate for raising premi- ums and changing policies without notifying policyhold- ers. Allstate ultimately paid $18.6 million to Maryland consumers for the violations.16 In Texas earlier this year, Allstate agreed to pay more than $70 million after insur- ance regulators found the company had been overcharg- ing homeowners throughout the state.17</p><p>After Hurricane Katrina, the Louisiana Department of Insurance received more complaints against Allstate— 1,200—than any other insurance company, and nearly</p></div></div><div><div><p>3</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 5"><div><div><p>twice as many as the approximately 700 it received about State Farm—despite the fact that its rival had a bigger share of the homeowners market.18</p><p>Similarly, in 2003, a series of wildfires devastated Southern California, destroying over 2,000 homes near San Diego alone and killing 15 people. State insurance regulators received over 600 complaints about Allstate and other companies’ handling of claims.19</p><p>Allstate says the changes in claims resolution tactics were only about efficiency.20 However, the company’s for- mer CEO, Jerry Choate, admitted in 1997 that the compa- ny had reduced payments and increased profit, and said, “the leverage is really on the claims side. If you don’t win there, I don’t care what you do on the front end. You’re not going to win.”21</p><p>For four years, Allstate refused to give up copies of the McKinsey documents, even when ordered to do so repeat- edly by courts and state regulators. In court filings, the company described its refusal as “respectful civil disobedi- ence.”22 In Florida, regulators finally lost their patience after Allstate executives arrived at a hearing without docu- ments they had been subpoenaed to bring. Only after Allstate was suspended from writing new business did the company, in April 2008, finally agree to produce some 150,000 documents relating to its claim review practices.23 Still, some commentators believe many critical documents were missing.24</p><p>Allstate’s “boxing gloves” strategy boosted its bottom line. The amount Allstate paid out in claims dropped from 79 percent of its premium income in 1996 to just 58 percent ten years later.25 In auto claims, the payouts dropped from 63 percent to just 47 percent.26 Allstate saw $4.6 billion in profits in 2007, more than double the level of profits it experienced in the 1990s. In fact, the company is so awash in cash that it began buying back $15 billion worth of its own stock, despite the fact that the company was simultaneously threatening to reduce coverage of homeowners because of risk of weather-related losses.27</p><p>Despite its treatment of policyholders, Allstate’s recent corporate strategy has focused on identifying and retain- ing loyal customers, those who are more likely to stay with the company and not shop around. The target demo- graphic, as former Allstate CEO Edward Liddy said, is “lifetime value customers who buy more products and stay with us for a longer period of time. That’s Nirvana for an insurance company.”28</p></div><div><p>Loyalty only runs one way, however. While Allstate focuses on customers who will stick with it for the long haul, the company is systematically withdrawing from entire markets. Allstate or its affiliates have stopped writ- ing home insurance in Delaware, Connecticut, and California, as well as along the coasts of many states, including Maryland and Virginia.29</p><p>In Louisiana, Allstate has repeatedly tried to dump its policyholders. In 2007, the company tried to drop 5,000 customers just days after the expiration of an emergency rule preventing insurance companies from canceling cus- tomers hit by Katrina. Allstate dropped them for allegedly not showing intent to repair their properties. After an investigation by the Louisiana Insurance Department, Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon said, “[A]t best, it was a very ill-conceived and sloppy inspection program. At worst, they wanted off of those properties.”30 Allstate also used an apparent loophole in the law by offering its policyholders a “coverage enhancement” which the com- pany would later argue was a new policy, and thus exempt from non-renewal protection.31</p><p>In Florida, Allstate has dropped over 400,000 home- owners since 2004.32 The move has landed Allstate in trou- ble with regulators because the company appears to be keeping customers if they also have an auto insurance policy with Allstate. Florida law prohibits the sale of one type of insurance to a customer based on their purchase of another line of coverage.33 Allstate officials have acknowledged that most of the 95,000 customers non- renewed in 2005 and 2006 were homeowners-only cus- tomers. The company ran afoul of regulators in New York for the same reason, and was forced to discontinue the practice.34</p><p>In California, while other major homeowner insurers, including State Farm and Farmers, agreed to cut rates, Allstate demanded double-digit rate increases in what the former insurance commissioner described as an “exit strategy.” John Garamendi, now the Lieutenant Governor, said, “[T]hey’ve said they want to get out of the home- owners business in a market that is competitive, healthy and profitable.”35</p><p>Consumer advocates have also complained that Allstate put an ambiguous provision in homeowners’ policies that may have deceived some policyholders into thinking they had coverage for wind damage when they did not. So- called “anti-concurrent-causation” clauses state that wind</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>4</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 6"><div><div><p>and rain damage—damage covered under the policy—<br> is excluded if significant flood damage occurs as well. Therefore, those with policies covering wind and rain dam- age and “hurricane deductibles” still faced the prospect of learning, only after a catastrophic loss, that they had no</p></div><div><p>coverage.36 In 2007, then U.S. Senator Trent Lott sponsored legislation requiring insurers provide “plain English” sum- maries of what was and what was not covered in order to stop this kind of abuse. “They don’t want you to know what you really have covered,” said Lott.37</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>5</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 7"><div><div><p>2. Unum</p><p>CEO: Thomas Watjen<br> 2007 compensation $7.3 million</p><p>HQ: Chattanooga, TN Profits: $679 million (2007) Assets: $52.4 billion38</p><p>Unum, one of the nation’s leading disability insurers, has long had a reputation for unfairly denying and delaying claims. Unum’s claims-handling abuses have consistently been the subject of regulator and media investigations.</p><p>There is no better example of Unum’s treatment of poli- cyholders than the case of Debra Potter. Potter, a financial services worker, developed multiple sclerosis and filed a disability claim with her insurer Unum. Unum denied the claim and told Potter her conditions were “self-reported.” Potter’s physician responded with a series of memos testi- fying to her problems, saying “there is no basis to support that her complaints are anything other than legitimate.” Unum continued to deny the claim for three years, even after appeals from Potter’s employer, BB&T, and after the Social Security Administration had concluded she was totally disabled. Only when Potter hired an attorney did Unum eventually agree to pay the claim.39</p><p>What makes Potter’s case unique is the fact that she had spent years faithfully selling Unum disability policies as part of a financial services package. “People need safety nets, and that’s what I thought I was selling them,” Potter would later say. “But here I am with all my knowledge of insurance and I couldn’t make it work for me.”40</p><p>Unum has a history of denying and delaying claims. In 2003, then CEO Harold Chandler was forced out after much controversy over Unum’s claims-handling policies. Former employees have gone on record saying Unum</p></div><div><p>ordered them to deny claims in order to meet cost-savings goals.41 Internal memos would eventually come to light detailing the company’s plan to move from “a claims-pay- ment to a claim-management approach.” Company execu- tives wrote “[the] return on these claim improvement ini- tiatives is expected to be substantial… [A] 1% decrease in benefit cost…translates into approximately $6 million in annual savings.”42</p><p>Despite the controversy, Chandler left with $17 million in severance and pension benefits.</p><p>In 2005, Unum agreed to a settlement with insurance commissioners from 48 states over their claims-handling practices. Under the agreement, the company agreed to reopen more than 200,000 cases and pay $15 million.43</p><p>In California, where nearly one in every four claims for long-term care insurance was denied, the California Department of Insurance launched an investigation into Unum.44 The investigation concluded in 2005, and found widespread fraud by the company. According to the report, Unum systematically violated state insurance regulations and fraudulently denied or low-balled claims using phony medical reports, policy misrepresentations, and biased investigations.45 California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi described the insurer as an “outlaw company.”</p><p>Yet more recent cases show Unum up to their old tricks. In 2007, the company admitted it had only reviewed 10 percent of the cases eligible for reopening under the terms of legal settlements reached three years earlier. In one recent case, the company denied the claim of a 43-year-old man who had to have a quintuple bypass and several stents put in to expand his arteries. Despite doctors’ orders to stop working, Unum told him he was not disabled and could still work—a decision the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals would later describe as defying medical science.46</p></div></div><div><div><p>6</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 8"><div><div><p>Unum’s activities, and those of other notorious insur- ers such as Conseco, arose the suspicions of Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), who asked the Government</p></div><div><p>Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate, and also wrote to Unum CEO Thomas Watjen demanding answers regarding the company’s policies and practices.47</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>7</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 9"><div><div><p>3. AIG</p><p>CEO: Robert Willumstad (former CEO Martin J. Sullivan was fired in June 2008, and<br> is expected to receive as much as $68 million, despite leading AIG to record losses over his three-year tenure—2007 compensation $14.3 million)</p><p>HQ: New York, NY Profits: $6.2 billion (2007) Assets: $1.06 trillion48</p><p>The world’s biggest insurer, AIG has a long history of claims-handling abuses for both individuals and busi- ness clients. AIG executives have also come under fire for opportunisticly seeking price increases during catastrophes. Now the company has been labeled “the new Enron” because of charges of multi-billion dollar corporate fraud.</p><p>AIG has long had a reputation for claims-handling abus- es.49 Part of the reason for that reputation is AIG’s reliance on underwriting results. Nearly every other insurance company relies on the income it makes from investing its policyholders’ premiums. AIG has always focused on turning a profit on underwriting—in other words, taking in more money in premiums than it pays out in claims. To do that, the company has had to be extremely parsi- monious about the claims it pays. Former AIG claims supervisors have alleged in litigation that the company used all manner of tricks to deny or delay claims, includ- ing locking checks in a safe until claimants complained, delaying payment of attorney fees until they were a year old, disposing of important correspondence during rou- tine “pizza parties,” and routinely fighting claimants for years in court over mundane claims.50</p></div><div><p>In 1999, after discovering AIG was losing as much as $210 million on auto-warranty claims, CEO Greenberg installed a new team that began to systematically reject thousands of claims, even when its own claims-handling contractor recommended they be paid. Richard John, Jr., a vice-president at the contractor, would testified that the company used any excuse to deny a claim, including rul- ing that installing manufacturer-approved tires was a “modification” that invalidated the warranty.51</p><p>After an AIG-insured Safeway burned down in Richmond, Virginia, the supermarket was confronted with damage claims from nearby residents who had been affected by the fire. AIG denied the claims saying that the damage was caused not by fire but by smoke, which quali- fied as a form of air pollution and as such was not cov- ered. In fact, in a series of high profile cases, AIG or its subsidiaries fought claims on tenuous bases, building its reputation as one of the most aggressive claims fighters in the industry.52</p><p>In 2005, AIG was sanctioned by a federal judge in Indianapolis for attempting to unfairly block discovery in an environmental case. AIG’s lawyers went so far as to give instructions not to answer 539 times during one deposition of an AIG executive.53 In January 2008, AIG agreed to pay $12.5 million to several states after state insurance commis- sioners found that the company had conspired with other insurance brokers to submit fake bids in order to create an illusion of a competitive bidding process in commercial insurance markets. Businesses and local governments ended up paying artificially inflated insurance rates.54 Even other insurance companies got the treatment. In 2007, an AIG reinsurance unit was forced by an arbitrator to pay more than $440 million to five insurance companies who alleged the AIG unit tried to rescind their contract when<br> it was time to pay, and then continued to refuse payment even after several courts had ruled against rescission.55</p></div></div><div><div><p>8</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 10"><div><div><p>AIG is not alone in using strategies such as deny-delay- defend to enhance its bottom line at their customers’ expense. What sets AIG apart, however, is the way it has so callously sought to take advantage of its policyholders’ misfortunes.</p><p>In 1992, on the day Hurricane Andrew landed in Florida, AIG Executive Vice-President J.W. Greenberg, son of then-CEO Maurice Greenberg, sent a company-wide memo saying, “We have opportunities from this and everyone must probe with brokers and clients. Begin by calling your underwriters together and explaining the sig- nificance of the hurricane. This is an opportunity to get price increases now. We must be the first and it begins by establishing the psychology with our own people. Please get it moving today.”56</p><p>Similarly, the September 11th terrorist attacks were to most people a terrible tragedy. To Maurice Greenberg, the “opportunities for his 82-year-old company have never been greater.”57 In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, prices for insurance soared by what Greenberg described as “leaps and bounds.” “It’s a global opportunity,” the CEO said at the time. “It’s not just in the United States, but rates are rising throughout the world. So our business looks quite good going forward.”58 Greenberg also said of the increased awareness of the need for insurance that the attacks prompted, “AIG is well positioned—probably as well as it’s ever been in this marketplace.”59</p><p>AIG executives are unapologetic about their reputation for opportunism. “We’ve always been opportunistic. When we see opportunities, we will never change. At AIG it’s part of our culture.”60</p><p>AIG’s opportunism has also crossed the line into fraud. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), insurance fraud totals more than $40 billion and costs the average family as much as $700 per year. However, while the insurance industry only talks about fraud committed by its policyholders, what interests the FBI is the increase in corporate fraud by the insurance companies them- selves, leading the agency to establish it as one of its top investigative priorities.61 No company is a better example of this kind of fraud than AIG.</p></div><div><p>In 2006, AIG paid $1.6 billion to settle charges of a variety of financial shenanigans that had commentators describing AIG as “the new Enron.”62 Two years later, five insurance executives were found guilty of fraud.63</p><p>The fraud accusations were traced back to longtime CEO Maurice Greenberg, who was ousted from the com- pany he had led for 38 years.64 Greenberg was identified by prosecutors as an “unindicted co-conspirator,” and noti- fied that the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had already fined the company $126 million, was likely to pursue civil charges against him for two separate inci- dences of fraud.65 AIG was also fined millions of dollars by state insurance regulators, and faces charges that they bilked pension funds out of billions of dollars.66</p><p>But that was not the end of the AIG fraud saga. Greenberg, who once described civil justice attorneys as “terrorists,” launched an epic battle of lawsuits and coun- tersuits with his former company.67 Suddenly, the $1.6 bil- lion AIG paid to settle claims of fraud seemed to pale in comparison to the charges being exchanged between those who knew better than anyone the true extent of the fraud. AIG now claims Greenberg “misappropriated” $20 billion, and Greenberg in turn says AIG concealed $4 billion in losses.68</p><p>In 2006, AIG was implicated in the manipulation of local government bond issues. At least $7 billion worth of “phantom bonds,” which were intended to aid the poor and supply computers to inner city schools, have instead only benefited companies such as AIG. In one such “phan- tom bonds” case in Florida, an AIG unit conspired with other financial services firms to extract fees from a $220 million bond issue that was intended to promote afford- able housing for low income families. Unbeknownst to the local government agency involved, AIG’s deal meant the less money that actually went to affordable housing, the more money AIG and its fellow companies would make. AIG and its co-conspirators eventually took $12 million in fees. Not a penny went to the affordable housing. The deal also violated U.S. tax laws, which would eventually force AIG to settle with the IRS. AIG was involved in similar deals in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Tennessee.69</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>9</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 11"><div><div><p>4. State Farm</p><p>CEO: Edward B. Rust Jr.<br> 2007 compensation $11.7 million</p><p>HQ: Bloomington, IL Profits: $5.5 billion (2007) Assets: $181.4 billion70</p><p>As the biggest property casualty insurance company in America, State Farm has become notorious for its deny and delay tactics. In many cases, the company has gone to extreme lengths to avoid paying claims, including forging signatures on earthquake waivers after the dead- ly Northridge earthquake, and altering engineering reports regarding damage after Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>Hurricane Katrina showed State Farm at its worst. One of the deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005, near Buras, Louisiana. The storm killed nearly 1,600 people and caused $135 billion in damages.71</p><p>One of the legacies of the storm was the widespread dissatisfaction with the response of State Farm and other insurance companies. State Farm would later claim it had settled 99 percent of its cases, but regulators criticized the company for using misleading statistics.72 The company claimed that any house that had what they considered water damage did not constitute a claim in the first place.73 In fact, the Louisiana Department of Insurance reported that it was contacted by 9,000 consumers seeking help resolving disputes with their insurance companies.74</p><p>State Farm denied the claims of the Nguyen family of Mississippi, who lost their home in Hurricane Katrina. State Farm’s own engineers concluded that the damage was caused by wind and even cited eyewitnesses who saw another house picked up by the wind and thrown into the</p></div><div><p>Nguyens’ home. State Farm, however, hired another engi- neering firm to come to a different conclusion and then denied the claim, saying the damage was caused by flood- ing.75 State Farm also denied the claims of Dean Barras in Louisiana. Barras’s home was exposed to the elements for two weeks, but State Farm’s response was “the chimney was not built properly.”76</p><p>Bob Kochran, CEO of an engineering firm assessing Katrina damage for State Farm, said that he was asked to alter reports with which the company did not agree. In order to keep the State Farm contract, Kochran agreed to tell his engineers to “re-evaluate each of our assignments.” One of the engineers, Randy Down, responded in an email, “I have a serious concern about the ethics of this whole matter. I really question the ethics of someone who wants to fire us simply because our conclusions don’t match theirs.” State Farm’s attempt to unduly influence the engineers was exposed during litigation in Jackson, Mississippi.77</p><p>One such angry policyholder was United States Senator Trent Lott. Lott, who had long counted on insurance companies for support, became an industry critic after his beachfront house was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and his subsequent claim was denied by State Farm. Lott even- tually settled with State Farm, but went on to sponsor leg- islation requiring insurers to provide “plain English” sum- maries of what their policies did and did not cover. Hurricane Katrina had highlighted insurance company use of such things as anti-concurrent clauses, which led policyholders into believing they were covered from the risks of hurricanes, when in fact subsequent flooding might wipe out any chance of a claim being paid. “They don’t want you to know what you really have covered,” said Lott.78</p><p>In April 2007, State Farm agreed to re-evaluate more than 3,000 Hurricane Katrina claims, and within a few</p></div></div><div><div><p>10</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 12"><div><div><p>months had paid nearly $30 million in additional settle- ments.79 When a grand jury later issued subpoenas prob- ing new claims against State Farm, the company sued Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood. Hood decried the lawsuit, saying the company’s agreement to reopen claims had never been intended as “blanket immunity” from future probes.80</p><p>Like Allstate, State Farm used consulting giant McKinsey & Co. The McKinsey concept involves cutting spending on claims payments to boost profits. Agents steeped in the McKinsey way speak of the “three D’s”— deny the claim, delay the payment, and then do anything to defend against a lawsuit.</p><p>In 1994, the Northridge earthquake in California killed 57 people, injured 9,000, and caused an estimated $33.8 billion in damage. It was the costliest earthquake in U.S. history, and insurance companies such as State Farm did everything they could to avoid having to pay for it. After it hit, a State Farm employee testified that company officials forged signatures on earthquake waivers to avoid paying quake-related claims and then withheld evidence when the company was sued. State Farm and other insurers accused of mishandling Northridge claims were fined over $3 billion in penalties; however, State Farm never actually paid the fines. Instead, an insurance department whistle- blower would eventually reveal that the insurers donated $12 million to two non-profit foundations created by insurance commissioner Chuck Quackenbush in what amounted to little more than a bribe.81</p><p>In 1999, a series of powerful tornadoes killed 44 people in Oklahoma and caused $1.8 billion in damages. Homeowners brought a class-action suit against State Farm, alleging the company had tried to undervalue dam-</p></div><div><p>age to homes or claim damage was caused by other factors such as faulty construction. A jury eventually ruled that State Farm acted “recklessly” and “with malice” and disre- garded its duty to policyholders. The firm that State Farm used to allegedly undervalue damage was Haag Engineering—the same firm that would be accused of mishandling Katrina claims six years later.82</p><p>In 1999, despite Oklahoma tornado claims, State Farm earned $1.03 billion in profits after taxes.83 In 2005, despite Hurricane Katrina, State Farm turned a $3.24 bil- lion profit. The following year, without a major catastro- phe, profits increased to $5.32 billion, for which CEO Ed Rust received an 82 percent pay raise.84 In fact, since State Farm hired McKinsey, the company has seen profits more than double from its 1990s level to the $5.4 billion it made in 2007.</p><p>Following the same tactic as Allstate, State Farm has embarked upon a campaign of market withdrawals and non-renewals in the aftermath of Katrina. State Farm has stopped writing new homeowners policies in Mississippi and Florida, and in the latter state non-renewed a further 75,000 policyholders.85 Just as they did in the aftermath of Katrina, State Farm stopped writing new homeowner policies.86</p><p>While State Farm will do anything to fight a claim once it has been taken to court, the company has never been shy about using the courts to its own advantage, even when it has to first stack the deck. In the 2004 Illinois Supreme Court election, one justice—Lloyd Karmeier— received huge amounts from State Farm employees, lawyers, and groups to which the insurer belonged. Karmeier won the election and soon after cast a crucial vote reversing a $9 billion judgment against State Farm.87</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>11</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 13"><div><div><p>5. Conseco</p><p>CEO: C. James Prieur<br> 2007 compensation $2.6 million</p><p>HQ: Indianapolis, IN Profits: $179.9 million (2007) Assets: $33.5 billion88</p><p>Conseco sells long-term care policies, typically to the elderly. Unfortunately, Conseco uses the deteriorating health of its policyholders to its advantage because the company knows if it waits long enough to pay out claims, its customers will die.</p><p>Conseco’s customers are some of the most vulnerable members of the population. The company sells long-term care policies, typically to the elderly, as insurance that the policyholder will be taken care of at the end of his or her life. Unfortunately, Conseco uses the imminent deaths of its policyholders to its advantage by delaying or denying valid claims of those who can no longer care or advocate for themselves. Mary Beth Senkewicz, a former senior executive at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), summed up the tactics of the long-term care insurance industry quite succinctly: “The bottom line is that insurance companies make money when they don’t pay claims…They’ll do anything to avoid paying, because if they wait long enough, they know the policyholders will die.”89</p><p>Long-term care insurance policies are usually pur- chased by senior citizens as assurance that they will be able to afford to live in an assisted living center or nursing home when they are no longer capable of living on their own. Conseco and its subsidiaries, Bankers Life and Casualty and Penn Treaty American, sell such policies. However, many policyholders have not been satisfied with</p></div><div><p>the way their claims have been handled. Conseco, Bankers, and Penn Life have had numerous complaints filed with state regulators over long-term care insurance, particularly in regard to claims handling, price increases, and advertising methods.90</p><p>Despite all their efforts to retain money by refusing to pay valid claims, Conseco has fallen on hard times finan- cially. Throughout the 1990s, Conseco and its affiliates aggressively undercut their competitors and expanded their market share in the long-term care insurance mar- ket.91 Around the time company founder Stephen Hilbert left in 2000, the market tightened and executives realized they had been underestimating how long policyholders would live once they entered nursing homes. In 2002, the company fell $6.5 billion in debt and was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.92 Conseco sued Hilbert for more than $250 million over company-backed loans and debt. In 2004, a court ordered Hilbert to return $62.7 million plus interest to Conseco and allowed the company to fore- close upon his 25,000 square-foot mansion in Indiana.93 Hilbert and Conseco agreed to a confidential settlement in 2007 that allowed the former CEO to keep his house.94</p><p>Two other Conseco executives faced civil and criminal charges for their roles in an accounting fraud scheme that overstated the company’s earnings by hundreds of mil- lions of dollars. Former CFO Rollins S. Dick and former chief accounting officer James S. Adams admitted to filing misleading financial statements with regulators between March 1999 and April 2000. In 2006, an Indiana court ordered that Dick and Adams be prohibited from serving as a director or officer of a public company for five years and ordered them to pay civil penalties of $110,000 and $90,000, respectively.95</p><p>Former employees of Conseco and its subsidiaries have spoken out about the company’s claims-handling prac- tices. Former Bankers Life agent Betty Hobel said Conseco</p></div></div><div><div><p>12</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 14"><div><div><p>and Bankers Life “made it so hard to make a claim that people either died or gave up.”96 Another former Bankers Life employee, Robert Ragle said “[t]heir mentality is to keep every dollar they can.”97 In a 2006 deposition, Bankers Life claims adjuster Teresa Carbonel described how she was forbidden from calling physicians or nursing homes to request missing paperwork before denying claims. Another Conseco employee, Jose Torres, testified in a separate deposition that he was told to withhold pay- ment on claims until the policyholder submitted docu- ments not even required under the terms of the policy.98</p><p>In May 2008, NAIC announced it had brokered a set- tlement between Conseco and 39 states and the District of Columbia over a pattern of abuses in its long-term care business. As part of the agreement with state insurance commissioners, Conseco and its subsidiaries were fined</p></div><div><p>$2.3 million and ordered to pay $4 million in restitution to policyholders. The company also agreed to invest $26 million in its claims processing system. If it fails to improve its service, Conseco will be ordered to pay an additional $10 million in fines. In addition to meeting these monetary obligations, Conseco must review its han- dling of past claims and set up systems to insure that future claims are treated fairly and handled in a timely manner. The company must review and readjust 1,112 denied claims, notify an additional 18,000 policyholders regarding 49,000 claims that were partially denied or denied after an initial payment was made, revise its claim- handling procedures, and set up a toll-free call center for consumers who believe their claims were not handled in good faith.99</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>13</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 15"><div><div><p>6. WellPoint</p><p>CEO: Angela F Braly<br> 2007 compensation $9.1 million</p><p>HQ: Indianapolis, IN Profits: $3.2 billion (2007) Assets: $51.6 billion100</p><p>WellPoint has a long history of putting its bottom line ahead of the welfare of its policyholders and their health care providers. Investigations have shown that Wellpoint routinely cancels the policies of pregnant women and chronically ill patients.</p><p>Indianapolis-based Anthem and Thousand Oaks, and California-based WellPoint completed a $20.8 billion merger in late 2004, creating the nation’s largest health insurer, covering approximately 28 million people.101 The deal was widely criticized by consumers, doctors, pension managers, and state regulators, who feared the merger would create a monopoly that would both raise premiums and reduce payment on claims, in part to cover the cost of the massive severance packages offered to executives who brokered the deal.</p><p>California’s State Treasurer Philip Angelides and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, as well as offi- cials at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or CalPERS, criticized the deal for providing excessive compensation to executives. The terms of the merger included a payout of over $250 million to nearly a dozen executives at the company. Leonard Schaffer, WellPoint’s Chairman and CEO at the time, received the largest windfall of all: nearly $82 million in severance, an executive pension, and stock options.102</p><p>California is making an aggressive effort to force WellPoint to stop engaging in practices it believes are ille-</p></div><div><p>gal. In March 2007, the state’s Department of Managed Health Care fined Blue Cross of California and its parent company, WellPoint, $1 million after an investigation revealed that the insurer routinely canceled individual health policies of pregnant women and chronically ill patients. The practice, known as rescission, is illegal in California. In order to drop individual policies, which are usually purchased by consumers who cannot receive health insurance through their employers, the insurer must show that the policyholder lied about their medical history or preexisting conditions on the application. As part of the state’s investigation, regulators randomly selected 90 cases where the insurer had dropped the poli- cyholder. In every single one investigators found the insurer had violated state law.103</p><p>During the investigation, California regulators uncov- ered more than 1,200 violations of the law by the company in regard to unfair rescission and claims processing prac- tices. In December 2007, Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner announced his office was imposing a $12.6 million fine against Blue Shield, saying the company had “commit- ted serious violations that completely undermine the pub- lic trust in our healthcare delivery system.”104 Among these violations were improper rescissions, failure to pay claims on a timely basis, failure to provide required information when denying a claim, failure to pay interest on claims where required, and mishandling of member appeals.105</p><p>Despite a series of fines and reprimands from the state, Anthem did not change its claims-handling prac- tices. The continuation of rescission practices forced Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo to sue Anthem Blue Cross of California in April 2008, for fraud, viola- tion of state and federal insurance regulations, and viola- tion of truth-in-advertising laws. Anthem’s practice of canceling policies of sick patients prompted Delgadillo to claim that “[t]he company has engaged in an egregious</p></div></div><div><div><p>14</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 16"><div><div><p>scheme to not only delay or deny the payment of thou- sands of legitimate medical claims but also to jeopardize the health of more than 6,000 customers by retroactively canceling their health insurance when they needed it most.”106 He also alleged that “more than 500,000 con- sumers have been tricked into purchasing largely illusory healthcare coverage based upon the company’s false promise.”107 The city is seeking civil penalties of between $2,500 and $5,000 for each violation, which could add up to over $1 billion.</p><p>Other states have taken action against WellPoint and its subsidiaries over their claims-processing practices. In January 2008, Nevada Insurance Commissioner Alice A. Molasky-Arman announced a $1 million settlement with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield over systematic over- charging of policyholders.108 Similarly, Colorado’s Insurance Commissioner, Marcy Morrison, secured a $5.7 million refund for consumers of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance policies.109 In Kentucky, the Office of Insurance ordered Anthem Health Plans of Kentucky to refund $23.7 million to 81,000 seniors and disabled people over inaccurate Medicare claims payments.110</p></div><div><p>Physicians have their own set of grievances against the insurance behemoth. WellPoint was one of several health insurers sued by 800,000 doctors who claimed they were routinely denied full payment for care they provided to policyholders. In two lawsuits, the physicians argued that insurance companies manipulated computer programs to systematically underpay physicians for the treatments they provided.111</p><p>Physicians in California have encountered a new rea- son to be outraged by WellPoint. Blue Cross California has recently sent letters to physicians instructing them to inform the company of any pre-existing conditions they come across when evaluating patients. The letter demanded that “[a]ny condition not listed on the appli- cation that is discovered to be pre-existing should be reported to Blue Cross immediately.”112 The California Medical Association promptly forwarded the letter to state regulators complaining that the insurance company is “asking doctors to violate the sacred trust of patients to rat them out for medical information that patients would expect their doctors to handle with the utmost secrecy and confidentiality.”113</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>15</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 17"><div><div><p>7. Farmers</p><p>CEO: Paul N. Hopkins (Farmers Group Inc. US subsidiary of Zurich Financial Services. Zurich CEO James J. Schiro 2007 compensation $10.3 million)</p><p>HQ: Los Angeles, CA<br> Profits: Zurich Financial—$5.6 billion (2007) Assets: $387.7 billion114</p><p>Swiss-owned Farmers Insurance Group consistently ranks at or near the bottom of homeowner satisfaction surveys. Given its tactics towards its policyholders, that comes as no surprise. The company even created an incentive program that offered pizza parties to adjusters who met low payment goals.</p><p>Farmers Insurance Group consistently ranks among the worst insurance companies for customers of homeowners or auto insurance in satisfaction surveys from the likes of JD Powers and Consumer Reports.115 Nor is it just individ- uals who get the short end of the stick. U.S. businesses were victimized by Farmers’ parent company, Swiss giant Zurich Financial Services, which in the last few years has paid out nearly half a billion dollars to settle bid-rigging and price-fixing cases. According to regulators, “business- es shopping for commercial insurance were deceived into believing they were getting the best deals available. The whole anti-competitive scheme was an intentional smoke screen by several insurance players to artificially inflate premiums and pay improper commissions to those who brokered the deal.”116</p><p>No case is as illustrative of the Farmers attitude than that of Ethel Adams. The 60-year-old Washington State woman was involved in a multi-vehicle accident that put her in a coma for nine days, left her with devastating</p></div><div><p>injuries, and eventually confined her to a wheelchair. Incredibly, Farmers denied her claim, reasoning that the driver at fault had acted in a moment of intentional road rage, and thus the crash was not an accident. The compa- ny’s denial caused an outcry, and Farmers Los Angeles headquarters was flooded with calls and emails from angry policyholders threatening to boycott the company. Farmers only caved when the Washington State Insurance Commissioner threatened the company with legal action.117</p><p>Adams’ case is symptomatic of Farmers’ attitude towards its policyholders. Internal company documents and testimony from former employees reveal a company that systematically places profits over policyholders. An example is Farmers’ employee incentive program, “Quest for Gold.”118 The program offers token incentives, includ- ing $25 gift certificates and pizza parties, to adjusters who meet goals, such as low payments and the rates at which they are able to dissuade claimants from retaining an attorney.119 Employees’ performance reviews and pay raises are also determined by their ability to meet claim payment goals.120 Internal emails show one particular claims manag- er encouraging representatives to intentionally underpay valid claims, saying, “[a]s you know, we have been creeping up in settlements… Our [claims representatives] must resist the temptation of paying more just to move this type file. Teach them to say, ‘Sorry, no more,’ with a toothy grin and mean it.”121 The same email also indicated that claims representatives were financially rewarded for such behav- ior. The manager singled out an employee who consistent- ly low-balled claims, saying, “[i]f he keeps this up during 2002, we will pay him accordingly.”122</p><p>Such strategies have attracted the attention of state insurance industry regulators. In North Dakota, Farmers has been fined for “unfair practice in the business of insurance… and an unfair claim settlement practice,” for</p></div></div><div><div><p>16</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 18"><div><div><p>its use of employee incentive programs and for tying per- formance evaluations to arbitrary claims-handling goals.123 In Oklahoma, Farmers agreed to limit its use of the claims-evaluation software Colossus, the same soft- ware used by Allstate, after the company was found to have repeatedly failed to pay claims in full.124 The Texas Department of Insurance joined with the state’s attorney general in 2002 to file a lawsuit against Farmers over violations of state consumer protection laws, including deceptive, misleading, and unfairly discriminatory home- owners’ insurance practices.125 While the company would not admit wrongdoing, it did agree to reduce rates and issue refunds.126 However, Texas regulators were forced to take action against Farmers again just two years later, ordering the company “to cease and desist from charging excessive property rates for residential property insurance in violation of Texas law.”127</p><p>Farmers’ most high-profile run-in with state regulators occurred in California after the 1994 Northridge earth- quake, which killed 72 people, injured nearly 12,000, and caused over $12 billion in damages.128 Many of the home- owners were covered by Farmers. Despite paying out over $1.9 billion for 37,000 claims, the company was hit with a wave of bad faith lawsuits for failing to pay policyholders the full value of their homes.129 In one case, a Farmers’ subsidiary was sued for bad faith and fraud by a condo- minium homeowners association after the company refused to pay to rebuild the severely damaged building. The homeowners, who were mostly minorities, were helped in their case by the testimony of a former claims adjuster, Kermith Sonnier, who admitted that a supervisor told him to settle the claim for a target amount, despite never having seen the damage firsthand. In March 2000, over six years after the quake struck, a jury awarded the homeowners association $3.98 million in compensatory damages and was deliberating punitive damages when Farmers agreed to settle the case for $20 million. Sonnier,</p></div><div><p>who had been fired by Farmers, also successfully sued the company for compensatory and punitive damages.130</p><p>The reaction of California regulators was an example of the sometimes dubious relationship between the indus- try and those who are supposed to oversee it. California Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush issued a proposed order saying that the company mishandled claims and could potentially face $450 million in fines. However, instead of pursuing the investigation, Quackenbush offered Farmers a deal that would absolve the company of all liability if it donated $1 million to the California Insurance Education Project, a foundation cre- ated by Quackenbush. The company also contributed $10,000 to one of the commissioner’s political accounts.131 In addition, Quackenbush’s settlement required that Farmers survey all its policyholders to gauge satisfaction with the company’s handling of their claims.132 Incredibly, any policyholder who completed the Farmers survey automatically waived all rights to seek justice in court.133 Quackenbush resigned under the threat of impeachment two months after the settlement was made public.134</p><p>Immediately following the earthquake, the company implemented a program asking employees to help recoup some of the losses and adopted the slogan “Bring Back a Billion,” meaning that employees were expected to bring in a billion dollars for the surplus.135 Some of these employees even signed pledges agreeing to work toward this goal.</p><p>More recently, Farmers have found California regula- tors less easy to manipulate. In 2007, California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner found that some Farmers customers who filed claims later had their insurance non- renewed or experienced premium hikes just because they used their insurance for its intended purpose. Farmers agreed to refund policyholders $1.4 million and paid $2 million in administrative fines, although it did not admit any wrongdoing.136</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>17</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 19"><div><div><p>8. UnitedHealth</p><p>CEO: Stephen J Hemsley<br> 2007 compensation $13.2 million</p><p>HQ: Minnetonka, MN Profits: $4.7 billion (2007) Assets: $53.5 billion137</p><p>UnitedHealth is plagued by accusations that its greed has endangered patients. Physicians report that reim- bursement rates are so low and delayed by the company that patient health is compromised. Money that should have been spent on medical treatment for policyholders has instead gone to the company’s former CEO, who faced criminal and civil charges for backdating stock options. UnitedHealth has also used its association with AARP to jack up premiums on products aimed at sen- iors, even though they are no better than their cheaper counterparts.</p><p>William McGuire orchestrated UnitedHealth Group’s rapid growth to become the largest health insurance com- pany by premiums written in America.138 Along the way, he ensured that he would be well compensated for his efforts. When McGuire became CEO in 1990, he immedi- ately began to streamline the company by cutting back on coverage for treatment he deemed unnecessary and by bargaining with doctors to reduce payments.</p><p>UnitedHealth also became dominant in the burgeoning HMO market by investing in information technology and acquiring smaller companies.139 The company’s success under his leadership made it easy for McGuire to con- vince the board of directors to reward him for his per- formance. McGuire was allowed to choose when his stock options would be awarded, essentially allowing him to backdate his options to make it appear they were issued on days when stock prices were at their lowest.140</p></div><div><p>The Wall Street Journal conducted an analysis of McGuire’s stock option grants between 1994 and 2002 and concluded that the probability the options were ran- domly awarded on dates when stock prices were at their lowest would be about 1 in 200 million.141 An internal memo made public during litigation confirmed that on at least one occasion options were granted “with an advantageous price.”142 By backdating his options, McGuire was able amass $1.6 billion in options as UnitedHealth’s stock price rose from 30 cents per share in 1990 to $62.14 in December 2005.143 Given the incredi- ble performance of the stock, the board saw no reason to restrain McGuire.</p><p>Shareholders and the SEC did not share the board’s view of McGuire’s worth. The SEC opened an investiga- tion into UnitedHealth’s options granting process, which ultimately led to McGuire’s ouster as CEO in 2006. Additionally, McGuire agreed to give back $620 million in stock gains and retirement compensation in order to set- tle federal and shareholder claims.144 The settlement left McGuire with just $800 million in options and $530 mil- lion in compensation.145</p><p>During his tenure as CEO, McGuire was meticulous about expanding the company’s reach. One very profitable move was the decision to partner with AARP to sell insur- ance products. UnitedHealth Group understood the value of AARP’s image as a trusted advocate for senior citizens’ rights when it partnered with the non-profit organization in 1998 to market its insurance products. That year, the insurer won a 10-year contract to brand its supplemental Medicare insurance policies with the AARP name.146 The deal was lucrative for both sides. UnitedHealth received $4.5 billion in premiums from AARP-branded products in 2004, while the seniors’ organization pulled in $197 mil- lion in royalties and $23 million in investment income that same year.147</p></div></div><div><div><p>18</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 20"><div><div><p>Beginning in 2006, AARP licensed its name to three UnitedHealth Medicare prescription drug plans, covering 4.1 million people.148 UnitedHealth also sells two other prescription drug plans not branded by AARP, and the enrollment numbers show just how effective the AARP name is. UnitedHealth’s stand-alone plans cover only 600,000 people.149</p><p>While this partnership is advantageous for UnitedHealth, it laid AARP vulnerable to the charge of allowing financial gain to trump its members’ best inter- ests. The premiums charged by UnitedHealth’s AARP plans are often far higher than those charged by other companies. The AARP reputation gives seniors the false sense of value and quality, even though there is little dif- ference in services and the premiums are far higher.</p><p>In June 2007, UnitedHealth was forced to suspend marketing of its Medicare Advantage program after the federal government determined that the company was misrepresenting its products. Medicare audit reports found that UnitedHealth lacked an effective program to supervise its marketing representatives.150 The reports also found that the company failed to notify policyholders about changes in costs and benefits.</p><p>UnitedHealth has repeatedly been accused of focusing on profits at the expense of its policyholders and their health care providers. The Nebraska Insurance Department reported a spike in complaints against the insurance giant for wrongful denials of claims and for failing to reimburse claims in a timely manner. Other state regulators have said UnitedHealth has acted improp- erly in denying claims. In one case, the company denied a doctor’s request for an enclosed bed to protect a four- year-old with an abnormally small head. In another case,</p></div><div><p>the company rejected a request from a patient who lost 200 pounds after bariatric surgery and wanted to have flaps of excess skin removed to prevent infection.151</p><p>Physicians report that UnitedHealth’s reimbursement rates are so low and delayed that patient health is being compromised. Many physicians in South Carolina have stopped accepting UnitedHealth coverage and others are forcing patients to pay up front. South Carolina is the only state that does not have a “prompt pay law,” which requires insurers to pay claims within 90 days. Texas, which has a prompt pay law, has levied $4 million in fines against UnitedHealth for late payment.152 Regulators in Arizona fined the insurer $364,750 for illegally denying over 63,000 claims by doctors.153</p><p>New York regulators and health care providers have taken an aggressive stance against UnitedHealth practices they believe to be unfair. The state Department of Health prohibited UnitedHealthcare of New York from enrolling new members until it improved practices, such as adding more customer relations staff, responding to claims faster, and updating financial reports.154 The American Medical Association (AMA) and the Medical Society of the State of New York sued the insurer over its reimbursement rates.155</p><p>Perhaps the biggest hit to UnitedHealth will come from a lawsuit New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo intends to file over how the company determines what portion of a doctor or hospital bill to pay. Cuomo alleges that UnitedHealth has systematically been forcing patients to pay more than they should for visits to out-of-network doctors and hospitals by intentionally low-balling reim- bursement rates. A company called Ingenix calculates rates; however, this company is owned by UnitedHealth, which creates the potential for a conflict of interest.156</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>19</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 21"><div><div><p>9. Torchmark</p><p>CEO: Mark S. McAndrew<br> 2007 compensation $4.7 million</p><p>HQ: McKinney, Texas Profits: $527.5 million (2007) Assets: $15.2 billion157</p><p>Founded, by its own admission, as little more than a scam, Torchmark has preyed upon low-income Southerners for over 100 years. Torchmark is the hold- ing company for a variety of subsidiaries offering low cost burial insurance, cancer insurance, life insurance, and similar policies. The company has come under fire for a variety of transgressions, including charging minority policyholders more than whites.</p><p>According to its former CEO, Torchmark’s very origins are as a scam. Founded in 1900, the group’s purpose was to funnel money to its founders, according to former CEO Frank Samford. Then known as the Heralds of Liberty, it initially registered itself as a fraternal organization to cir- cumvent Alabama’s insurance laws. It was reorganized as a stock company in 1929 and absorbed several other insur- ance companies over the course of the century before adopting the name Torchmark for the holding company in 1982.158</p><p>Since then, Torchmark and its various subsidiaries have preyed upon low-income Americans all over the South. The various schemes and tactics it has engaged in, includ- ing race-based underwriting, refusing insurance to non- English speakers, and deliberate overcharging of premi- ums, have prompted frequent lawsuits from regulators and policyholders alike. Now Torchmark plans to expand into more states.159</p><p>In the 1990s, Torchmark subsidiary Liberty National Insurance was forced to pay several millions of dollars in</p></div><div><p>litigation alleging fraud in selling cancer insurance poli- cies. The company had marketed the policies in the 1980s promising lifetime benefits, yet changed the policies with- out telling their customers.160</p><p>Torchmark subsidiaries Globe Life and Accident Insurance and United American Insurance also came under fire for their marketing of individual health insur- ance policies. Some of the tactics that were highlighted included selling replacement policies that did not actually replace all of a person’s coverage. Company agents would convince policyholders that their current coverage would be discontinued at age 65, even when it was guaranteed for life, and then would offer new policies that were not worth as much. Another tactic involved offering “low- cost” policies at rates that quickly shot up. In one such case in 1989, a Greenville, Mississippi, man bought a poli- cy with an $86 a month “teaser rate.” Torchmark did not disclose that the rate would immediately go up. Within two years, the rate had more than doubled.161</p><p>For years Torchmark and its affiliates have been involved in litigation concerning race-based pricing, par- ticularly over “burial policies.” In the mid-1980s, half of all Alabamans who died had a burial policy from Torchmark. These burial policies were sold at a higher price to black policyholders. In 2000, a Florida court ordered the company to stop collecting premiums on the old burial policies because black policyholders had been charged more than white policyholders. Alabama regula- tors followed with an investigation.162 In 2006, Torchmark subsidiary Liberty National Life Insurance paid $6 mil- lion to resolve a 2,000 member class action lawsuit. According to the allegations, Liberty National agents would market these policies with premiums of less than $1 to attract low-income policyholders. However, black policyholders ended up paying 36 percent more than white policyholders.163</p></div></div><div><div><p>20</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 22"><div><div><p>In 2003, Torchmark affiliate United American Insurance settled charges that it had defrauded senior citi- zens in the sale of Medicare policies. A two-year investiga- tion in Minnesota concluded the company had misled hundreds of people into purchasing supplemental Medicare insurance policies. According to the report, United American aggressively pressured hundreds of sen- iors into buying insurance that was more expensive and less comprehensive than the insurance they already had, which was a violation of state law. Internal documents showed that company agents were encouraged to act as if they were representing federal agencies or senior service centers. United American used a subsidiary, Consumer Support Services, which sent mass mailings to elderly citi- zens signed from the “Medicare Supplement Division.” Agents would then set up meetings to offer information packets, which in reality were home-sales opportunities. The fraud was reported by United American’s own employees. The company also deliberately delayed premi- um refunds and lied to authorities about its reserves. The Minnesota Commerce Department Commissioner said of the case, “This is not a case of rogue agents. These are not technical violations. This is irresponsible corporate cul- ture at work.”164 A subsequent report from the state Office of the Legislative Auditor criticized the settlement because it had allowed United American several improper conces- sions. Among these were a confidentiality provision that kept the deal secret, an agreement not to report the com- pany to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and an agreement to characterize the company’s payment as a “fee reimbursement,” not a penalty or fine.165 It was at least the third time United</p></div><div><p>American had been found to have broken Minnesota insurance laws. At the time, ten states had issued at least 26 enforcement actions against the company.166</p><p>Even Torchmark’s own employees are not immune from the company’s desire to put profits over people. In 1998, Liberty National incurred a multimillion dollar verdict for age discrimination claims put forward by its employees. Evidence presented at the trial highlighted one particularly aggressive manager, Andy King.167 Ironically, in 2006, Torchmark CEO Mark McAndrew brought in Andy King to shake up Liberty National’s employees. Newly installed as President and Chief Marketing Officer of Liberty National, King would oversee what McAndrew described as a move from “socialistic” compensation to a “capitalistic” approach.168 McAndrew went on, “There is no doubt mov- ing Andy out there we will see an improvement in the recruiting and new agent hiring. As far as these people that are at extremely low production level, this has been a long term problem. It is something that has gone on for years, so it’s not anything new. Some of those are veteran agents. Most of those would be more veteran agents. It has been accepted for a number of years, and it is something we’re changing. So it’s really not a new problem.”</p><p>Torchmark got a taste of its own medicine in 2003 when Waddell and Reed, a unit that Torchmark itself had spun off in 1998, conspired to switch policyholders from United Investors Life, another Torchmark subsidiary, to rival Nationwide. When United Investors sued, Waddell and Reed filed a civil racketeering claim against Torchmark accusing its former parent of scheming to continue its hold over Waddell after it was spun off. Torchmark eventually prevailed.169</p></div></div><div><div><p>The Ten Worst Insurance Companies in America</p></div></div><div><div><p>21</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 23"><div><div><p>10. Liberty Mutual</p><p>CEO: Edmund F. (Ted) Kelly<br> 2005 compensation $27 million</p><p>HQ: Boston, MA Profits: $1.5 billion (2007) Assets: $94.7 billion170</p><p>Like Allstate and State Farm, Liberty Mutual hired con- sulting giant McKinsey & Co. and adopted deny, delay, and defend tactics. The company has also gone one fur- ther than simple claims-handling abuses by indulging in what regulators allege is systematic bid-rigging.</p><p>Like Allstate and State Farm before it, Liberty Mutual hired consulting giant McKinsey & Co. to boost its bottom line. The McKinsey strategy relies on lowering the amounts paid in claims, no matter whether the claims were valid or not. By all accounts, Liberty Mutual has not become as notorious as its rivals for the deny, delay, and defend tactics that McKinsey encouraged. However, that has not stopped the company from leading the way in complaint rankings and stories of short-changed victims.171 In fact, Liberty Mutual is facing a glut of litigation from its own vendors who say the company’s cost-cutting has resulted in poor claims processing and a spike in lawsuits.172</p><p>Like several other big property casualty insurers, Liberty Mutual has also begun abandoning policyholders</p></div><div><p>across the country. The company has pulled out of many states—not only hurricane susceptible states such as Florida and Louisiana, but also northern states such as Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts, and much of New York. A 2007 New York Times article high- lighted Liberty Mutual policyholders James and Ann Gray of Long Island. The Grays were “nonrenewed” by Liberty Mutual despite the fact that they lived 12 miles from the coast and had “been touched by rampaging waters only once, when the upstairs bathroom overflowed.” In fact, Liberty Mutual and its big name competitors have left more than 3 million homeowners stranded over the last few years.173 New York regulators chastised Liberty Mutual for tying nonrenewals to whether a policyholder had an auto policy or other coverage, against state law.174</p><p>Liberty Mutual has also gone where even its big prop- erty casualty rivals Allstate and State Farm have feared to tread by trying its hand at massive corporate fraud. While the likes of AIG, Zurich, and ACE settled charges that they colluded with broker Marsh & McLennan in a huge bid- rigging fraud, Liberty Mutual remains the only insurance company that refuses to concede guilt. The fraud centered around fake bids that companies submitted to Marsh in order to garner artificially inflated rates. Liberty Mutual claims its business practices were lawful and that regula- tors’ settlement demands are “excessive.”175</p></div></div><div><div><p>22</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 24"><div><div><p>Conclusion</p><p>The insurance industry is in dire need of reform. For too many insurance companies, profits have clearly trumped fair dealing with policyholders. The industry has done all it can to maximize its profits and rid itself of claims. Allstate CEO Thomas Wilson outlined the strategy when he said the company had “begun to think and act more like a consumer products company.”176 Allstate has enjoyed a return double that of the S&P 500, but its policyholders have suffered cancellations, nonrenewals, and punishing loss-prevention techniques.177 Wilson has been unrepen- tant: “Our obligation is to earn a return for our share- holders.”178</p><p>Wilson is one of many insurance leaders who have lost sight of their legal and ethical responsibility to policy- holders. Now they answer only to Wall Street. The time is due for insurance reform that will level the playing field for consumers.</p><p>Three Pro-Consumer Insurance Reforms</p><p>1. Require Insurers to Work in Good Faith with Consumers</p><p>Many states have introduced, and some have passed, “Insurer Fair Conduct” bills which establish a private right of action by a first and/or third party against insur- ers for failure to act in good faith. Insurers must be held</p></div><div><p>to fair conduct standards when evaluating and settling claims.</p><p>2. Require Prior Approval of Rate Increases</p><p>Require insurers to obtain commissioner’s approval of proposed rate increases of 10 percent or greater, and authorize interested parties to intervene in rate proceed- ings. In most states, insurers can raise rates without the approval of the Insurance Commissioner. Rates are either automatically approved absent action on the part of the Commissioner, or the Commissioner has no authority to disapprove increases. The goal is to explicitly authorize— or even require—the Commissioner to hold a hearing prior to approval.</p><p>3. Establish an Insurance Consumer Advocate</p><p>States should ensure there is a consumer advocate either on the state’s Insurance Commission or within the office of the Insurance Commissioner. Some states have already done so. For example, in 1991, the West Virginia legisla- ture created the Office of Consumer Advocacy, charged with representing consumers’ interests in health care issues. The Consumer Advocate is also authorized to rep- resent the public interest in matters coming before the Insurance Commission.</p></div></div><div><div><p>23</p></div></div></div><div title="Page 25"><div><div><p>Notes</p><ol><li>“In Tough Hands at Allstate,” BusinessWeek, May 1, 2006.</li><li>“Analysts: U.S. Insurers Sitting With Excess Capital Face RockyRoad,” Insurance Journal, June 5, 2008.</li><li>2006 premiums totaled $1,032,512,780,000: “Net Premiums Written, Property/Casualty and Life/Health,” Insurance Information Institute (III), http://www.iii.org/economics/national/premiums/.</li><li>“Insurers as Investors,” Insurance Information Institute, http://www.iii.org/economics/investors/intro/.</li><li>“Industry Financials and Outlook,” Insurance Information Institute (III), http://www.iii.org/media/industry/; “Life Insurance,” Insurance Information Institute (III), http://www.iii.org/media/facts/ statsbyissue/life/.</li><li>“CEOs Rake in Cash but not Stock,” National Underwriter, January 2, 2008.</li><li>Charles Duhigg, “Aged, Frail, and Denied Care by Their Insurers,” The New York Times, March 26, 2007, www.nytimes.com/2007/03/26/ business/26care.html?ex=117.</li><li>Fortune 500, CNNMoney.com; AP, “Allstate CEO Gets $10.7M in First Year,” CNBC, April 2, 2008, http://www.cnbc.com/id/23925420/ for/cnbc.</li><li>Spencer Hsu, “Insurers Retreat from Coasts,” Washington Post, April 30, 2006, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/ article/2006/04/29/AR2006042901364.html.<ol start="10"><li>“In Tough Hands at Allstate,” BusinessWeek, May 1, 2006.</li><li>There is no better analysis of the McKinsey documents than the book, “From ‘Good Hands’ to Boxing Gloves,” by David Berardinelli, Michael Freeman, and Aaron DeShaw.</li><li>David Dietz and Darrell Preston, “The Insurance Hoax,” Bloomberg News, September 2007.</li><li>Drew Griffin and Kathleen Johnston, “Auto Insurers Play Hardball in Minor-Crash Claims,” CNN, February 9, 2007.</li><li>David Dietz and Darrell Preston, “The Insurance Hoax,” Bloomberg News, September 2007.</li><li>“The Good Hands Company Or A Leader in Anti-Consumer Practices?” Consumer Federation of America, July 18, 2007.</li><li>“Insurance Commissioner Tyler Fines Allstate $750,000 for Non- Compliant Consumer Notices,” Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) Press Release, December 20, 2007.</li></ol></li></ol></div><div><ol start="17"><li>“Texas Reaches Agreement with Allstate Regarding Homeowners Insurance Reductions and Refunds,” Texas Department of Insurance Press Release, May 12, 2008.</li><li>Michelle Kupra, “Allstate Sponsorships Raise Local Ire,” New Orleans Times-Picayune, January 6, 2008.</li><li>“Home Insurers’ Secret Tactics Cheat Fire Victims, Hike Profits,” Bloomberg.com, August 3, 2007.</li><li>David Dietz and Darrell Preston, “The Insurance Hoax,” Bloomberg News, September 2007.</li><li>David Dietz and Darrell Preston, “The Insurance Hoax,” Bloomberg News, September 2007.</li><li>“In Tough Hands at Allstate,” BusinessWeek, May 1, 2006.</li><li>“Duel in the Sun,” Best’s Review, March 2008.</li><li>Rebecca Mowbray, “Allstate Postings Don’t Include Catastrophe Claim Information,” New Orleans Times-Picayune, April 11, 2008.</li><li>David Dietz and Darrell Preston, “The Insurance Hoax,” Bloomberg News, September 2007.</li><li>“In Tough Hands at Allstate,” BusinessWeek, May 1, 2006.</li><li>“Allstate’s Smart Policies,” Barron’s Online, December 10, 2007.</li><li>Partial Transcript of Presentation to Edward M.

TITLE: 2013 Poll: Worst Insurance Companies To Handle Your New Mexico Car Accident Claim
DATE: 04/19/2013 12:00:00 00:00:00

BODY:
<h3>If you have a New Mexico personal injury claim against Fred Loya Insurance, Nevada General Insurance, Allstate Insurance or Geico Insurance, you may have a tough time dealing with the claims adjuster according to a recent 2013 informal poll of New Mexico attorneys.</h3><p>These insurance companies and their claims adjusters rank the highest among all insurance companies in New Mexico in complaints to attorneys about the handling of  car accident claims involving property damage and personal injury.</p><p>According to Albuquerque personal injury attorney Mark Caruso the poor attitudes of  insurance claims adjusters employed by these four companies cause clients to contact Caruso Law Offices and other New Mexico personal injury law firms for help. Clients are frustrated when the claims adjuster won’t   pay for all the repairs to their car or give them a rental car.  What irritates clients the most is when a claims adjuster challenges the client’s complaint of pain or injury or tells the client to just take a Tylenol and get some rest.</p><h3>One reason why these four insurance companies may be so difficult to deal with is because the personal injury claims adjusters for these four insurance companies are based outside of New Mexico.</h3><p>Fred Loya, which according to Mark Caruso is the worst of the bunch, is based in Texas and only recently began selling automobile insurance in New Mexico.</p><p>Their claims adjusters are Texans, and they just don’t have enough years of experience evaluating the dollar value of cases in New Mexico. Most personal injury attorneys will agree that cases are evaluated differently in Texas than in New Mexico.</p><p>There have been many instances where Mark Caruso has had to “educate” these out of state claims adjusters about New Mexico law and the valuation of injuries in New Mexico.  <strong>As a former insurance company attorney, Caruso has insight as to how these adjusters should evaluate cases and the process that they use in reaching a settlement value.</strong></p><p>Under our state’s law New Mexicans are entitled to have their vehicle repaired to pre-accident status or be paid the market value of the vehicle if it is totaled. They are entitled to payment for the loss of use of their vehicle during its unavailability. New Mexicans are also entitled to  money from the insurance company for medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost earnings and permanent injuries resulting from the collision.</p><h3>Caruso advises people with property damage and personal injury claims against Fred Loya Insurance, Nevada General Insurance, Allstate Insurance and Geico Insurance to immediately contact a personal injury attorney for a free consultation.</h3><p>Claims adjusters have no special duty to you to point you in the right direction.  Instead, their job is to settle claims as cheaply as possible so that they may be rewarded in bonuses and a pat on the back by their claims supervisor.</p><p>A personal injury attorney will point you in the right direction, even if all you do is have a free consultation. A personal injury attorney’s loyalty is to you–no one else.   Mark Caruso will give you a free consultation to discuss your claims against these four insurance companies. He will also give you some additional insight that can’t be published in this public blog. Call Mark Caruso at (505) 883-5000 for a telephone or in office appointment. We have 2 offices in Albuquerque to serve you–the Northeast Heights (Montgomery and Carlisle) or the Westside (I-40 at Coors).  We handle cases statewide and make home visits, hospital visits and after hours appointments.</p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fred_Loya_Logo.jpg"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-708" style="width: 236px; height: 120px;" src="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fred_Loya_Logo-300x84.jpg" alt="Fred_Loya_Logo" width="236" height="124" /></noscript></a><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/7a10fde3f645a9b549c0075ecf8c7278.jpg"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-710" style="width: 156px; height: 118px;" src="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/7a10fde3f645a9b549c0075ecf8c7278.jpg" alt="7a10fde3f645a9b549c0075ecf8c7278" width="156" height="114" /></noscript></a><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/216056_10151199997010329_195199215_a.jpg"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-709" style="width: 160px; height: 129px;" src="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/216056_10151199997010329_195199215_a.jpg" alt="216056_10151199997010329_195199215_a" width="160" height="146" /></noscript></a><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/imagesCA6QEWYJ.jpg"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-711" style="width: 252px; height: 108px;" src="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/imagesCA6QEWYJ-300x108.jpg" alt="imagesCA6QEWYJ" width="267" height="108" /></noscript></a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

TITLE: Medical Care and Expenses From Your New Mexico Car Accident

BODY:
<p>If you are involved in an accident or collision that is not your fault, New Mexico law clearly states that you are entitled to be paid your  medical expenses from the at-fault driver or its insurance company. Since you didn’t cause the accident, it is reasonable for you to expect that they would pay for all of your medical expenses.  The question I am most oftern asked as an Albuquerque Personal Injury Attorney is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>“What types of medical care will be covered</em><em>?</em></span><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“</span>   </em> This is the topic of today’s blog by Mark Caruso, Personal Injury and Wrongful Death Attorney.</p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/r-AMBULANCE-large5701.jpg"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-618" style="width: 278px; height: 223px;" alt="r-AMBULANCE-large570" src="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/r-AMBULANCE-large5701-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" srcset="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/r-AMBULANCE-large5701-300x223.jpg 300w, https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/r-AMBULANCE-large5701.jpg 570w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></noscript></a></p><p>Let’s look at the actual law according to the New Mexico Statutes.  For this we turn to the NM Jury Instuctions 13-1804.  This is the law that the judge reads to the jury, and is the law that is applicable to before trial and during settlement as well.  The law states, You are entitled to “The reasonable expense of necessary medical care, treatment and services received and the present cash value of the reasonable expenses of medical care, treatment and services certain to be received in the future.” Also, 13-1802 states that the injury must have resulted from the negligence of the other person.  Taken together, and in layman’s terms, the law is this…<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are entitled to reasonable medical expenses you need as a result of the negligence of the other driver.</span></strong></p><p>Clearly transport by ambulance and ER care meet this criteria. But questions are always raised by insurance companies about follow up care with your primary care doctors, medications, physical therapy, chiropractice care, medical massage therapy and other medical care.  Note that the law does not limit the care to anything except two words…..(1) result and (2) reasonable.  The law doesn’t say that you don’t get reimbursed for chiropractic care or medical massage therapy or limit you in advance of the type of medical care from your accident.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Auto insurance company claims adjusters try to limit your medical care or scare you into believing that certain medical care will not be paid for</span>. </strong> These are interpretations, restrictions and limitations wrongly placed on NM law by greedy insurance companies trying to save money for their shareholders.  You shouldn’t let claims adjusters from State Farm, Farmers, Allstate, Geico, Progressive, USAA, Fred Loya, Travelers, Hartford, Nevada General and other insurance companies decide the medical care you should get.  They are not doctors, they are just claims adjusters! <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Only your doctor and health care providers should decide your medical care.</strong></span></p><p>In order to prove that the medical care from your wreck should be paid to you, you merely need to be able to show the following:</p><h2><strong>A</strong>.  <strong>You gave your doctor or health care provider an honest history or your prior medical condition and what happened in the wreck?</strong></h2><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>History of Prior Injuries</strong>:</span>    It is extremely important to tell your doctor about prior problems, symptoms and medical care to the part of the body that you are currently claiming was injured as a result of the wreck. Clearly, he cannot state that you suffered an injury from the current wreck unless he knows about prior problems.  Your doctor may be able to state that you aggravated your prior condition in the current wreck if your symptoms are now worse than before the wreck.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History of Current Wreck:</span>  </strong> It is also important to tell your doctor exactly how the wreck happened, the speed of impact, the location of the impact and the amount of damages to your vehicle, if known.  The doctor needs an accurate history of the wreck to determine whether you sustained a significant impact to cause the injuries you are now claiming were from this same wreck.</p><h2>B.  Your doctor or health care provider examined you.</h2><p>The doctor needs to perform an actual examination of your injuries.  The doctor will normally check your range of motion and areas of sensitivity and pain.  Make sure to report all of your symptoms to your doctor so that your doctor can examine each area of your body that is painful.</p><h2>C.  Your doctor performed diagnostic tests such as x-rays.</h2><p>Don’t be surprised if your doctor asks your permission to perform diagnostic tests such as x-rays to help the doctor determine the extent of injuries.  X-rays are important to determine broken bones but are also useful in determining the effects of a soft tissue injury on your spine.</p><p><a href="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ImageDeposit_dot_com_FREE_Hosting_BIG_UserID_59291_Image_number_0579D2B305.jpg"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-627" style="width: 238px; height: 207px;" alt="ImageDeposit_dot_com_FREE_Hosting_BIG_UserID_59291_Image_number_0579D2B305" src="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ImageDeposit_dot_com_FREE_Hosting_BIG_UserID_59291_Image_number_0579D2B305-300x278.jpg" width="238" height="222" srcset="https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ImageDeposit_dot_com_FREE_Hosting_BIG_UserID_59291_Image_number_0579D2B305-300x278.jpg 300w, https://carusolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ImageDeposit_dot_com_FREE_Hosting_BIG_UserID_59291_Image_number_0579D2B305.jpg 329w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" /></noscript></a></p><h2>D.  Your doctor reached a diagnosis that your injuries were a result of the accident.</h2><p>Once your doctor takes your history, completes your examination and reviews the diagnostic reports he/she will reach a diagnosis of your injuries.  The diagnosis will tell you the injury that you suffered and will also state the cause of the injury.  An example would be that you suffered a broken leg as a result of the wreck or that you suffered a whiplash as a result of the wreck.</p><h2>E.  Your doctor will recommend and prescribe treatment or medications for your injuries.</h2><p>Now that you have been told that your injuries are a result of the wreck, the doctor’s job is to try and fix those injuries.  Some doctors will give you drugs and send you home.  Better doctors will make a referral for physical therapy, chiropractic care and perhaps medical massage therapy.  At the conclusion of your care, the doctor will state that that care that has been provided is reasonable.  <strong>Usually, the doctor’s final report lays out all of the doctor’s findings about history, examination, diagnostic tests, diagnosis and treatment.</strong>  It is extremely important that you doctor create this final report, because you will need it for the insurance company and perhaps even for litigation.</p><p>Our firm asks the doctor to also state that the treatment was reasonable, necessary and customary.  This means that the treatment  was the type of treatment that would have been provided by other doctors of the same qualifications in the area for the same or similar price of other doctors in the area. It also means that the treatment was necessary to treat the injuries, not just optional treatment.</p><p>Often times, outside sources can be used to help prove that the injuries were reasonable and customary.  Our firm utilizes two such sources for chiropractic injuries and treatment.</p><p>The first is the <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Croft Guidelines</span></em></strong>.   These Guidelines have been accepted by the New Mexico Chiropractic Association as the guidelines for chiropractic care in our state.  The Guidlines permit a specific number of treatments over a specific duration of time based on the findings of degrees of injuries. As long as the treatment of the chiropractor falls within these Guidelines, the treatment is deemed reasonable. It is important that your chiropractor limit treatment to that which is permitted by the Guidelines, or the insurance company will use the Guidelines to argue that the care was excessive. You should only use chiropractors who are familiar with the Guidelines and agree to treat you in accordance with the Guidelines.</p><p>The second is the <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PMIC</span></strong>. </em>The PMIC is a national publication used by health care providers and insurance companies nationwide to determine the customary charges for a particular service or procedure.  Each individual service or procedure done by a health care provider is designated a code,  and each code is designated a customary price in the community. Compare your charges from your doctor with the average charged by other doctors to determine whether your doctor was charging a customary charge in the community. You will have problems getting the insurance compoany to pay or reimburse you for charges that exceed the customary charge in your community.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Under NM law you are entitled to reasonable medcial care to take care of your injuries from the collision.  In communicating with all health care providers you must be honest in reporting your history and when cooperating with your doctor for the examination, the diagnostic tests and treatment.  The doctor’s diagnosis will determine whether the insurance company will pay for these injuries  provided the health care providers complies with Guidelines established by the doctor’s profession and PMIC.</p><p>Caruso Law Offices exclusively handles personal injuries and wrongful death as a result of accidents, collisions and wrecks from autos, trucks, motorcycles, buses, bicycles and pedestrians.
