BODY:
An energetic and sweet married woman was on her way to a fitness center during her lunch hour from work when she was broadsided by a 18 wheel truck which had run a red light. While she broke many bones in her body the impact caused a traumatic and force fueled injury to her brain. This injury was particularly disturbing as she was able to talk and, at times, seemed normal. However, the brain injury made it so she was unable to remember conversations or be able to independently function to take care of herself or others. The settlement allowed her to obtain brain injury therapy that was cutting edge at the time and resulted in some improvement. Unfortunately she is still unable to take care of herself, however a Trust set up to care for her has provided equipment and housing modifications.

BODY:
This case involved nurses attempting to blame an OB for not attending to warning signs during a delivery. The OB indicated he was in the on call sleeping room the entire night and was never called in a timely manner. Lost in this senseless fight was the family of a little girl who was born brain damages for the failure of the nurses and the OB to act and deliver the child appropriately. After researching the records it was apparent the nurses had falsified the records to reflect calls to the OB they never made. Despite all this both Defendants pushed this case to the eve of trial before resolving the matter. The family has utilized the award to provide education, equipment, housing and nursing care to provide for their daughter who is now nearing her teenage years.

BODY:
This was a tragic case of a young, happily married woman who was nearing the end of her second pregnancy when she became ill with strep throat. She went to a local hospital and was admitted with a fever and other abnormalities in her vital signs. Lab work came back which confirmed she was infected however both the nurses and her physician allowed the results to sit on the hospital&#x2019;s fax machine unchecked. She eventually became even more sick and additional signs of this progression were ignored by the staff and her physician. Her infection forced her into labor where she died as she gave birth to her second child. While remaining one of our most tragic cases, the settlement allowed her two young children and husband to secure college education funds and attempt to rebuild their lives.

BODY:
A young boy was in the hospital for pain in his stomach. A radiology study was being done to determine the cause and possible surgery for it. Because of the pain his breathing was difficult and had to be continually monitored. During the study his family was with him and became concerned that he was not breathing correctly. Despite their protests the staff ignored them and proceeded with the study. He ultimately stopped breathing completely and suffered brain injury when they were not able to perform CPR in a timely manner because of the delay. Because of the workup and time spent investigating the case, we were able to settle this matter before filing the case. The settlement was used to set up a Trust for the child, enabling him to purchase special equipment and care to take care of his many needs due to his brain injury.

Upon waking up she was found to be permanently paralyzed from the waist level down confining her to a wheelchair. After this settlement she was able to attend an outstanding University which was well known for being handicapped accessible, and now lives in a specially designed home to accommodate and help with her paralysis.

This remains the largest verdict in Miami County history. Jill and Nathan Casto were nearing the end of their pregnancy with their second child when she began to experience a decrease in her baby&#x2019;s movements. This is a well known sign of a decrease in the oxygen levels to an unborn child. Jill, a very intelligent and caring mom, called her OB numerous times to address this issue. She also visited his office. Both Dr. Holland and his staff continually ignored Jill&#x2019;s complaints until she eventually gave birth to a dead baby boy several days later. An Autopsy confirmed the boy had his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, which was causing the lack of oxygen. If he had been properly cared for he would not have died and the family would have had their second child. Jill and Nathan have gone on to have another child.

This case was a tragedy but was fortunately settled before a lawsuit had to be filed. A young woman died after a short stay in the hospital due to an undiagnosed infection. She left behind a husband and two children they had together. Due to the settlement we were able to provide college and retirement funds for the boys and the surviving spouse, respectively. While the compensation doesn&#x2019;t begin to make up for the loss, it was put to good use to advance the family and provide them security for education and allow child care help as well.

This remains one of the most disturbing cases we&apos;ve ever handled. The client&#x2019;s were a happy and close knit family whose father had heart surgery. After surgery his wound became infected and was being treated with another operation. During the evening his wound began bleeding slowly but obvious signs were there. The nurse on staff that night was new and ignored the signs of bleeding. In addition, she later changed her records in an attempt to avoid liability. An expert in chart alterations was hired who caught her in this attempt. Despite the chart alteration and the obvious and gross negligence, the Defendant&#x2019;s fought and the case was not settled until years later and the week before trial.

Mr. Woodruff, a married man with numerous children, was admitted to LMH to have a procedure. While there he was placed on a ventilator after the procedure was completed. He began to show signs of a decrease in oxygen which was ignored by the nursing staff. In fact, they attempted to blame a physician for not responding to their alleged complaints. Eventually, because he was being deprived of oxygen, Mr. Woodruff became disorientated and he dislodged his breathing tube which caused him to go into arrest. This was also mismanaged and led to his eventual death. An Allen County Jury provided this award, which at the time was the largest verdict in the County&#x2019;s history.

BODY:
A 59 year old woman just completed successful heart transplant surgery and was set to be discharged home. She developed shortness of breath and an x-ray confirmed fluid had collected around one of her lungs. A simple procedure needed to be done to drain the fluid and allow her to breath easier. The x-ray was ordered in the early morning hours by a Resident and then not properly communicated to various Attending physicians who saw her later that same day. Both Attending physicians failed to appreciate the x-ray findings and her condition began to deteriorate. Unfortunately she suffered a respiratory arrest when the fluid was not drained which left her with brain damage. She was unable to care for herself independently and required attention by her children at all times. This matter was settled a few weeks before trial and allowed for a Trust to be set up to pay for home nursing care, medical equipment and home modifications for her to live safely.

Kentucky Gov.

In fact, since the beginning of this year alone, more than 400 people have been hospitalized due to overdoses.<br><br>Something clearly needs to be done as the state has the sixth-highest rate of prescription overdose deaths in the nation, but the law does not come without controversy.<br><br>A call to action was issued to doctors by the Kentucky Medical Association regarding provisions in the bill that could possibly lead to privacy infringements and excessive oversight of legitimate medical practices, not to mention any reluctance from doctors to provide pain medication to legitimate patients.<br><br>The Kentucky Medical Association issued a &#x201C;call to action&#x201D; for doctors to contact lawmakers and express concerns over several hallmark provisions in the bill, which critics say could infringe on privacy and lead to excessive oversight of legitimate medical practices.

This includes a large number of Americans who cannot afford health care, as well as a growing group of middle-class patients looking for deals on elective surgeries usually not covered by insurance.<br><br>But it is not just the lesser costs that are driving people across the border for various procedures; many patients find that the Mexican doctors are more attentive and accessible when it comes to asking questions before and after operations and checkups.<br><br>&quot;Here, many Mexicans talk with pride about the easy access they have to their doctors, sending them frequent text messages with questions and expecting calls back within minutes,&quot; writes Jennifer Medina. &quot;One oft-repeated anecdote illustrates a sign of more compassionate care: nurses will warm a patient&apos;s hand before sticking him with a needle.&quot; Read the complete details here:<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/health/mexicali-lures-american-tourists-with-medical-care.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnlx=1342022405-kjplKNYrteX02fpVj1Adcg">Mexicali Tour, From Tummy Tuck to Root Canal</a></strong><br><br>Steve Crandall, a top-rated medical malpractice attorney in Ohio and Kentucky, feels these practices show the desperate need for health care reform in the U.S.<br><br>&quot;The fact that an increasing number of Americans are leaving our country to obtain medical care elsewhere, including Mexico, is an indictment of how poorly the U.S. health care system operates,&quot; says Crandall. &quot;When Mexico&apos;s physicians are able to provide more affordable and equally safe care, an alarm in Washington D.C. should be going off.&quot;<br><br>If you have any questions regarding medical malpractice throughout Ohio and Kentucky,&#xA0;<strong>contact Steve Crandall.&#xA0;</strong>Steve is available to help answer your &#xA0;questions and guide you in determining your next steps.

<strong>Many men with early-stage prostate cancer would do just as well to choose no treatment at all, according to a new clinical trial highlighted in The New York Times.</strong><br><br>&#x201C;&#x2026;Prostate cancer detection and treatment efforts over the past 25 years, particularly in the United States, have been woefully misguided, rendering millions of men impotent, incontinent and saddled with fear about a disease that was unlikely ever to kill them in the first place,&#x201D; writes Tara Parker-Pope.<br><br>Fear over the second-biggest cancer killer in men (second only to lung cancer) leads many diagnosed patients to quick decisions that could alter their lives forever; there are about 100,000 to 120,000 prostatectomy surgeries performed in the U.S. alone each year.<br><br>Large studies like this are now showing that early detection makes little, if any, difference in whether a man dies from prostate cancer.

<strong>Misdiagnosis of an illness, failure to diagnose and delay of a diagnosis continue to be prevalent medical errors that could prove to be harmful or fatal to a patient. </strong><br><br><strong></strong>This was the case with 12-year-old Rory Staunton of New York.&#xA0;Two days after cutting his arm while playing basketball at his school gym, Rory&apos;s pediatrician&apos;s office sent him to the emergency room with symptoms of vomiting, fever and a pain in his leg, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times. </em>He was given fluids and sent home with instructions to take Tylenol, a simple case of dehydration and an upset stomach, the doctors concluded.<br><br>&quot;Partially camouflaged by ordinary childhood woes, Rory&apos;s condition was, in fact, already dire,&quot; writes Tom Dwyer. &quot;Bacteria had gotten into his blood, probably through the cut on his arm. He was sliding into a septic crisis, an avalanche of immune responses to infection from which he would not escape.&quot; Rory died in the intensive care unit three nights later.<br><br>Vital signs, recorded while the family was still at the hospital, suggested Rory could be seriously ill. Three hours after Rory and his family were sent home from the ER, abnormal lab results warning of a possibility of sepsis were reported.

Medicare estimates it spent $28.8 billion in improper payments in 2011, while Ohio ranked eighth in improper payments in the U.S. in 2010.<br><br>Patients are commonly charged twice for the same service, charged for services they did not need or even charged for services they did not receive, according to the report.<br><br>&quot;There&apos;s no check and balance system.

The nation&#x2019;s largest health insurers have been accused of manipulating out-of-network care pricing, and now they are conning patients into significantly increased costs for this very coverage, according to The New York Times.<br><br>Despite an agreement reached in 2009 to finance an objective database of doctor&#x2019;s fees that patients and insurers nationally could rely on, these insurers are rapidly shifting to a calculation method based on Medicare rates, reducing reimbursement substantially since Medicare tilts its payments toward primary care, while most people go out of network for specialists.<br><br>While insurance companies defend this shift, saying exorbitant doctors&#x2019; fees are largely to blame, millions of insured families will be more vulnerable to catastrophic medical bills, even while paying higher premiums, co-payments and deductibles.<br><br>Fair Health, a new database being sought for legislation in New York, collects billions of bills from insurers to calculate a usual fee for each medical procedure in a given locality and allows consumers to compare likely out-of pocket costs.<br><br>Sandy Praeger, chairwoman of the health insurance committee of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said consumers are being caught in the middle of a battle between insurers demanding discounts and doctors who resist by billing more than they expect to get paid. &#x201C;For some things, Medicare is really a poor payer,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;So if that&#x2019;s the benchmark, that just magnifies the problem.&#x201D;<br><br>Read the complete details here:<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/nyregion/health-insurers-switch-baseline-for-out-of-network-charges.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1">Insurers Alter Cost Formula, and Patients Pay More</a></strong><br><br>&#x201C;This is yet another example of the billion dollar insurance industry looking for more ways to collect ever rising premiums, pay less claims and maximize payments for out-of-network care being sought by patients,&#x201D; says Steve Crandall, a top rated medical malpractice attorney who has seen his fair share of patients being overcharged.<br><br>&#x201C;The insurance industry dictates whom the patients can see, what the doctors can charge and what premiums they can charge to do all this,&#x201D; says Crandall. &#x201C;How government has stood by and allowed this to happen is one of the biggest economic and social mistakes of our generation.&#x201D;<br><br>If you have any questions regarding medical malpractice throughout Ohio and Kentucky, <strong>contact Steve Crandall.</strong>

The Cleveland Plain Dealer is running a year-long examination of a system that affects every patient in America, usually causing undue stress and a myriad of questions: medical billing.<br><br>The centers for Medicare Medicaid Services announced there would be a one-year delay in implementing tens of thousands of new medical billing codes; these codes dictate how much is paid to medical providers and who pays it.<br><br>&#x201C;The world of billing problems is as vast as medicine itself,&#x201D; according to Sarah Jane Tribble of The Plain Dealer. &#x201C;Among the many frequent complaints are: patients being billed for the wrong treatment, receiving double billing for the same treatment, being charged for more than an insurance contract allows or getting a bill for unexpected costs, such as a &#x2018;facility fee.&#x2019;&#x201D;<br><br>No one seems to want to take the blame for these medical billing issues; insurance companies claim the wrong codes are plugged in by hospitals and doctors due to human error or intentionally to get more money, while the other side claims there are too many arguments over whether services should be paid.<br><br>It is clear, though, who is truly paying for the downfalls of this arcane system: consumers.<br><br>&#x201C;Medical bills are one of the major reasons bankruptcies are being filed in the five northern Ohio counties served by the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland,&#x201D; said staff lawyer Michael Attali.

Several hospitals across the country are adopting an apology program based on the assumption that saying &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x201D; would make patients less likely to sue, reducing the number of medical malpractice lawsuits, according to WBUR, Boston&#x2019;s NPR news station.<br><br>Gabriel Teninbaum, an associate professor at Suffolk University Law School in Massachusetts, a state where these programs are making a foothold, believes that these methods are used by hospitals solely to save themselves, not to offer any comfort to the patients in question.<br><br>&#x201C;My concern is that a patient, after suffering a terrible injury as a result of an accident, will confuse a communication they have with their doctor as being intended to heal, when in fact it&#x2019;s intended to keep them from pursuing money damages,&#x201D; said Teninbaum.<br><br>One of the main issues raised regarding this program is the fact that, on average, patients who receive apologies tend to receive less money than patients did before the program was put in place because patients can be manipulated into underestimating the realistic amount of money they will need to carry on after such an injury.<br><br>Teninbaum believes there is a scenario that could work for the mutual benefit of both the hospital and the patient; as long as the patient is instructed to seek legal counsel from the very outset, the outcome could be positive for all parties involved.<br><br>&#x201C;&#x2026;What you&#x2019;re providing the patient with is empowerment so that they can go out and get educated on what their rights are,&#x201D; Teninbaum said. &#x201C;And from there, there can be a fuller transparent conversation where everyone is on the same page about how to resolve the matter.&#x201D;<br><br>Read the complete article here:<br><br><a href="http://www.wbur.org/2012/05/01/medical-apologies">Law Professor: Medical Apology Programs Might Manipulate Patients</a><br><br>Steve Crandall, a top rated medical malpractice lawyer in Ohio and Kentucky, agrees that these apology programs are yet another way to protect the care provider at the expense of the patient.<br><br>Crandall believes laws that are purposely written to protect physicians&#x2019; apologies and admissions of mistakes need to be changed; if he or she admits they were negligent, then this information should be allowed be presented to the jury in a court of law.<br><br>&#x201C;There are no laws to prevent the physician from bringing up when a patient thanks them or sends a kind note even when the patient is not fully aware of the mistake that physician made,&#x201D; said Crandall. &#x201C;How is that fair?&#x201D;<br><br>Steve Crandall is available to help answer your medical malpractice questions and guide you in determining your next steps; for any questions, contact Steve Crandall.

There is only one word to describe the American healthcare system, according to Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society: failure.<br><br>In a recent interview with The New York Times, Dr. Brawley spoke out about the assertion that the U.S. has the best health care in the world: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a great place to be sick if you are poor and uninsured and want consistent, basic care.&#x201D;<br><br>Dr. Brawley does not believe that the usual suspects are the only ones to blame for the shortcomings of the &#x201C;irrational&#x201D; American system, though; he says many American patients, particularly the wealthy, are &#x201C;gluttonous&#x201D; in their unwise consumption of health care resources and hurting themselves with overtreatment.<br><br>He has seen both sides of the patient spectrum throughout his medical career, from a patient in the early stages of colon cancer who shopped around until finding a doctor that would administer unnecessary chemotherapy, to a woman so in denial about her breast cancer that she did not go to a doctor until her breast literally fell off.<br><br>&#x201C;I blame patients, I blame doctors, I blame hospitals, I blame drug companies, I blame insurance companies,&#x201D; Dr. Brawley said. &#x201C;Our health care system is messed up because the system is designed to fail, and everybody is responsible for health care failing as it is now.&#x201D; The full details of the interview can be found here:<br><br><strong><a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/how-doctors-and-patients-do-harm/">How Doctors and Patients Do Harm</a></strong><br><br>Steve Crandall, a top ranked medical malpractice attorney in Ohio and Kentucky, believes that rather than deciding whom to blame, the focus should be on finding solutions to this economic epidemic that is crushing everyone in its path.<br><br>&#x201C;While patients and physicians certainly have some responsibility, the main issue is the government&#x2019;s failure to hold billion dollar insurance companies responsible for their growing premium payments and lower payout for the care their insurance is supposed to provide,&#x201D; Crandall says.<br><br>Steve Crandall is available to help answer your medical malpractice questions and guide you in determining your next steps; for any questions, <strong>contact Steve Crandall.</strong>

People place their loved ones in nursing homes in order for them to receive proper care and medical attention, but what happens when these facilities are not closely monitored?<br><br>More than one in five U.S. nursing homes are administering anti-psychotic drugs to people who do not have a condition that warrants their use, according to a Boston Globe study reported in USA Today.<br><br>These drugs, received unnecessarily by about 185,000 nursing home residents nationally in 2010, have powerful side effects, especially for patients suffering from Alzheimer&#x2019;s or other dementia-related ailments. However, many nursing homes are prescribing these potentially dangerous drugs to avoid agitation and combative behavior.<br><br>&#x201C;We have an inordinate amount of prescriptions written for a population that is already frail, and we know these drugs increase the risk for side effects, including death,&#x201D; said Michael Gloth, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, specializing in seniors. &#x201C;So why are they being written?&#x201D;<br><br>Read the full details here:<br><br><strong><a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/04/report-antipsychotics-wrongly-prescribed-in-nursing-homes/1#.T6AR16uue6F">Report: Anti-psychotics wrongly prescribed in nursing homes</a></strong><br><br>&#x201C;Nursing home care is abysmal,&#x201D; says Steve Crandall, a top rated medical malpractice lawyer throughout Ohio and Kentucky, who believes the problem is only going to continue to get worse until something drastic is done.<br><br>This problem does not only affect the patients either, according to Crandall: &#x201C;While the patients are on the medication they are easier to care for and leave in their rooms.

More patients over the age of 65 are being considered for heart transplants, patients who would have been routinely rejected just ten years ago, according to The New York Times.<br><br>Thanks to voluntary guidelines issued by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation in 2006, hospitals are opening up their transplant candidacy to older people with otherwise overall good health, with some centers like the Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins Medicine operating on patients in their early or even middle 70s.<br><br>&#x201C;Many of these older patients can transition to an even older age while maintaining a very good quality of life. Why would we deny someone that opportunity?&#x201D; said Dr. Mandeep Mehra, executive director of the Center for Advanced Heart Disease at Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital in Boston and chairman of the committee that drew up the new guidelines.<br><br>Some transplant centers still do not want to risk such operations, though, even when statistics show insubstantial differences in survival rates based on age. There remains hearty debate that scarce organs should be allocated to young people, while seniors are placed on alternative lists to receive hearts from older donors that are not viable for younger patients.

Patients go to hospitals with the expectation to get better, not to be buried with exorbitant hospital bills for years to come. The latter, however, is becoming more and more of a reality; hospital charges are all over the map, according to a new study reported recently in the Archives of Internal Medicine.<br><br>The New York Times recently highlighted this story when an insured California man spent four days admitted in a hospital and was subsequently charged $59,283 &#x2013; for an appendectomy. This amount is six times the fair price for performing an appendectomy in Northern California, according to the Healthcare Blue Book, and the cases only get more extreme from there; one patient was charged a staggering $182,955 for the routine surgery, and patients were given similar discrepancies in prices for a number of other procedures.<br><br>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no rhyme or reason for how patients are charged or how hospitals come up with charges,&#x201D; said Dr. Renee Y. Hsia, the study&#x2019;s lead author and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of California. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no other industry where you get charged 100 times the same amount, or 121 times, for the same product.&#x201D;<br><br>Practical advice is offered to consumers for dealing with these out-of-control pricing practices that are not limited to the state of California, including: learning which hospitals are in their insurance network, obtaining an explanation of benefits regarding their insurance coverage and contacting the hospital and doctor for pricing estimates beforehand.

A man was in the hospital for injuries received at his home when an accident on his farm occured.   This accident would not have resulted in permanent injury but was serious enough to require a breathing tube until he improved.   His breathing tube was blocked by secretions and his vital signs worsened, however the nursing staff failed to appreciate the decrease in his condition.   Eventually he suffered a respiratory arrest which led to severe and permanent brain damage rendering him unable to care for himself.    The settlement will enable his care to be increased and may allow his family to purchase the equipment necessary to bring him home and to travel for additional therapies.

Every year, an estimated 4,000 cases of &quot;retained surgical items,&quot; or items left in the patient&apos;s body after surgery, are reported in the United States, according to&#xA0;<em>The New York Times</em>.<br><br>These items, which also include clamps, scalpels and scissors, &#xA0;are usually gauzelike sponges and are left largely due to human error based on the old-fashioned method of keeping manual count of the amount of sponges used,&#xA0;of which dozens are stuffed inside of a patient to control bleeding during a surgical procedure. The operating room declared all sponges accounted for in four out of five cases in which they were left inside a patient.<br><br>&quot;In most instances, the patient is completely helpless,&quot; said Dr. Verna C. Gibbs, the director of NoThing Left Behind, a national surgical patient safety project. &quot;We&apos;ve anesthetized them, we take away their ability to think, to breathe, and we cut them open and operate on them. There&#x2019;s no patient advocate standing over them saying, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t forget that sponge in them.&#x2019; I consider it a great affront that we still manage to leave our tools inside of people.&#x201D;<br><br>While hospitals now have access to more technological approaches to accounting for all sponges used during a procedure, including radio-frequency tags and bar code technology, many do not want to commit to the extra cost needed to implement these policies.<br><br>The extra cost to have each sponge implanted with a tiny radio-frequency tag that will alert a detector if left inside the patient before closing them up? About $10 - roughly the cost of a single suture used in surgery.

Advances in preventive medicine and public health have given patients plenty of proven recommendations to keep from getting sick, which may be difficult for a doctor to fully explain in the course of a 15-minute office visit, according to&#xA0;<em>The New York Times</em>.<br><br>While these recommendations can potentially prevent injuries and fatalities, doctors are finding there is not enough time in the day to get into detail about each topic with each patient. Some physicians may choose to focus on a select few topics per visit, while others may resort to giving patients typed lists to read at home instead.<br><br>&quot;But an increasing number of doctors, under mounting pressures from insurance companies and others to prove that they are delivering quality care, are simply scrambling to cover as many of the wellness recommendations as they can, piling on the dos and don&apos;ts...&apos;the grand information dump,&apos;&quot; writes Pauline W.

<strong>New York health officials are poised to make their state the first in the nation to require that hospitals aggressively look for sepsis in patients so treatment can begin sooner, according to&#xA0;The New York Times.</strong>

Sepsis, an abnormal and self-destructive immune response to infection or illness, often progresses from a high pulse rate and fever to severely low blood pressure, shock and organ failure.

With early warning signs that are difficult to tell apart from the flu or cold, clinicians routinely do not suspect this leading cause of death in hospitals until it is too late.

&quot;It&apos;s the most common killer in intensive care units,&quot; said Dr. Mitchell M. Levy, a professor at Brown University School of Medicine. &quot;It kills more people than breast cancer, lung cancer and stroke combined.&quot;

If physicians and nurses were trained to watch for sepsis, as they now routinely do for heart attacks, the response can be handled before it gets out of control.&#xA0;If started early enough, the treatment, which includes antibiotics and fluids, can reduce the &quot;relative risk mortality [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][of sepsis] by 40 percent.&quot; Read the full details here:

Steve Crandall, a top-rated medical malpractice attorney throughout Ohio and Kentucky, believes major change is needed to prevent the thousands that needlessly die from sepsis each year.

&quot;Many physicians ignore well known signs, symptoms and lab values which warn of sepsis during a time when it can be treated,&quot; said Crandall.

<div><strong>Nearly four months after Daniel Hughes, an 18-year old chemical engineering student at Ohio State, was hit and run over by a construction truck on campus September 5, no police report has been released.</strong>As Hughes tries to cope with a bone infection and the loss of roughly one-third of his body, including his right leg and hip, many details of the case remain unknown to him and his family.

OSU Police promised Steve Crandall, Daniel&apos;s attorney, a police report the week of October 8, and again in November. According to Ohio Revised Code, a traffic crash report, typically a three-to-four-page document that tells what happened and who is involved, should be made available within five days of the incident

&quot;It&apos;s frustrating to Daniel and his entire family that there&apos;s still no report or time frame for when the report will be released,&quot; Crandall said. &quot;What is delaying that report, or even a portion of the report so that we can interview witnesses? I&apos;ve been asking those questions but have found silence on those topics.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>Consolidation in health care is creating a tightening bind for independent doctors across the country, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

Reduced Medicare reimbursements and higher technology costs are just some reasons why the percentage of independent doctors nationwide has dropped from 57 percent to 39 percent since 2000, according to estimates by Accenture, a consulting firm. Hospitals, private equity firms and health insurance companies are also acquiring physician practices at a rapid rate.

Doctors who have sold their practices and become employees of large hospitals describe growing pressure by the hospitals that dictate which tests and procedures to perform, how much to charge and which patients to admit. Unnecessary tests and procedures are largely performed and patients who do not need a hospital stay are admitted just to meet the hospital&apos;s financial goals.

&quot;We&apos;re seeing a lot more consolidation that we did 10 years ago,&quot; said Jeffrey Perry, an assistant director in the Federal Trade Commission&apos;s Bureau of Competition. &quot;Historically, what we&apos;ve seen with the consolidation in the health care industry is that prices go up, but quality does not improve.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/business/a-hospital-war-reflects-a-tightening-bind-for-doctors-nationwide.html?ref=health&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">A Hospital War Reflects a Bind for Doctors in the U.S.&#xA0;</a></strong>

<strong>&#xA0;</strong>&quot;This is another disturbing example of hospitals placing profits in front of the concern for the patients they treat,&quot; said Steve Crandall, a top-rated medical malpractice attorney throughout Ohio and Kentucky. &quot;Many patients are injured at hospitals they should not have been admitted to or by tests that should not have been ordered.&quot;

<img class="alignright wp-image-6102 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/informed-consent-150x150.jpg" alt="The 7 Top Causes of Medical Malpractice Claims" width="150" height="150">

The&#xA0;negligence of a doctors, nurses, hospitals, and other medical professionals and facilities contribute to hundreds of thousands of deaths per year in the U.S. alone &#x2013;&#xAD; about 440,000, to be exact. While some mistakes are inevitable, and not all mistakes are grounds for a claim of negligence, there are some errors that occur over and over again, contributing to the high number of preventable deaths each year.

According to Dr. RJ Roberts of the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.med.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Wisconsin Medical School</a>, these are the 7 top causes of medical malpractice claims in the country:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Failure to Obtain Informed Consent &#x2013;</strong>&#xA0;Medical errors are caused when a patient is not fully informed of expected outcomes, potential risks and reasonable alternatives to the recommended course of action by the doctor, which can result in damages to the patient.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancer Misdiagnosis or Failure to Diagnose or a Delay in Diagnosis</strong>&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;Approximately <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/mammograms/limitations-of-mammograms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20% of screening mammograms</a> return false negative results in breast cancer patients. Doctors who do not follow up appropriately on false negative studies for this and other types of cancer may cause harm to the patient.</li>
    <li><strong>Negligent Procedures or Surgical Errors</strong>&#xA0;&#x2013; Years of medical school and procedural training cannot account for a doctor who is physically exhausted or mentally distracted. Sleep deprivation or stress may result in severe patient complications.</li>
    <li><strong>Wrong Diagnosis and Negligent Misdiagnosis of Fracture or Trauma</strong>&#xA0;&#x2013; Doctors who assume an illness or fracture is minor without following up with additional x-rays or diagnostic tests are liable for medical malpractice claims. Dependent on the location of the fracture, the failure to follow through can have severe consequences, including loss of a limb.</li>
    <li><strong>Delay in Diagnosis or Failure to Consult in a Timely Manner</strong>&#xA0;&#x2013; A hesitation to make a referral, whether it be to a specialist or a course of treatment, can result in adverse repercussions suffered by the patient as a result.</li>
    <li><strong>Medication Errors or Medication Malpractice Resulting from Negligent Drug Treatment</strong>&#xA0;&#x2013; It is estimated that one million medication mistakes happen each year &#x2013; about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leahbinder/2013/09/03/the-shocking-truth-about-medication-errors/#294ed02e10ab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one mistake every day for every patient</a>. Prescription drug malpractice claims can also result from a doctor&#x2019;s poor handwriting on the prescription order and misinterpretation by a pharmacist.</li>
    <li><strong>Birth Injury Malpractice or Negligent Maternity Care Practice</strong>&#xA0;&#x2013;&#xA0;The two most common birth defect or birth injury medical malpractice claims arise from excessive use of oxytocin, specifically if the baby is experiencing distress, and the doctor&#x2019;s failure to ensure their patient is covered by another physician informed about the patient&#x2019;s clinical history should the primary doctor be unavailable.</li>
</ol>
There are many reasons for the increasing cases of medical malpractice in the United States. If you or your family have questions about medical errors that should not have occurred and are not fully explained by the care providers, safety would require you to&#xA0;investigate the matter with an attorney&#xA0;who specialized in medical malpractice.
<h2>How common is medical malpractice?</h2>
According to the Journal of the <a href="http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2016/03/pfor6-1603.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Medical Association</a> (JAMA), medical negligence is the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-05-03/medical-errors-are-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third leading cause of death in the U.S.</a> - right behind heart disease and cancer.&#xA0;In 2012, over $3 billion was spent in medical malpractice payouts, averaging one payout every 43 minutes.

<div><br><br><strong>About 77,000 accidents caused by the direct fault of a commercial truck driver occur each year, according to a report by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).</strong><br><br>It is important to be alert at all times on the road as these accidents are caused by a variety of different factors:<br><ol><br>    <li><strong>Prescription Drug Use</strong> - 26% of truck accidents are caused by prescription drug use even though the &quot;FMCSA has some additional rules that prohibit the use of legally prescribed controlled substances (such as barbiturates, amphetamines, morphine, etc.) by safety-sensitive drivers involved in interstate commerce.&quot;</li><br>    <li><strong>Traveling Too Fast</strong> - 23% of truck accidents are caused by a direct violation of FMCSA&apos;s regulation 392.6, which states &quot;No motor carrier shall schedule a run nor permit nor require the operation of any commercial motor vehicle between points in such period of time as would necessitate the commercial motor vehicle being operated at speeds greater than those prescribed by the jurisdictions in or through which the commercial motor vehicle is being operated.&quot;</li><br> <li><strong>Unfamiliar with Roadway</strong> - 22% of truck accidents are due to drivers reading a map or directions during travel. The FMCSA posts helpful tips to follow&#xA0;<em>before</em> driving to prevent these very accidents.</li><br> <li><strong>Over-the-Counter Drug Use</strong> - Even something as seemingly harmless as cough medicine can be very dangerous while operating a 80,000 pound machine; 18% of truck accidents are caused by over-the-counter medications.</li><br> <li><strong>Inadequate Surveillance</strong> - 14% of all truck accidents are caused by truck drivers not being adequately aware of their surroundings. Over 1/3 of all accidents between large trucks and cars take place in the &quot;No-Zone&quot; located in large blind spots. Truck drivers should be fully aware of these limitations and drive with caution accordingly.</li><br>   <li><strong>Fatigue</strong> -&#xA0;Federal regulation states that commercial truck drivers cannot drive more than 10 consecutive hours, or more than 11 hours in a day, yet 13% of truck accidents are caused by the truck driver&apos;s fatigue.</li><br>    <li><strong>Illegal Maneuver</strong> - 9% of truck accidents are caused by a truck driver not following the rules of the road. While drivers of all vehicles should always follow traffic laws, truck drivers should be extra cautious as their vehicles are 25-50 times the size of others on the road.</li><br>    <li><strong>Exterior Distraction</strong> - Risky behavior while driving, such as&#xA0;&#xA0;talking on a cell phone, eating, reading, or adjusting the radio, accounts for 8% of trucking accidents.</li><br>    <li><strong>Inadequate Evasive Action</strong> -&#xA0;In the 3/4 of a second it takes for the brain to send the signal to brake to the time the foot actually applies the brake, a truck can travel over 60 feet. 7% of all trucking accidents are caused by a driver failing to slow or brake in sufficient time for stopped or stopping traffic.</li><br>   <li><strong>Aggressive Driving Behavior</strong> - 7% of accidents are caused by a truck driver not taking in account their visibility limitations or pure size of their vehicle while disobeying traffic laws, whether it be following too closely or cutting off other drivers on the road.</li><br></ol><br>&quot;Given &#xA0;the size and weight of these trucks, this negligence often leads to devastating injuries and death to whomever in the vehicle they hit,&quot; says Steve Crandall, a top-rated attorney throughout Ohio and Kentucky whose specialties include commercial truck accidents.<br><br><strong>If you or a loved one are involved in a trucking accident, it is critical to act quickly and retain an experienced lawyer to ensure evidence is gathered to help bring these cases forward.&#xA0;</strong><br><br><strong>Please contact Steve Crandall if you have any questions regarding your commercial truck accident.</strong>&#xA0;Steve will provide you and your family with a free, no-obligation case review.<br><br></div>

<strong>With a growing number of iniatitives to control health care costs championed in recent years, doctors are looking for patients to be more cost conscious.</strong>

Programs such as pay-for-performance, where doctors earn money by meeting quality &quot;goals&quot; like controlling patients&apos; high blood pressure, and accountable care organizations, where clinicians and hospitals in partnership are paid a lump sum to cover all care, are aiming to replace the current model in which doctors are reimbursed for every office visit, test or procedure performed.

While health professionals claim to be open to controlling costs, they cite the fact that they must also consider their patient&apos;s opinions and willingness to be cost conscious when it comes to their own care as potential obstacles.

&quot;We need to begin to talk about these issues in a way that doesn&apos;t turn it into a discussion pitting money against life...&quot; said Dr. Susan Dorr Gold, professor of internal medicine and health management and policy at the University of Michigan. &quot;Because it&apos;s going to be tough otherwise trying to implement any cost-saving measures, if patients don&apos;t accept them.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="Getting Patients to Think About Costs" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/getting-patients-to-think-about-costs/" target="_blank">Getting Patients to Think About Costs</a></strong>

Too often medical malpractice occurs as physicians do not order needed studies, tests or consultations out of fear of increasing costs. This can lead to delays in diagnosis, wrongful death and birth injuries in many cases.

<strong>Kadcyla, a first-of-a-kind breast cancer medication that targets tumor cells while sparing healthy ones, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</strong>

Researchers believe the drug may offer a clear advantage over older drugs because it delivers more medication with fewer side effects due to a binding chemical.

The FDA approved the new treatment for about 20% of breast cancer patients with a more aggressive form of the disease that is typically less responsive to hormone therapy. Researchers reported last year that patients treated with Kadcyla lived 9.6 months before death of the spread of their disease, compared with a little more than six months for patients treated with other standard drugs. Read the full details here:

Despite many medical advances breast cancer claims thousands of lives&#xA0;every year. Vigilant exams, regular mammography and treatment&#xA0;breakthroughs like this will continue to increase the survival rate of&#xA0;breast cancer.

<strong>Major medical specialty groups have recommended that doctors greatly reduce their use of 90 &quot;widely used but largely unnecessary tests and treatments&quot;, including echocardiograms and early induction of labor.</strong>

Each medical specialty society participating in the initiative, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Geriatrics Society, offered up five procedures that patients should question that have little evidence of benefit and may cause harm.

&quot;The goal is to begin to change attitudes both from the public side and the physician side that sometimes less is better,&quot; said Daniel Wolfson, executive vice president of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation. Read the full details of the list of &quot;overused medical tests&quot; here:

While no physician should order unneeded tests for a patient, putting a list together like this is dangerous for patient care. It may encourage a care provider to not order a study when it is, in fact, warranted. Patients need to be informed of all of their options and their risks.

<strong>A class-action lawsuit last month has prohibited Medicare from denying patients coverage for reaching a &quot;plateau,&quot; meaning their conditions are not improving.</strong>

Medicare patients with chronic health problems or disabilities that require nursing care, home health services or outpatient therapy will be able to continue to receive the skilled care they need for as long as they need it, as long as they meet other coverage criteria.

The settlement is expected to affect thousands, and possibly millions, of Medicare beneficiaries with chronic health problems like Parkinson&apos;s or Alzheimer&apos;s disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries. Coverage will continue as long as it is considered medically necessary by the patient&apos;s physician.

Congress also continued for another year a little-known process that allows exceptions to what Medicare pays for physical, occupational and speech therapy. The Medicare limits before the exceptions are $1,900 for physical and speech therapy this year, and $1,900 for occupational therapy. Read the full details here:

<strong>A study recently published in the journal BMC Medicine suggests caffeine consumption during pregnancy has no link to preterm birth, but <em>does</em> raise the risk of having a low birth weight baby.</strong>

While in utero, a child expected to weigh about eight pounds at birth loses between three-quarters of an ounce to an ounce in birth weight for each 100 milligrams of average daily caffeine intake (equivalent to one eight-once cup of regular brewed coffee) from all sources by the mother, according to the findings.

This research conflicts with current guidelines on safe amounts of caffeine consumption during pregnancy; the World Health Organization recommends a limit of 300 milligrams of caffeine a day, while the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists limits that amount to 200 milligrams.

While the study is not definitive, it is recommended that women put their caffeine consumption &quot;on pause&quot; while pregnant, or at least stay below two cups of coffee per day. Read the full details here:

<strong>Delayed treatment after an emergency room misdiagnosis could have cost a Parma Heights, Ohio teen his life last April.</strong>

When James Finnerty, a 15-year-old rugby player, exhibited symptoms including a piercing pain in his head and vomiting, the ER doctors where he sought treatment assumed he had a severe migraine. When his mother insisted he be transferred to Cleveland Clinic 25 hours later, it was discovered he had suffered a stroke.

About 3,000 children a year will suffer a stroke, which is also one of the top 10 causes of death among children.&#xA0;The average delay in diagnosis of pediatric stroke cases is 28 hours, wasting precious time when a child could get life-saving medication.

James had to have part of his skull removed to relieve the pressure of the intense swelling in his brain and, in a second stroke, lost the use of speech and his limbs, from which he is now luckily on the road to recovery.

Because his diagnosis was delayed to the point of herniation to the brain, the chance of James dying was &quot;really high,&quot; according to Dr. Neil Friedman, a pediatric neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Read the full details here:

Medical malpractice that includes the failure to diagnose stroke in all ages leads to devastating injuries to the stroke victim and their entire family. As the stroke victim suffers irreversible brain damage or paralysis, staggering medical care costs make caring for the stroke victim difficult.

<strong>&quot;Morbidity and mortality&quot; - or M&amp;M - conferences emerged in the early 20th century as a way for physicians to review cases that had gone wrong behind closed doors, away from patients and families.</strong>

In the medical world, surgery M&amp;Ms are especially known for their confrontations, as more experienced surgeons often browbeat younger doctors into admitting their errors and promising to never make them again.

In time, these conferences have largely been abandoned for a &quot;systems approach&quot; to medical errors, where the idea is to look at the root causes of errors and to devise systems to prevent them.

Medical professionals have argued that elaborate systems for preventing errors can at times interfere with getting things done in the hospital. Meanwhile, a 1999 study reported that medical errors killed close to 100,000 Americans annually. Read the full details here:

&#xA0;

Medical malpractice, wrongful death, failure to diagnose and medication&#xA0;errors occur thousands of times a year and are hidden in mortality and&#xA0;morbidity conferences. Laws in many states allow physicians to discuss these cases amongst themselves, while continuing to conceal information from patients and their families.

<strong>The Food and Drug Administration has demanded additional tests of potential heart risks in a new long-acting insulin, potentially delaying its approval in the U.S. until 2015 or 2016.</strong>

Novo Nordisk, the Danish drug maker and world&apos;s biggest insulin maker, had been banking on the drug Tresiba to keep it in the lead in diabetes care. Tresiba and Ryzodeg have been widely predicted to become multibillion-dollar sellers worldwide, but concerns about their cardiovascular safety still remain, even after being approved in Europe and Japan.

The FDA&apos;s decision to issue Novo a complete response letter signifies the company&apos;s application cannot be approved in its existing form.

&quot;We are surprised and disappointed to receive this letter, but we acknowledge this decision by the FDA and will work with the agency to determine the best path forward to completing the review,&quot; said Lards Rebien Sorensen, Novo&apos;s chief executive, in a statement.

The FDA is finally looking into the possible bad side effects of&#xA0;medication before putting them on the market, despite some good effects.&#xA0;Too often drug companies are successful in rushing their defective drugs&#xA0;and products to the market before they are adequately tested thereby&#xA0;resulting in wrongful death and product liability claims.

<strong>How much should a hip replacement cost? $11,100? $125,798?</strong>

The difference in figures may seem extreme, but those are just some of the actual quotes a woman received over the phone from more than 100 hospitals in every state last summer, half of which could not provide any sort of price estimate.

The continuous growth of American health care costs are part of an opaque medical system in which prices are often hidden from consumers. Even received quotes can largely underestimate the actual price of procedures because they do not include fees for outpatient rehabilitation or similar care costs.

&quot;If one hospital can put in a hip for $12,000, then every hospital should be able to do it,&quot; said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. &quot;When there&apos;s 100 percent variation in sticker price, then there is no real price. It&apos;s about profit.&quot; Read the full details here:

Increasing health care costs are too often blamed on medical malpractice, wrongful death or birth injury/birth trauma verdicts when, in fact, the industry itself is to blame for sky rocketing health costs.

<strong>A hip implant recalled by Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2010 has been estimated to fail within five years in nearly 40 percent of patients who received it, according to an internal analysis by the company.</strong>

Hip implants often last for 15 years before they wear out and need to be replaced. The early replacement rate is typically 1 percent after a year, or 5 percent at five years.

The trouble surround the Articular Surface Replacement (A.S.R.), a device in which both cup and ball components are made of metal, represents one of the biggest medical device failures in recent decades. About 93,000 patients worldwide received an A.S.R., about one-third of them in the United States.

Surgeons have largely abandoned using these all-metal devices in standard hip replacements because their components can grind together, releasing metallic debris that damages a patient&apos;s tissue and bone.

A forthcoming trial is expected to shed light on what officials of Johnson &amp; Johnson&apos;s DePuy Orthopaedics division knew about the device&apos;s problem before its recall and the actions they took or did not take. Read the full details here:

The reason for the association between antidepressants and stillbirths may have been the psychiatric illness of depression itself, rather than the treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.&apos;s.

The rate of stillbirths and deaths under age 1 was higher among women who used S.S.R.I.&apos;s than the population at large, but those differences disappeared after the researchers adjusted for previous hospitalization for depression and other factors. Read the full details here:

<strong>A group of doctors at an Ohio community hospital settled with the Justice Department over accusations that some of the unusually high rates of heart procedures performed on patients were medically unnecessary, according to&#xA0;<em>The New York Times</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

Medicare patients at the EMH Regional Medical Center in Elyria were receiving angioplasties at a rate nearly four times the national average. The procedure often required insertion of a stent to keep a clogged blood vessel from closing again.

Federal regulators accused the doctors and the hospital of performing expensive and inappropriate medical treatments from 2001 to 2006 because of the high fees the procedures generated. The hospital agreed to pay $3.9 million to settle the accusations.

Besides the cost to Medicare, &quot;performing medically unnecessary cardiac procedures puts patients&apos; lives at risk,&quot; said Steven M. Dettelbach, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, who was involved in the investigation. &quot;Patient health and taxpayer dollars have to come before greed.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>Researchers have found that there have been nearly 10,000 reported instances of &quot;never events&quot;, or surgical mistakes that have no legitimate reason for their ever happening, within the past 20 years.</strong>

These mistakes, which include a surgeon leaving a foreign object in a patient&apos;s body, performing surgery on the wrong part of the body, or performing the wrong surgery entirely, cost the healthcare industry an estimated $1.3 billion in malpractice payments over the 20 year time period.

Researchers at John Hopkins University believe these staggering figures largely underestimate the number of never events that actually occur throughout the United States, since prior studies have shown that most patients do not file medical claims when a mistake is made.

This fact has allowed these life-threatening mistakes to continue to occur at unacceptable rates. Read the full details here:

<strong>As the beginning of a new genetic age in cancer research mounts, three pharmaceutical companies are poised to test whether new drugs can work against a wide range of cancers independently of where they originated.</strong>

Such drugs could mean new treatments for rare, neglected cancers, as well as common ones affecting the breast, prostate, liver and lung. The drugs go after an aberration involving a cancer gene fundamental to tumor growth.

Merck, Roche and Sanofi are racing to develop their own versions of a drug they hope will restore a mechanism that normally makes badly damaged cells self-destruct and could potentially be used against half of all cancers.

&quot;This is a taste of the future in cancer drug development,&quot; said Dr. Otis Webb Brawley, the chief medical and scientific officer of the American Cancer Society. &quot;I expect the organ from which the cancer came from will be less important in the future and the molecular target more important.&quot; Read the full details here:

Until the cure for cancer is found, the disease will continue to claim the lives of millions. Unfortunately, many die due to the failure to diagnose cancer when it should have been found earlier on radiology studies or lab studies ignored by physicians.

<strong>It is estimated that about one in 20 hospitalized patients get an infection, resulting in up to $33 billion in additional costs each year, according to researchers in the&#xA0;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</strong>

A Medicare payment policy designed to push hospitals to cut their infection rates has had no effect in reducing bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections associate with the use of central lines or catheters among patient in intensive care units.

In 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began denying additional payments to hospitals whose patients became sicker as a result of these two types of preventable infections.

&quot;The financial penalty did not further reduce infection rates, which were already going down because of multitude of (infection control) campaigns and interventions that were already ongoing,&quot; said the study&apos;s lead author Grace Lee, associate professor, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and Harvard Medical School.

Efforts to reduce the rate of infections include public reporting requirements and the payment policy in Medicare, which is now being expanded into state Medicaid programs. Read the full details here:

<strong>New research concludes that there is little benefit for annual physical exams when it comes to healthy people.</strong>

A study analyzing &#xA0;information from 183,000 people in the U.S. and Europe showed patients who received routine health checks were just as likely to die over a nine-year period compared with those who did not receive health checks.

Eliminating annual physicals, including colonoscopies and mammograms, would also save money partly because it would reduce unnecessary testing, according to Campos-Outcalt.

<strong>A second wave of serious infections from the same tainted drug that caused a nationwide meningitis outbreak is now ongoing, according to&#xA0;The New York Times.</strong>

The drug, which contaminated nearly 14,000 people with a fungus that caused a public health disaster now in its fourth month, is now causing infections near the spinal injection site where it was used to treat chronic back or neck pain.

These spinal infections, including abscesses, can be dangerous and hard to detect. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged doctors to consider M.R.I. scans even in patients who did not feel worse after the injection, but whose existing back or neck pain simply did not get better.

The disease outbreak, which resulted in 620 illnesses in 19 states and 39 deaths, was caused by batches of methylpresnisolone acetate made by the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Mass. which were contaminated by a black mold. The treatment is a long course of antifungal drugs, which can have dangerous side effects.

The company was shut down and recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Read the full details here:

&quot;This tainted drug continues to cause injuries, wrongful death, pain and suffering, and other damages to those who were unlucky to have received it,&quot; said Steve Crandall,&#xA0;a top-rated medical malpractice attorney throughout Ohio and Kentucky.

&quot;Worse yet, the company is filing bankruptcy to avoid liability from patients who will rightfully sue the company for damages.&quot;

<strong>The family of Daniel Hughes, the Ohio State freshman who was hit by a dump truck on campus September 5, has filed negligence lawsuits against the university and several contractors.</strong>

Hughes, 18, lost his right leg and suffered severe damage to his pelvis and spine as a result of the accident.&#xA0;His parents and three siblings are suing Ohio State; the driver of the dump truck, 71-year-old Isaac Hinton of the East Side; and 10 contractors hired by OSU, saying they failed to take the necessary precautions to keep students safe in what they knew was a densely packed area, according to the lawsuits filed by attorneys Steve Crandall and Marc Pera.

Hughes told police that he had been walking his bike on the sidewalk when he saw the dump truck traveling next to him. Without warning, he said, the truck made a sharp right turn into the construction area. Hughes said he yelled at the driver to stop, but the truck ran him over.

The lawsuits say Ohio State and the construction contractors failed to provide flaggers, security officers or to take other precautions to protect pedestrians and bicyclists. Read more here:

When a physician has the life of you or a loved one in his or her hands, it is of the utmost importance that they are functioning at the highest level of competency. Here are four questions to ask yourself about your doctor in order to determine whether or not it is time to look elsewhere:<strong>&#xA0;</strong>

<strong>1. Is he/she a team player?</strong>
A good doctor presents options, makes a specific recommendation -- going with a surgical procedure or medication -- and explains why he or she believes it&apos;s the best. Beware of doctors who have little time for questions, or say things like, &quot;This is really the only way.&quot;

<strong>2. Does he/she communicate well?</strong>
When it comes to coordinating with other physicians, check that your doctor is talking to other providers involved in your care. If your physician is asking whether you&apos;ve had a certain procedure done or what treatments you&apos;ve had, it&apos;s clear he or she hasn&apos;t reviewed your file.

<strong>3. Is he/she up to date?</strong>
Burnout means exhaustion, which could mean your doctor is behind on recent medical journals or the latest technology. Your physician should be willing to work with information you present him or her, and share an educated opinion.

<strong>4. Does he/she pay attention?</strong>
Look for body language that your physician is all there -- facing you, looking up frequently even when entering information into files, nodding, and maintaining eye contact. Read more here:

&quot;Physicians are wrongly protected by tort reform laws, allowing thousands of cases of medical malpractice to go unchecked each year,&quot; says&#xA0;Steve Crandall, a medical malpractice attorney in Ohio and Kentucky.

Patients throughout the United States are injured by failure to diagnose cancer, birth trauma and birth injuries and lose family members to wrongful death while their physicians are protected by laws designed to cap damages even though malpractice occurred.&#xA0;<strong>If you feel you have suffered from medical malpractice,</strong>&#xA0;<strong>call the offices of Crandall &amp; Pera Law today</strong>.

<strong>A new study finds that emergency surgeries performed on a weekend may have poorer results than the same operation performed on a weekday.</strong>

Patients who were admitted on the weekend and received emergency surgery for ulcerative colitis were about 70 percent more likely to have complications than those admitted on weekdays, according to researchers who studied over 7,000 emergency surgeries for Crohn&apos;s disease and ulcerative colitis.

Postoperative infections were 50 percent more likely in weekend ulcerative colitis patients, pulmonary complications were twice as common, and the risk for wound complications and repeat surgery was 10 times as high even though there were no reported differences between weekday and weekend admissions in age or gender, the presence of other illnesses, or in-hospital deaths between the two groups.

&quot;This doesn&apos;t mean that if you&apos;re admitted on a weekend, you should fight surgery,&quot; said Dr. Ashwin N. Ananthakrishnan, an assistant professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. &quot;But the question is why this happens - it&apos;s apparently not because of patient factors. Is it infrastructure, provider experience? It&apos;s important to find out what causes these disparities.&quot; Read the full details here:

In many cases of medical malpractice, wrongful death and surgical errors, timing is everything for the patient. It is good practice to avoid surgery on weekends, during holidays or in July when new residents populate a hospital as an increase of medical and medication errors often occur.

<strong>Having an empathetic doctor can actually decrease your pain awareness, according to a new study published in Patient Education and Counseling, which makes finding the&#xA0;<em>right&#xA0;</em>doctor all the more important.</strong>

&quot;The degree to which patients develop a positive relationship with their doctors determines how their brains react to stress and experience pain,&quot; says Issidoros Sarinopoulos, Ph.D., a professor of radiology at Michigan State University. This relationship can influence how your body recovers and affect your overall health.

There are six primary traits to look for in your current or potential new doctor:
<ol>
    <li><strong>He/she is empathetic</strong> - Patients are more satisfied by doctors who go beyond asking only very clinical information (such as medical history and current medications) and also ask open-ended questions about their home life and work as well as any concerns they may have about an upcoming procedure.</li>
    <li><strong>He/she takes time</strong> - Sometimes the 17 minutes the average doctor spends to listen to, diagnose, and prescribe the best treatment doesn&apos;t cut it. You should leave your appointment with answers to all of your questions and not feel pushed through your visit.</li>
    <li><strong>He/she is alert and well-rested</strong> - It&apos;s within your rights as a patient to ask if your doctor is rested. A sleepless night clouds next-day judgment, so be aware if your doctor is constantly yawning or has circles under his/her eyes.</li>
    <li><strong>He/she is up-to-date on the latest research</strong> - When it comes to your general practitioner, who won&apos;t be performing newfangled tests or procedures, mid-career doctors have a good balance of current knowledge and work experience. Physicians who work at teaching hospitals are regularly vetted by their peers and have to stay up-to-date to continually teach interns.</li>
    <li><strong>He/she doesn&apos;t judge you or dismiss your concerns</strong> - Not being able to talk to your doctor about your sex life, drinking habits, and anything else that can affect your health without feeling judged can affect your treatment. If you feel your lifestyle choices are criticized or concerns dismissed, look for someone else.</li>
    <li><strong>He/she keeps it professional</strong> - A doctor should be friendly, but not flirtatious. Keep in mind that more doctors than ever are now Googling their patients. If you hear your doctor discussing personal details you didn&apos;t divulge, ask how he/she got that information.</li>
</ol>
Many physicians are overworked and forced to add patients, procedures and unneeded studies in an effort to earn the same, or even lesser, wages as before. This crisis is due to the ever shrinking reimbursement they receive from Medicare, Medicaid and even private insurance companies. The increase in volume often leads to medical mistakes and medical malpractice as well.

<strong>Hospital efforts to cut back long hours for medical residents in order to improve patient safety has proven to have the opposite effect, according to two new studies in the<em>&#xA0;Journal of the American Medical Association</em>.</strong>

Since a medical oversight board decreased the length of time a young doctor can work without taking a break from 30 hours to 16 in 2011, medical errors harming patients increased 15% to 20% among residents compared with residents who worked longer shifts. This may be largely due to the number of &quot;handoff risks&quot; when a patient&apos;s care changes hands.

Both reports found residents with shorter hours failed to increase the amount of sleep they get overall per week. Among a sample of 2,323 interns at more than 40 teaching hospitals, 20% of the residents also screened positive for depression.

&quot;Teaching hospitals haven&apos;t invested in providing extra help to shoulder any of the clinical work that has to be done,&quot; says Elizabeth Wiley, president of the American Medical Student Association. &quot;It could be the interns are required to do the same amount of work in less time.&quot; Read the full story here:

<a title="Studies: Residents make more errors on shorter shifts" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2013/03/25/residents-health-medical-errors-hospitals/2018873/" target="_blank"><strong>Studies: Residents make more errors on shorter shifts</strong></a>

Decreasing the hours a resident-physician in training can work&#xA0;consecutively has proven to have opposite effects; more medical errors and&#xA0;medical malpractice occur on their shift. It may be that the hours&#xA0;worked are not the issue, but rather the amount of patients and staffing at U.S.&#xA0;hospitals.

<strong>When a patient goes under the knife, they are essentially putting their lives in the hands of what they believe to be a competent, qualified surgeon. But what happens when this professional makes a mistake as egregious as operating on the wrong body part?</strong>

This was the case for the Matlock family of Vancouver, Washington in 2011 when their 4-year-old son went in for surgery to correct a wandering right eye. The eye surgeon operated on their son&apos;s left eye before realizing the mistake and then repeated the same operation on the correct eye.

&quot;She said, &apos;frankly, I lost sense of direction and didn&apos;t realize I had operated on the wrong eye until I was done operating on the eye,&apos;&quot; said the boy&apos;s mother.

While the left eye currently shows no signs of long-term damage, future problems remain to be seen as the boy grows older. The hospital where the surgical mistake took place has only offered to settle the case outside of court for up to $50,000, without publicly acknowledging the mistake. Read the full details here:

<strong>Malpractice sought after surgeon operates on wrong eye</strong>

Operations on the wrong body part, medication errors, and the leaving of instruments, sponges and surgical towels in a patient&apos;s body are commonplace in today&apos;s healthcare community. These errors lead to medical malpractice, wrongful death and various injuries causing pain and suffering and even brain damage.

<strong>Questions continue to arise about the future of the compounding industry after 50 people were killed starting last fall by tainted steroid injections distributed by the New England Compounding Center.</strong>

Because most of the 2,700 pharmacists in the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists (IACP) are much smaller than drug manufacturers, they have answered primarily to state pharmacy boards rather than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

While FDA inspections have been met with unease and confusion, they have proven necessary&#xA0;as 14 recent risk-based inspections at compounding pharmacies known to mix large quantities of sterile drugs have yielded deficiency findings so far. These FDA findings, including how pharmacies had been deficient in practices to maintain sterility, which included keeping skin covered and maintaining proper air flow, have been <a title="published online" href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/ucm340853.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published online</a>.

In order to close perceived loopholes, laws in 17 states have begun to make their way through state legislatures, some examining whether accreditation should be mandatory for compounding pharmacies, and others clarifying what constitutes a proper prescription.

&quot;The FDA&apos;s authority over compounding companies is limited but not nonexistent,&quot; said Sarah Clark-Lynn, FDA spokeswoman. &quot;While the current FDA oversight over compounding pharmacies is limited, the agency continues to use its existing authorities to protect consumers.&quot; Read the full details here:

<a title="Compounding Pharmacists Await Changes After Fungal Meningitis Scandal" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/compounding-pharmacists-face-fungal-meningitis-outbreak/story?id=18718941#.UVCZXhzvsoq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Compounding Pharmacists Await Changes After Fungal Meningitis Scandal</strong></a>

The FDA had been cut out of the regulatory loop for compounding pharmacies, a law which only recently took effect and was clearly misguided. The recent fungal infection which led to numerous injuries and wrongful death, will spotlight the need for change.

<strong>A chemical commonly used in everyday products could potentially impact the birth weight and long-term health of newborn babies, according to a recent study.</strong>

Bisphenol A, or BPA, is used in everything from food-can linings to plastic containers, and its high levels in pregnant mothers have been found to produce babies that grow about 20 percent slower in the womb than women with low levels. A slow rate of growth can lead to a low birth weight, and low-birth-weight babies are more likely to suffer developmental delays than normal-weight babies. Recent studies have also tied the chemical to increased asthma rates in children and to genetic changes that can impair a child&apos;s neurological development.

Even though the Food and Drug Administration has banned the use of BPA in products aimed at children, such as baby bottles and sippy cups, much of the damage BPA causes occurs when babies are still in the womb. The body eliminates BPA relatively quickly, but we are exposed to it from so many different sources that most people have constant low levels in their bodies, making total avoidance nearly impossible.

Here are a few ways to keep your BPA exposures to an absolute minimum:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kick canned food out of your kitchen.</strong> The linings contain BPA. Opt for fresh or frozen foods and those packaged in aseptic cartons.</li>
    <li><strong>Pay in cash...or ask for no receipt.</strong> The thermal papers used to print receipts are coated with BPA or with a very similar chemical called BPS. Both BPA and BPS are endocrine disruptors, so decline receipts whenever you can.</li>
    <li><strong>Go plastic free.</strong> Avoid #7 polycarbonate plastics, especially if you&apos;re storing food or drinks. Instead, opt for containers made of glass, food-grade stainless steel, or ceramic.</li>
</ul>
The effects of BPA products is only beginning to be understood. It is clear BPA can cause birth defects, low birth weight and issues concerning the development and growth of fetus&apos; and children.

<strong>Out of every 1,000 newborns, two will suffer from an injury to the brachial plexus, a group of nerves in the spinal cord that controls motor functions in the elbow, shoulders and hands.</strong>

Brachial plexus injuries commonly occur as a result of medical negligence and malpractice when excessive force is used to unlodge a newborn&apos;s shoulders from the birth canal or reposition an infant from the breech (feet first) position. A brachial plexus can lead to total brachial plexus palsy, Klumpke&apos;s palsy, Erb&apos;s palsy and paralysis.

There are four levels of severity when it comes to brachial plexus injuries:
<ol>
    <li>Neuropaxia - A stretching injury that does shocks the nerves rather than tearing or ripping them. This is the least severe form and usually heals without medical treatment.</li>
    <li>Neuroma - A stretching injury that damages a few nerve fibers, but is possible to recover from.</li>
    <li>Rupture - Nerves are torn during the birthing process.</li>
    <li>Avulsion - The brachial plexus nerves are severely torn and separate from the spinal cord. This is both the most severe and most common form of injury.</li>
</ol>
These injuries occur frequently when a woman has been in labor for an extended period of time; medical professionals overseeing the birth should be vigilant to care for the mother and child and stop long-term and avoidable damage to the child.

Brachial plexus injuries can result in exorbitant costs for long-term care and special education. Any parent of a child with one of these four types of injuries should investigate whether it was caused by medical negligence, as a significant number of brachial plexus injuries are preventable if the mother&#x2019;s labor and delivery are appropriately managed.

<strong>Almost 750 U.S. hospitals claimed to be the &quot;best&quot; or &quot;top&quot; in at least one specialty in 2011, but how many of these claims can you actually trust?</strong>

With hospital evaluation ratings each using its own methodology, and often coming to very different conclusions, these distinctions could be dangerously confusing for consumers who regularly consult online rankings or reviews of medical facilities. While some hospitals could be rated as outstanding by one group, these same facilities could be rated differently year to year or ignored or panned by another group altogether.

Since patient safety rankings are based on how frequently correct procedures or errors occur, hospitals can get good grades even if they have made some egregious errors that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.

For example, the St. Mary Mercy Livonia Hospital in Michigan was given an &quot;A&quot; by the Leapfrog Group, a respected nonprofit that promotes patient safety, and named of of American&apos;s best 50 hospitals by Healthgrades. But Consumer Reports gave the same hospital an average safety score of 47 points out of 100, citing high numbers of readmissions, poor communication with patients and excessive use of scans.

&quot;Ratings and ranking programs certainly offer people information they can use to make their hospital selections, but we don&apos;t recommend relying on any one of them completely,&quot; said Jennifer Kennedy, a spokeswoman for St. Mary Mercy. &quot;None are able to tell the whole story or paint a complete picture of the care that is delivered.&quot; Read the full story here:

Hospitals who perform routinely negligent care and do not communicate with patients and their families nonetheless end up at the top of lists of the best hospitals. A great deal of this is dependent over who will pay exorbitant fees to the publications and &quot;organizations&quot; who are responsible for this rating.

<strong>Summer will not just bring longer days and warmer weather but also an increased chance of catching a potentially fatal drug-resistant bacteria,&#xA0;according to a new study in the&#xA0;American Journal of Epidemiology.</strong>

Methycillin-resistant staphylococcus auereus, MRSA for short, are best known for causing skin infections but can also get into your body and cause pneumonia or potentially fatal bloodstream infections, responsible for 10,000 to 20,000 deaths per year.

Community-associated MRSA that peak in the summer in fitness centers, schools, and other public places that force close contact with other people can be more harmful than MRSA strains you might contract in hospitals and affect children the most.

The study&apos;s authors propose the following precautions as a first line of defense:
<ul>
    <li>Avoid unnecessary antibiotics in the winter - Doctors hand out antibiotics for a whole slew of unresponsive respiratory infections during the winter. When the antibiotic pressure is removed in the summertime, infections are able to spread due to the effect on resistance.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands frequently.</li>
    <li>Shower before and after visiting pools, hot tubs, and saunas.</li>
    <li>Keep any open wounds covered.</li>
    <li>Shower after going to the gym or participating in a sporting event, and wash your workout clothes after each visit to the gym.</li>
</ul>
MRSA infections and other antibiotic resistant infections are widespread in the hospital and nursing home population. These infections can lead to devastating results including amputation, sepsis, medical malpractice and wrongful death.

BODY:
<strong>Due to the large number of medical malpractice claims a year - for everything from mistakes in treatment to an uninformed patient - the topic has wide currency in medical circles. But can you really believe everything you read?</strong>

One can easily find common malpractice myths that are both mistaken and misleading in a variety of media, from op-eds and blog postings, to public statements by physicians of all specialties, including those designated as spokespersons for organized medicine.

The 5 Myths of Medical Malpractice are as follows:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Malpractice crises are caused by spikes in medical malpractice litigation (i.e., sudden rises in payouts and claim frequency)</strong>.&#xA0;While this may be natural to believe, both federal and state studies have found that both the frequency of malpractice claiming and the frequency of paid medical malpractice claims per physician has been dropping steadily since 1992, and is now less than one-half the level it was in 1992.</li>
    <li><strong>The tort system delivers &quot;jackpot justice</strong>.<strong>&quot; </strong>This basic charge is that the system doles out compensation randomly - uninjured patients take home millions, whereas those who suffer grievously receive little or nothing at all. A far larger and more realistic problem, however, is that an enormous fraction of patients who are harmed by medical negligence either make no effort to recover damages or cannot find lawyers willing to take their cases. These patients, who are entitled to compensation, never initiate claims. Thus, the liability system is simultaneously beset by overclaiming and underclaiming.</li>
    <li><strong>Physicians are one malpractice verdict away from bankruptcy. </strong>Many physicians seem to believe that malpractice verdicts threaten to wipe out their savings. In reality, out-of-pocket payments by physicians are extraordinarily rare, particularly when physicians have policy limits of or above $500,000. When payments above the policy limits are made, whether in tried or settled cases, they almost always come from insurers.</li>
    <li><strong>Physicians move in large numbers to states that adopt damages caps</strong>.&#xA0;If physicians relocate because of liability risk, damages caps are an obvious strategy for attracting more physicians, particularly in lawsuit-prone specialties. Although a nationwide cap would actually reduce relocations by making this incentive disappear, studies have shown that physician supply was not measurably stunted prior to reform, and it did not measurably improve after reform. While damages caps may play a small role in attracting and keeping physicians practicing in rural areas and in high-risk specialties, the evidence is mixed, and some studies have found no effect.</li>
    <li><strong>Tort regorm will lower health-care spending dramatically</strong>. When it comes to the malpractice liability system, it is important to distinguish between the direct costs (cost of malpractice awards and settlements and all costs associated with defending against such claims) and indirect costs (incurred when providers take steps to reduce their perceived likelihood of being sued, such as by running extra tests). Because tort reforms make lawsuits less likely and less expensive, they may reduce defensive medicine and thereby reduce healthcare spending, but since the direct costs of the malpractice system are on the order of 2% of health-care spending, any costs would not be affected dramatically.</li>
</ol>
<div>Damage caps do little to improve the malpractice system as they do not make healthcare safer, reduce healthcare spending, compensate those who are negligently injured, or make the liability system work better. The best reforms are patient safety initiatives that reduce the frequency and severity of medical mistakes. Ideally, the liability system would encourage providers to adopt patient-protecting innovations above everything else.</div>

<strong>More than one in five nursing homes in the United States have been found to administer antipsychotic drugs to patients whose conditions do not warrant their use, exposing them to dangerous side effects, according to recent data.</strong>

Antipsychotics are commonly being prescribed to control agitation and combative behavior in residents who should not be receiving the powerful sedatives, especially patients who have Alzheimer&apos;s or other forms of dementia. Roughly 185,000 nursing home residents in the U.S. received these drugs in 2010 contrary to federal nursing home regulators&apos; recommendations.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued black-box warnings - the agency&apos;s most serious medication alert - about potentially fatal side effects when antipsychotics are taken by patients with dementia. The drugs, which are intended to treat severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, can leave people in a stupor.

&quot;We have an inordinate amount of prescriptions written for a population that is already frail, and we know these drugs increase the risk for side effects, including death,&quot; said Dr. Michael Gloth, a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine associate professor who specializes in the care of elderly patients. &quot;So why are they being written?&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="A&#xA0;rampant prescription, a hidden peril" href="http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/articles/2012/04/29/nursing_home_residents_with_dementia_often_given_antipsychotics_despite_health_warnings/?page=full" target="_blank">A&#xA0;rampant prescription, a hidden peril</a></strong>

Nursing home negligence is widespread in Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Too often the elderly or sick in nursing homes are subjected to malpractice, neglect or the improper use of medications to sedate the patients in an effort to allow inadequate staffing to continue.

<strong>With March being Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, you may be hearing a lot about the importance of screening, especially for those over age 50. But is there a time when colon cancer screening should stop?</strong>

That answer is yes, according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force; they recommended against routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults over age 75 and against any screening in those over 85 as far back as 2008. But older patients continue to be screened at alarming rates, even while benefits diminish and risks increase.

While medical guidelines call for a repeat test 10 years after the first negative colonoscopy, studies have shown that nearly half of patients with negative colonoscopies had another screening in less than seven years, often within three or five. About a quarter took place without any clear medical indication.

Colon cancer develops slowly, and, as difficult as it is to acknowledge, most elderly patients will have died of other diseases in the many years it takes for small polyps to evolve into cancer. Meanwhile, unnecessary screenings and surgeries can cause extreme pain for patients with no real benefit. Read the full details here:

Many patients are injured or suffer wrongful death, due to unnecessary&#xA0;medical procedures. &#xA0; Colonoscopies, while providing useful information&#xA0;about cancer, are not without their risks, so&#xA0;indications for the study must be apparent before a colonoscopy is&#xA0;performed.

<strong>Around 2/3 of female patients with ovarian cancer receive inadequate care, missing out on treatments that could add years to their lives, according to a new study.</strong>

The main reason for poor care is that most of the 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed annually in the U.S. are treated by doctors and hospitals that see few cases of the disease and lack expertise in the complex surgery and chemotherapy that can prolong life. Immediate and proper treatment could help save many of the 15,000 women the disease kills a year in the U.S. alone, as it is usually discovered while already in an advanced stage.

Meticulous, extensive surgery and aggressive chemotherapy are found to treat the disease best as the cancer usually spreads into the abdomen. The surgery may involve removing the spleen, parts of the intestine, stomach and other organs, as well as the reproductive system, to give the drugs a better chance of killing whatever cancer is left.

Operations should be done by gynecologic oncologists, not general surgeons or gynecologists, experts say. Surgeons who lack expertise in ovarian cancer should refer women to specialists if the women are suspected to have the disease, but often do not, says Dr. Barbara A. Goff, a professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Washington, in Seattle. Read the full story here:

<a title="Widespread Flaws Found in Ovarian Cancer Treatment" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/health/ovarian-cancer-study-finds-widespread-flaws-in-treatment.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><strong>Widespread Flaws Found in Ovarian Cancer Treatment</strong></a>

Ovarian cancer is difficult to diagnose however the failure or a delay in&#xA0;diagnosis of ovarian cancer and other forms of cancer leads to medical&#xA0;negligence, medical malpractice and wrongful death. The treatment of&#xA0;this condition has also come under question as the results of recent&#xA0;studies show.

<strong>Patients continue to have &quot;retained surgical items&quot; - or items including sponges, needles and instruments - left in their bodies following surgery about a dozen times a day, according to the latest studies.&#xA0;</strong>

While there is no federal reporting requirement on these instances, government data suggests it happens between 4,500 and 6,000 times a year in the U.S. alone, with sponges accounting for about 70% of lost surgical items.

Complications for a patient suffering from one of these incidents can last a lifetime. Many patients suffer for years before anyone determines the cause of their pain, at which point infection has more than likely set in, leading to loss of parts of intestines and even death.

Even while these incidents continue to plague the medical community, fewer than 15% of U.S. hospitals have invested in electronic tracking devices for surgical sponges. Sponge-tracking systems typically add $8-$12 to the cost of an operation - a tiny fraction of the average procedure&apos;s price - and would reduce the risk of retained surgical items almost to zero, if used properly.

The Mayo Clinic, which adopted a bar code system for each sponge to be scanned before and after it goes into a patient, has not had a lost sponge case in almost four years. Read the full details here:

<strong>The practice of not failing medical students who excel in the classroom but lack clinical intuition, communication skills and bedside manner necessary to be a good doctor is harming the state of patient care, according to an article in <em>The New York Times</em>.</strong>

In the third year of medical school, students leave the lecture halls and begin to work with patients and other clinicians in specialty-based courses called &quot;clerkships,&quot; where they are evaluated by senior doctors.

The problem lies in the fact that grading systems in these clerkships are subjective and not standardized, leaving faculty with little or no training or support in evaluating students while in the real world of medicine. Over 40 percent of directors of internal medicine clerkship courses in the mid-1990s admitted they had passed students who should have failed their course because they had difficulty distinguishing what a &quot;minimum standard&quot; would be.

&quot;There have to be unified, transparent and objective criteria,&quot; said Dr. Sara B. Fazio, who leads the internal medicine clerkship at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. &quot;We will all be patients one day. We have to think about what kind of doctors we want to have now and in the future.&quot; Read the full details here:

Medical malpractice starts at the training of medical students. What is&#xA0;clear is failing students do not always get failing grades. In the end,&#xA0;this results in failure to diagnose, birth injury, cerebral palsy and&#xA0;wrongful death cases.

<strong>Deadly bacterial infections resistent to even the strongest antibiotics are on the rise in U.S. hospitals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</strong>

The bacteria, normally found in the gut, offers a &quot;limited window of opportuntity&quot; to halt its spread and can cause untreatable illnesses when it invades parts of the body like the bloodstream, lungs or urinary tract. The death rate from bloodstream infections can reach 50 percent.

Forty-two states have had cases of these bacterial infections. About 4 percent of short-stay hospitals reported such infections in the first half of 2012 nationwide, but the rate was much higher - 18 percent - among long-term acute-care hospitals, which treat people who need ventilators for a long time or who have other chronic problems.

The disease centers recommend ruthless scrubbing of all surfaces and relentless handwashing to stop the infections from spreading, but hospitals are also urged to isolate infected patients with dedicated-care teams and equipment. Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="Deadly Bacteria That Resist Strongest Drugs Are Spreading" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/health/deadly-drug-resistant-infections-rise-in-hospitals-report-warns.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Deadly Bacteria That Resist Strongest Drugs Are Spreading</a></strong>

The CDC is becoming increasingly concerned about infections which are not&#xA0;effectively stopped by any currently used antibiotics. An epidemic is&#xA0;possible if these infections spread beyond the walls of nursing homes,&#xA0;hospitals, and other physicians&apos; offices to cause infection that lead to&#xA0;death.

<p><strong>The only real difference between laparoscopic and the heavily-advertised, robotic surgery for hysterectomies may be a major cost increase for the latter, according to a study in The Journal of the American Medical Association.</strong></p>
<p>Laparoscopic surgery, in which narrow instruments and a small video camera are inserted through tiny incisions, costs a median of $6,679. With robotically assisted surgery, the surgeon sits at a console with a 3-dimensional view of the surgical site, and computer technology translates his or her hand movements into precise, scaled movements of the instruments. This procedure costs a median of $8,868, a one-third increase.</p>

<p>While approximately 600,000 American women have hysterectomies each year, many are prescribed for non life-threatening conditions without fully informing women of the long-term harms, including depression and a higher risk of heart disease, according to Nora W.

<strong>An increase in reports of a rare but potentially deadly type of superbug resistant to nearly all antibiotics has prompted stricter precautions in U.S. hospitals, nursing homes and other health care settings.</strong>

People who carry dangerous CRE - Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae - can take more than a year before they test negative for the bacteria, making it more difficult to control and raising the risk or wider spread. Since last July, there have been 15 reports of unusual forms of CRE in the U.S.

The Centers for Disease Control called for stricter isolation and hygiene precautions, increased screening of patients potentially colonized with CRE and better communication within and between hospitals and other health care setting where the bigs can become intractable - and deadly. CRE infections have a mortality rate of up to 40 percent, much higher than other health care infections, such as those caused by MRSA or C. difficile.

&quot;The major concern is that an undiagnosed carrier may be admitted to hospital for totally unrelated reasons, and subsequently and unwittingly pass his CRE to other patients,&quot; said Dr. Amon Yinnon, one of the American Journal of Infection Control study&apos;s authors. Read the full details here:

Infection leading to sepsis and death are ever increasing in the hospital setting. The CDC is now reporting an ever increasing risk of &quot;super bugs&quot; which are resistant to all forms of antibiotics and claim the lives of many who contract it. It is important to know the existence of these strains and avoid the locations where they are commonly found.

<strong>A Mediterranean diet can prevent about 30 percent of heart attacks, strokes and deaths from heart disease in people at high risk, according to a new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine.</strong>

The results of the effects of the diet &#x2013; which is rich in olive oil, nuts, beans, fish, fruits and vegetables, and a glass of wine with meals &#x2013; were so clear that the study ended early as it was deemed unethical to continue.

The researchers were careful to say in their paper that while the diet clearly reduced heart disease for those at high risk for it, more research was needed to establish its benefits for people at low risk. But the expectation is the diet would help people at both high and low risk, and it is suggested that the best way to use it for protection would be to start in childhood.

Until now, evidence that the Mediterranean diet reduced the risk of heart disease was weak, based mostly on studies showing that people from Mediterranean countries seemed to have lower rates of heart disease &#x2014; a pattern that could have been attributed to factors other than diet.

<strong>The quality of care in Kentucky&apos;s nursing homes is severely lacking; two out of every five nursing homes in the state are ranked below or much below average by the United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</strong>

Since 2009, health care citations have listed 1,821 deficiencies directly related to resident rights or care within the state&apos;s facilities, with problems ranging from malnourishment and broken bones to sexual assaults and untreated bedsores. In 2012, Kentucky ranked first in overall federal fines at $2,071,469.

One facility in particular is now the most heavily fined nursing home in U.S. recent history: $500,000 in fines for life-threatening negligence related to resident falls and injuries, even though it touted a specialized fall prevention program.

Despite these facts, nursing home owners and operators are enjoying record profits, most of which is subsidized by the American taxpayer through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Read the full details here:

<strong>Improve care at Kentucky nursing homes</strong>

Unfortunately, nursing home residents are some of the most helpless members of our society, and their abuse and neglect often goes unreported. The corporations that own nursing homes want to increase their profits further at the expense of a resident&#x2019;s right to be compensated if he or she is abused or neglected.

<strong>If you or someone you love has been injured due to nursing home abuse or negligence,&#xA0;call the professionals at Crandall &amp; Pera Law for a free case evaluation.</strong>

<strong>Attaching a patient&apos;s photo to their X-rays can get around the problem of patient mix-ups that, while relatively rare, can lead to dire consequences, according to a recent study.</strong>

While it is estimated that X-ray identification errors occur in 1 out of every 10,000 patients, the fallout could be catastrophic when they do happen.

&quot;The patient could be diagnosed with cancer and then get an operation he shouldn&apos;t have while the patient who should have gotten the cancer diagnosis isn&apos;t getting the surgery,&quot; said Dr. Srini Tridandapani, the author of the study. &quot;So you could be affecting two patients.&quot;

Part of the problem is that doctors don&apos;t expect to get the wrong X-ray and often don&apos;t recognize the mistake when it happens. In the study, 10 radiologists were given 200 pairs of X-rays to read, one pair per patient; they caught only three out of 24 mismatches when no photo was attached but 16 out of 25 errors when photos were included.

The process of implementing photos remains to be seen, though; skeptics believe they may make it take longer to read X-rays or patients might not want photos of themselves included in their medical files. Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="Say &apos;Cheese&apos;: Photos may avert X-ray mix-ups, study finds" href="http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/15/17724368-say-cheese-photos-may-avert-x-ray-mix-ups-study-finds?lite" target="_blank">Say &apos;Cheese&apos;: Photos may avert X-ray mix-ups, study finds</a></strong>

This interesting study suggests a way to avoid patient mix-ups or the wrong patient receiving negligence care due to a radiology study being interpreted for them when it was meant for another patient. bAdvances as simple as taking a photograph of the patient has helped stop medical negligence in this regard.

<strong>A potential decision made by the US Supreme Court on a current case regarding patenting human genes could affect the health and lives of every American.</strong>

Myriad Genetics currently controls the patents on variations of two human genes - BRCA1 and BRCA2 - whose mutations provide a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. With their exclusive rights, all BRCA tests are conducted by Myriad, meaning the company can set its own price free of competition and provides no opportunity for a second opinion. Genetic testing for breast cancer can cost up to $3,500.

Any data gleaned from the test results, such as geographic and demographic patterns, or new genetic variants are also kept by Myriad and not shared publicly. This could prove to be a deterrent to doctors being able to order the sequence of each person&apos;s genome to look for disease-related gene variations, which scientists say will be coming soon.

A Supreme Court decision will not just decide the fate of breast and ovarian cancer research, but healthcare as a whole. Who will conduct your medical tests, how those tests are interpreted, how and how fast drugs can be developed, and what your doctor can tell you about your health are just some of the issues attached to the decision.

&quot;The care available to patients should not be restricted because the naturally occurring building blocks of human biology have been inappropriately patented,&quot; said Dr. Jeremy A. Lazarus, president of the American Medical Association. &quot;Opportunities for scientific research and medical care based on human genes must remain available to all and exclusive to none.&quot; Read the full details here:

The Colorado Medical Board has filed 14 counts of unprofessional conduct against a Denver surgeon for various forms of medical malpractice, according to CBS News.

Dr. Warren Kortz is accused of leaving sponges and surgical equipment in patients as well as improperly using robotic surgery for kidney transplants.

Not only has Kortz misrepresented the success rate of the machine as the &quot;safest, best option,&quot; but he is also accused of not offering standard non-robotic surgical options for his patients.

Manual surgeries were needed after patients suffered nerve damage and internal bleeding from the robot. Kortz is accused of subjecting patients to overly long surgeries, even needing to abort kidney donations because of mistakes, and failing to document these errors in medical charts.

An attorney for Kortz in a negligence suit from one of the kidney patients said the doctor&apos;s care was &quot;reasonable and appropriate&quot; and that he is a &quot;very experienced and excellent surgeon who has helped many Coloradans over his lengthy career.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>Hospitals may have little incentive to improve upon preventable surgical complications and mistakes because of the revenue they receive for longer stays and extra care from insurers, according to a new study published in <em>The Journal of the American Medical Association</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

Surgical complications that could be prevented, like blood clots, pneumonia or infected incisions, will remain high until the insurance payment system is changed to stop rewarding poor care, according to the study&apos;s researchers.

The study&apos;s analysis of over 34,000 surgical patients showed an average $30,500 increase in revenue for patients who required an extended stay as compared to patients without complications ($49,4000 versus $18,900). Private insurers paid far more for complications than did Medicare or Medicaid, or patients who paid out of pocket.

While the researchers are not suggesting hospitals deliberately cause complications to make money, they do point out the fact that the current payment system makes it difficult for hospitals to perform better when improvements can wind up costing them money.

To help reduce complications, insurers should not only quit paying for substandard care, but also should reward excellent care with bonuses. Hospitals should also be required to disclose their complication rates, because patients will shun those with high rates and force them to improve or shut down. Read the full details here:

This study confirms apparent medical negligence by allowing hospitals to profit from various cases of negligence.

<strong>Antibiotic-resistant superbugs dubbed &quot;nightmare bacteria&quot; by federal health officials have been found present in about 40 patients since July at a transitional-care hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.&#xA0;</strong>

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE for short, are a family of superbugs that strike hospitalized patients and kill as many as half who get bloodstream infections.&#xA0;Hospitals can wind up with CRE cases if they are present in the patient upon admission, bacteria that have been sensitive to antibiotics become resistant, or if CRE is transmitted from patient to patient.

The investigation by the Kentucky Department for Public Health into the presence of superbugs at Kindred Hospital Louisville, a facility where patients often stay for weeks, has not attributed any deaths to CRE in Kindred patients so far. The presence of CRE in bodily fluids could mean the patient is &quot;colonized&quot; by the bacteria without developing an infection. Read the full details here:

<strong>Kindred had 40 CRE cases</strong>

Often times infections occur in nursing home residents through nobody&apos;s fault. However, if your loved one contracts a deadly bacteria while convalescing at a nursing home, you should investigate whether the facility&apos;s infection rate is unacceptably high due to poor sanitary conditions.

<strong>With hospital re-admissions costing the health care system more than $15 billion a year, a health coaching experiment in southern Ohio is aiming to lower the rate of returns by visiting patients at home.</strong>

The Care Transitions program, managed by the Council on Aging of Southwest Ohio, visits patients in their daily environment for the first few weeks after they are discharged from the hospital, helping to organize medicines, prepare healthy meals and find transportation to a doctor&apos;s appointment. By being able to complete these tasks, patients will theoretically be less likely to need another trip to the hospital.

Since the program began in mid-2012, only 8.6% of about 900 Medicare patients in the program have been readmitted to five area hospitals within 30 days. Meanwhile, Medicare patients not involved in the program were readmitted at a rate of 21.3% to the same hospitals.

Medicare estimates up to $12 billion could be prevented with better follow-up care for patients.

&quot;There&apos;s only so much the hospital can do,&quot; said Kim Clark, the program&apos;s manager at the Council on Aging. &quot;The goal is to coach them so they understand, &apos;What do I need to do when I&apos;m by myself?&apos;&quot; Read the full story here:

<strong>IN-DEPTH: Helping patients at home keeps them out of hospital</strong>

An uninformed patient is one of the most prevalent causes of medical malpractice nationwide. Through increased education and investing time and thoughtful care into each and every patient, hopefully hospitals will be able to decrease the rate at which medical mistakes are currently made.

<strong>While health officials advise abstinence, an occasional, small amount of alcohol during pregnancy may have zero effect on a child&apos;s development, according to a recent study published in BJOG, an international obstetrics and gynecology journal.&#xA0;</strong>

<strong>Medical mistakes that affect hundreds of thousands of patients in the U.S. every year are typically kept quiet by hospitals, but Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital in Boston is instead airing its mistakes in a monthly newsletter for its 16,000 employees.&#xA0;</strong>

Many hospitals rarely provide details of medical errors in fear of sparking lawsuits and scaring off patients, but this reluctance to candidly discuss with the entire staff how medical mistakes harmed patients also hampers wide discussion of how mistakes happen and can be prevented.

Brigham leaders are using the online newsletter to encourage staff to talk openly about their mistakes and propose solutions, helping to make sure those errors are not repeated.

Most issues tell a story of medical care gone awry through interviews with caregivers and often with patients, and describe the hospital&apos;s response.&#xA0;Patients are not named to protect their privacy and caregivers are posted anonymously so as not to discourage them from reporting problems.

&quot;Other institutions are putting data out there but we are pushing the envelope with our story-telling,&quot; said Dr. Allen Kachalia, associate chief quality officer. &quot;Many patients have just been surprised that we&apos;ve been asking them their side of the story.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>In order to make the most of your annual physical exam, you should be spending more time having a conversation with your doctor in order to build a relationship rather than just having your body examined.</strong>

Dr. Richard Besser, M.D., who spent 18 years at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, offers the top five questions to ask your doctor at your next appointment:
<ol>
    <li><em>What is a BMI and what is mine? </em>Body mass index tells you how appropriate your weight is for your height and can tell you whether you are at increased risk for many disorders, including diabetes and heart disease.</li>
    <li><em>Which screening tests do I truly need?</em>&#xA0;Recommendations on screening have changed a lot. Talk about what is recommended for you and decide what you need.</li>
    <li><em>Do I need any shots?</em>&#xA0;There are 14 vaccinations that are recommended for some adults. If you don&apos;t ask the question, many doctors will forget to review what you&apos;ve had and what you need. Why put yourself at risk for an illness that can be prevented?</li>
    <li><em>Is there anything in my family history I should be worried about? </em>First thing to do is ask your doctor to help you compile a detailed family history. Then once you have that information, go over it and look for clues that might put your health at risk.</li>
    <li><em>If I change one lifestyle habit, what should it be?</em>&#xA0;The key to good health lies in healthy behaviors. Look to your doctor for advice on how to exercise more, eat better, stop smoking, get some sleep and control your stress levels.</li>

<strong>Tort reform measures to reduce &quot;defensive medicine&quot; that will, in turn, increase the risk of birth injuries nationwide persist even after a recent report by the non-partisan Commonwealth Fund ranks the costly U.S. health system dead last on patient safety.</strong>

Instead of instituting national policies that promote quality improvement, as the Commonwealth Fund suggests, the U.S. healthcare system continues to pass initiatives to allow doctors to do fewer tests in order to save costs, regardless of how many more lives are lost due to undiagnosed conditions.

Less testing is of particular concern when it comes to babies suffering from birth injuries, especially the form of brain damage caused by extreme jaundice known as kenicterus. An entirely preventable birth injury, kernicterus is caused by too high levels of bilirubin (yellow pigment &#xA0;created during the recycling of old blood cells) in the body.

Many health care providers fail to test bilirubin levels in the 60 percent of babies estimated to display symptoms of jaundice by the Centers for Disease Control. Many times the immediate measures needed to bring down the levels before brain damage occurs are not implemented, and measures that lead to less testing will only increase the number of babies who will suffer from this devastating birth injury nationwide. Read the full details here:

<strong>Tort Reform Measures Increase Risk of Birth Injuries Such as Kernicterus</strong>

<strong>Emergency rooms have largely been blamed for excessive health care costs, but popular cost-cutting measures may be doing more harm than good for patient care, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</strong>

Reducing ER visits for non-urgent care, which can cost up to five times more than care provided in a doctor&apos;s office, is a measure adopted by many hospitals. Several states proposed a policy to pay the bills for true emergencies, like a heart attack or ruptured aneurysm, but reduce or deny reimbursements for less serious cases like heartburn or constipation.

The problem with this method, according to the study, is the assumption that patients can predict the urgency of their diagnosis themselves based on initial symptoms. By reviewing nationwide records of nearly 35,000 ER visits, researchers found that nearly 90 percent of urgent cases presented the same primary symptoms, including abdominal discomfort, chest pain and fever, as the 6 percent of cases that were discharged and could have been treated in a doctor&apos;s office.

The state of Washington has instituted a different policy. By establishing programs designed to educate patients on how to access care and other statewide guidelines, as well as creating regularly updated reports on how emergency department resources are utilized, the state&apos;s policy has resulted in projected savings of over $31 million by the end of the fiscal year.

&quot;A policy that requires more coordination and more tailoring means more work than one that slashes benefits across the board,&quot; said Dr. Renee Y. Hsia, senior author of the study. &quot;But it is the right thing to do for patients.&quot; Read the full details here:

Services and staffing at emergency rooms throughout the country have been steadily cut over the last decade. This has led to increased wait times, poor medical care and numerous patients who are ignored or sent home despite having illnesses deserving of admission to the hospital.

A new study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic might prove a surprising new explanation of why red meat may contribute to heart disease.

Researchers believe a little-studied chemical that is burped out by bacteria in the stomach is the real culprit in the increased amount of heart disease seen in red-meat eaters, as opposed to long-held suspected factors, such as saturated fat and cholesterol, which may only be minor contributors.

The bacteria is quickly converted by the liver into TMAO, another little-studied chemical, that gets into the blood and whose levels turned out to predict heart attack risk in humans.

The study could lead to new treatments for heart disease and a new way to assess heart disease risk by looking for TMAO in the blood. While researchers do not believe it is best to avoid red meat entirely due to its essential protein and B vitamins, they do stress it would be much better in moderation. Read the full story here:

Misdiagnoses occur most often during examinations when doctors have trouble getting a complete medical history from the patient and the failure of doctors to follow up and track tests and referrals. In order to reduce these medical errors, more doctors and hospitals need to engage the patient in their own health care and improve their access to physicians, according to Hardeep Singh, the study&apos;s lead author.

&quot;If we do it together with patients, providers and health care systems, we will have a much deeper impact of understanding and improving this problem,&quot; says Singh.

The most common misdiagnoses among 190 errors in primary care visits between October 2006 and September 2007 at a large urban Veterans Affair facility were pneumonia (6.7%), heart failure (5.7%), kidney failure (5.3%), cancer (5.3%) and urinary tract infections (4.8%). Read the full details here:

Missed diagnoses of pneumonia and heart failure is a common problem in U.S. hospitals and leads to wrongful death, increased hospital bills and often severe permanent damages.

<strong>Medication errors in hospitals that are both common and potentially fatal can be easily and substantially reduced according to a study published in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</em>.</strong>

By prescribing medications through computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems medical professionals could decrease the likelihood of error on that order by 48 percent, leading to an estimated 17.4 million medication errors averted in the U.S. each year.

CPOE systems allow medication orders to be communicated over a computer network and, in turn, decreasing the risk of human errors including delays in order completion, handwriting or transcription errors, and the ordering of duplicate or incorrect doses or tests.

Despite the systems&apos; effectiveness at preventing medication errors, adoption and use in U.S. hospitals remains modest. Read the full details here:

<strong>Depakote, a drug used to treat seizures, bipolar disorder and migraine headaches, could cause lasting negative effects when used while pregnant, recent studies suggest.&#xA0;</strong>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings about the use of Depakote while pregnant, which has reported risks of decreased IQ and a risk of autism for the child exposed to the drug while in the womb. Repetitive behaviors, communication problems and social behavior issues may also be effects that last well into childhood.

While these findings are reportedly dose dependent, a woman may have no choice but to run the risk of Depakote birth defects if she does not tolerate other anti-convulsant medications. Read the full details here:

<strong>A bill that would adjust speed limits from 65 mph to 70 mph on most portions of interstates in Ohio is in the works after being passed by the Senate.</strong>

The bill, which was sent back to committee by the House, would impact both citizens and commercial drivers and is getting mixed reactions by Ohio&apos;s population.

&quot;The reason we added this was because there are 35 other states already doing it,&quot; said Sen. Gayle Manning, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. &quot;Our roads and cars are safer than ever. This increase is just going to help save people time.&quot;

States surrounding Ohio that have a speed limit of 70 mph are West Virginia, Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana.

&quot;We would need to research that issue in great detail to make any sort of conclusion on if the increase in speed is more dangerous,&quot; said Lt. Anne Ralston, spokeswoman for the Ohio State Highway Patrol. &quot;Regardless our goal is to enforce the laws with professionalism and fairness, which we will continue to do regardless of what the speed limit is.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>Nearly 70 percent of nurses polled in a recent survey admitted that fatigue had made them concerned about their ability to perform during work hours.</strong>

An online survey sent to the HealthLeaders Media Council also showed that more than 27 percent of these health care professionals said they had made an error resulting from fatigue, while nearly 65 percent said they had come close.

Much of the blame for exhausting work schedules could be placed on manual scheduling processes that lack visibility into the larger staff scheduling picture and offer alerts to compliance with staffing policies or regulatory requirements.

Nearly 40 percent of survey respondents also cited inadequate staffing levels as a concern, as the local vacancy rate for registered nurse positions is more than double the rate of unfilled vacancies seen in 2008. Read the full details here:

There has been a shortage of nurses throughout the country for many years, a situation which has led to understaffing and the hiring of many nurses who were poorly or quickly trained to fill this void. An increase in nursing malpractice and medication errors, as well as poor communication to physicians has occurred as a result of these issues.

<strong>A bill that will exempt many commercial vehicles from federal safety rules passed a Kentucky Senate Committee recently with one police-mandated change.</strong>

After Louisville Metro Police officials raised concerns that House Bill 125 would risk leaving unsafe trucks on the roads, the bill was amended to allow police to conduct random safety inspections. A provision that assumes a commercial truck driver to be drunk with a blood alcohol content of 0.04 - half the blood alcohol of most drivers - will be kept in place.

While the bill as originally presented would have allowed police to cite trucks for safety violations, it would not have allowed them to stop the trucks to look for problems.

Drivers of commercial trucks weighing between 10,001 and 26,000 pounds that are not crossing state lines will no longer have to keep daily driving logs or a medical card proving they are healthy enough to drive a truck due to the new bill. These vehicles can range from a pickup with a large trailer to a 24-foot box truck. Read the full details here:

<strong>Compromise truck bill passes Kentucky Senate panel</strong>

Exempting commercial trucks from portions of Federal Regulations is a dangerous idea. Commercial truck accident deaths rose by 8.7% from 2009 to 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, and it has been proven that regulations may be ignored when drivers are looking to shorten their time on the road.&#xA0;Thankfully the police in Kentucky questioned the logic of this attempted legislation, which likely would have led to more commercial trucking accidents in that state.

<strong>The U.S. has the highest first-day death rate in the industrialized world, worse than 68 other countries, and the highest teenage birth rate of any industrialized country, according to a report released by Save the Children.&#xA0;</strong>

An estimated 11,300 American newborns die every year on the same day they were born - amounting to 50 percent more first-day deaths than all other industrialized countries <em>combined</em> - even though most of them could be saved with fairly cheap interventions.

Four products costing between 13 cents and $6 each - simple bag-and-mask devices to help babies breathe, the antiseptic chlorhexidine to prevent umbilical cord infections, antibiotics to treat infections, and steroid injections to delay preterm labor - could save one million newborns a year, according to the report.

&quot;Teenage mothers in the U.S. tend to be poorer, less educated, and receive less prenatal care than older mothers,&quot; the report says. &quot;Because of these challenges, babies born to teen mothers are more likely to be low-birthweight and be born prematurely and die in their first month. They are also more likely to suffer chronic medical conditions, do poorly in school, and give birth during their teen years.&quot;

High-quality care before, during and after pregnancy and access to the appropriate level of care at the time of delivery can also result in healthier moms giving birth to healthier babies. Home visits by nurses or community health workers are common in Europe, but very unusual in the United States. Read the full story here:

<strong>Pregnant woman are warned not to use the migraine drug valproate sodium as it could result in lower IQ scores in their child, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</strong>

The results of a recent study showed that children exposed to valproate products in the womb had a lower IQ at the age of six than children who were exposed to other antiepileptics.

Drugs containing valproate are used to prevent migraine headaches, treat epileptic seizures and manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Drugs containing valproate already carry a boxed warning for birth defects.

&quot;Valproate medications should never be used in pregnant women for the prevention of migraine headaches because we have even more data now that shows the risks to the children outweigh any treatment benefits for this use,&quot; said Russell Katz, the FDA&apos;s Director of the Division of Neurology Products.

Though Depakote and other drugs containing valproate already come with warnings of possible birth defects, this study is further evidence that no woman should take any medicine containing valproate during pregnancy.

<strong>Some intelligence and behavioral problems in young children may actually be caused by controversial fire retardant chemicals used in products that are supposed to protect kids, according to a new study presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meeting.&#xA0;&#xA0;</strong>

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have mostly not been used in items like baby strollers, carpets and electronics in the U.S. since 2004 because of known health risks. However, since PBDEs are not very biodegradable, they may still exist in older products that people may have or continue to exist in the tissue of people who were exposed to the chemicals.

Prenatal exposure to PBDEs was associated to lower cognitive abilities at 5 and increased hyperactivity from 2 through 5 years old in the sample of 309 pregnant women and their children.

Each 10-fold increase in maternal exposure to the chemicals was linked to a four-point decrease in IQ scores which, while it might not seem like much in an individual, could have a big impact on the social interactions and overall economic stability if an entire population experiences this decrease.

&quot;To reduce PDBEs in pregnant women, hand washing to reduce dust ingestion is important,&quot; said Dr. Aimin Chen, assistant professor in the Department of Environmental health at University of Cincinnati College of&#xA0;Medicine. &quot;Also reducing PBDEs in the indoor environment may help, such as replacing carpet padding or polyurethane foams that contain PBDEs.&quot; Read the full story here:

PBDEs have been known to pose risks since before 2004. Even though they are no longer sold for most products, pregnant women and mothers need to be careful when using products that were sold before 2004.

The FDA&apos;s 40-year review over whether triclosan is safe was supposed to be released in 2012, but the release is now planned for later this year. Until this review is finalized, companies are permitted to use the chemical in their products.

<strong>Technology is rapidly changing the medical industry as doctors are beginning to make remote visits to patients in ICUs and other facilities via robots run by PCs or iPads, according to a recent article in <em>USA Today</em>.</strong>

These technological overhauls are being used to address shortages of staff and improvements to the level of service for patients, especially for hospitals farther away from experts.

The latest robots, dubbed RP-VITA, can either roam about on their own or be navigated remotely by doctors, guided by sensors and software that maps locations to avoid collisions. Doctors appear on the robot&apos;s screen much like a video chat and use front-facing lenses to zero in on their patients.

The FDA cleared the RP-VITA in January for use in patient monitoring, including cardiovascular, neurological, prenatal, psychological and critical care assessments and examinations. Read the full story here:

<strong>The American Urological Association has reversed its stance on PSA testing for prostate cancer, no longer recommending routine testing for men due to harmful side effects.&#xA0;</strong>

Men under 55 should not get routinely screened with a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test, and men over 80 are not recommended to get screened at all if they have a life expectancy less than 10 to 15 years, according to the AUA. Men who are between the ages of 55 and 69 may benefit most from the test, and should discuss the risks and benefits of the test with their doctor to decide if it is right for them.

The AUA stated to be &quot;outraged&quot; at this same recommendation one year ago, but have reversed course based on data that shows the mortality benefits of preventing prostate cancer with a PSA test for men ages 55 to 69 amounted to one male life spared for every 1,000 men screened over a decade.

Existing studies suggest that a diagnosis may do more harm than good because the test may pick up a tumor that is growing too slowly to pose a serious health threat while biopsies, surgeries and radiation can lead to urinary incontinence, impotence or other fatal complications. Read the full story here:

This is a difficult issue, but the American Urological Association seems to have taken the controversial position that ignorance is bliss for men with tumors that are so slow growing they do not pose imminent risk.

<strong>The most common cause of paid claims for malpractice at 28.6 percent is making errors in diagnosis, not overdoses or even surgical mistakes, according to a recent study.</strong>

More than 100,000 payments for diagnostic error occurred from 1986 to 2010, with these errors accounting for 33.8 percent of the disabilities and almost 40 percent of the deaths that resulted in malpractice payments.

Errors related to treatment and surgery were second and third most common, and all other errors combined - obstetric, medication, monitoring, anesthesia and the rest - accounted for only 20 percent of malpractice payments.

&quot;At the policy level, there is no institute that views it as their problem,&quot; said Dr. David E. Newman-Toker, an associate professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins, who believes physicians, hospitals and insurers all need to contribute to fix this widespread and devastating problem.

&quot;There&apos;s a lot of room for improvement,&quot; he continued. &quot;You can&apos;t get the treatment right if you don&apos;t get the diagnosis right.&quot; Read the full story here:

Studies continue to confirm that more patients are harmed by doctors failing to properly diagnose their ailments than by any other mistake. This is why it is so important for doctors to follow the rules of differential diagnoses and take steps to rule out the most urgent life-threatening dangers, rather than making assumptions about what they believe to be the proper diagnosis.

<strong>Serious medical errors known as &quot;never events&quot; should <em>never</em> occur with proper vigilance by medical staff and surgeons, but even the most egregious errors - including operating on the wrong side of a brain - still happen more often than you might think.</strong>

In 2010, the Journal of Neurosurgery identified 35 documented cases of wrong-side craniotomies from 1996 to 2009 in the United States, but this figure does not include the additional cases that were settled and never brought to the attention of state medical licensing boards, courts and news organizations.

&quot;Wrong-site surgery is such an egregious system failure,&quot; said Charles Kenney, the author of <em>Transforming Health Care</em>. &quot;It&apos;s so devastating, not only to the patient and the patient&apos;s family, but also to the caregiving team because they have made about the worst mistake that they can make.&quot;

Many organizations have adopted so-called &quot;mistake-proofing&quot; protocols and checklists to prevent such errors as wrong-site, and even wrong-person, surgeries. These systems generally include indelible marking of the operative site and verification with medical records, as well as a &quot;timeout&quot; to be held in which the surgeon explains the details of the operation and permits all members of the team to ask questions and raise any concerns or objections.

&quot;The typical reaction in these cases is to assign blame,&quot; said Kenney. &quot;When that leads down the path to an individual, that&apos;s wrong. These events are systems or process breakdowns.&quot; Read the full story here:

It is frightening that surgeries continue to be performed on the wrong side of patients&#x2019; bodies.&#xA0; When the proper protocols are not put in place, or they aren&#x2019;t followed, patient safety is thrown out the window and tragedies result.

<strong>People who have had common skin cancers, even those not typically treated with radiation or chemotherapy, may be at an increased risk of getting cancer again in their life, according to a new study.</strong>

The included more than 150,000 people who were followed for more than 20 years and found that women with nonmelanoma skin cancers were 26 percent more likely to later develop another form of cancer, including lung and breast cancer, compared with women who didn&apos;t have these skin cancers. In men, the risk increased by 15 percent.

&#xA0;

&#xA0;

A 2006 study showed there were 2.1 million cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer in the U.S.

The reason for the general increased risk of other cancers is unclear, although some researchers suspect that the cellular machinery involved in DNA repair may not work as well in some people. Read the full article here:

The risk of developing other cancers later in life increases if one is previously diagnosed with skin cancer. This is a frightening conclusion with the incidence of skin cancer increasing so quickly.

<strong>Americans underestimate their chances of needing long-term care, with two-thirds of people over 40 having done little to no planning, according to a new poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.&#xA0;</strong>

Government figures show nearly 7 in 10 Americans will need long-term care - three years, on average - at some point after they reach 65, whether it&apos;s from a relative, a home heath aide, assisted living or a nursing home.

Although most people expect family to step up if they need long-term care, 6 in 10 of those polled haven&apos;t even talked with loved ones about the possibility and how they&apos;d like it to work.

&quot;The expectation that your family is going to be there when you need them often doesn&apos;t mean they understand the full extent of what the job of caregiving will be,&quot; said Susan Reinhard, a nurse who directs AARP&apos;s Public Policy Institute.

Nearly 60 percent of those surveyed also underestimated the cost of a nursing home, which averages more than $6,700 a month. Medicare does not pay for the most common types of long-term care, but 37 percent of those surveyed mistakenly think it will pay for a nursing home and even more expect it to cover a home health aide when that is only approved under certain conditions. Read the full story here:

As with medical malpractice, nobody ever expects that they will be the one who ends up needing long-term care. As a result, few people are appropriately planning for this possibility.

<strong>Drug overdoses continue to increase at record-high rates throughout the state of Ohio, causing about one Ohioan to die every five hours in 2011, according to figures released by the state Department of Health.&#xA0;</strong>

Prescription painkillers and a worsening heroin problem have caused accidental overdoses to jump 14 percent to 1,765 from 2010 statewide. Such overdoses remain the leading cause of accidental deaths in the state, ahead of car crashes and falls, a trend that began in 2007.

These dire statistics come at a time when Ohio has launched numerous efforts to crack down on illegal prescription painkiller use and distribution. Midway through 2011, Ohio enacted a law meant to reduce the number &#xA0;of pills-on-demand clinics, while changes in Medicaid rules are making it easier for doctors to prescribe medication that helps addicts beat the craving for drugs like heroin and painkillers.

&quot;It&apos;s like when we put more cars on the road, we&apos;re going to see more car crashes,&quot; said Christy Beeghly, the Health Department&apos;s Violence and Injury Prevention Program administrator. &quot;So we put more pills out there, we have more addiction and ultimately more overdoses.&quot; Read the full details here:

Ohio sees record-high overdose deaths in 2011

&#xA0;

An average of five Ohioans die every day from drug overdoses, more than any other type of accidental death. This demonstrates the significant danger that exists when doctors don&#x2019;t hesitate to prescribe narcotics.

<strong>Congenital heart problems cause abnormal heartbeats that, even in their most manageable forms, can turn into a crisis once a woman becomes pregnant.</strong>

It is especially important for women born with congenital heart problems to discuss them with a cardiologist before becoming pregnant, even if they have had no problems since learning of a murmur early in life, because of the survival risks involved for both mother and baby.

&quot;A lot of patients believe since they are feeling well that they are cured of their heart disease,&quot; said Dr. Curt Daniels, director of the adolescent and adult congenital heart disease program at Ohio State. &quot;If you had heart surgery as a child, the majority are not cured.&quot;

The chances of being born with a heart defect are 0.8 in 1,000, making it the most common birth defect. The most common heart defects are ventricular septal defects (holes in the heart) and bicuspid aortic valves, in which there are two sections rather than the normal three.

Adults with congenital heart problems should be in the regular care of specialists, even if they had undergone surgery as a child, Daniels said. Read the full story here:

The stress of pregnancy can turn an otherwise stable heart defect into a crisis. Any woman with a known heart defect should get a full cardiac work-up before getting pregnant.

<strong>Progressively limiting the number of hours that medical residents can work, in response to public concerns about errors arising from fatigue, may be causing more problems than the system was designed to address.</strong>

The latest mandate (2011) by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education allows medical interns to work no longer than 16 hours in a day. Residency programs that violate the restriction risk losing their accreditation.

But this limit on hours does not lower the workload of medical professionals at the same time; instead, interns are faced with covering the same amount of work as before in fewer hours. In response, some hospitals have adopted a &quot;night float&quot; system that means a resident just a year out of internship has to carry the work of as many as 12 interns at night, looking after more than 100 patients.

Contrary to expectations, studies have shown that interns have not been getting significantly more sleep and are also not happier nor are they studying more. Interns are spending less time in educational activities because the additional time required for such conferences and lectures would push them over the 16-hour limit.

&quot;You can&apos;t keep asking these young doctors to do more and more work in less time without affecting patient care,&quot; said Dr. Lara Gotein, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center in Santa Fe, N.M. &quot;Until we address the problem of overwork, we&apos;re just playing a shell game.&quot; Read the full article here:

Surprisingly, not permitting residents to work more than 16 hours in any given day is not improving patient safety and is not improving residents&#x2019; quality of life.

<strong>An apology or other sympathetic statement made by a healthcare official to a patient cannot be used as evidence of liability in medical malpractice cases, the Supreme Court of Ohio recently clarified.&#xA0;</strong>

This information cannot be used in cases filed after the &quot;medical apology statute&quot; legislation took effect in 2004, even if the treatment occurred before then or the doctor admits full responsibility.

&quot;Physicians are and should be sympathetic and empathetic,&quot; argued Dr. William Wulf, medical director of Central Ohio Primary Care. &quot;Fear of future legal action shouldn&apos;t impede that.&quot; Read the full details here:

The rules of evidence in both state and federal courts have always allowed admissions of fault to be introduced as evidence at trial. Now there is one exception and it is <em>only</em> for doctors in Ohio. The Ohio Supreme Court has extended a statute that did not allow apologies - which may or may not be admissions of fault - to be used as evidence to now also excluding admissions of fault by doctors.

<strong>&quot;False positive&quot; results on mammogram screenings can cause women to adapt a psychological well-being more closely matched to that of breast cancer patients than healthy women, according to a new Danish study.&#xA0;</strong>

Of the more than 1,300 women studied, those who received false alarms reported symptoms of anxiety and depression that still lingered three years later, long after a cancer diagnosis had been ruled out.

&quot;It is comparable to a life crisis, like getting divorced or the death of a close family member,&quot; Dr. John Brodersen, the study&apos;s author, said of mammogram false positives. &quot;People don&apos;t trust their body anymore; they interpret their body systems differently....These women are turned from healthy people to people [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][at] risk, to people who are close to being sick.&quot;

While an x-ray of the breast is often to the first step in diagnosing breast cancer, it can also lead to unnecessary tests and procedures, such as biopsies and lumpectomies, not to mention stress. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends women between the ages of 50 and 74 to get a mammogram every two years. Read the full details here:

For every one women saved by cancer screening, 200 women are incorrectly told they have an abnormal finding and ten unnecessary surgeries are performed. The psychological toll is steep.

<strong>While surgical mistakes and drug overdoses are common forms of medical malpractice that grab headlines, it is actually diagnosis errors that account for the most severe patient harm and the largest share of malpractice payouts.&#xA0;</strong>

Errors are made whenever a diagnosis is missed, wrong, or delayed, as detected by some subsequent definitive test or finding. Severe harm can result from delay or failure to treat a condition, or from treatment for a condition a patient did not actually have.

Diagnostic error-related malpractice payments amounted to $38.8 billion&#xA0;between 1986 and 2010, according to researchers, with an estimated 80,000 to 160,000 patients suffering misdiagnosis-related, potentially preventable, significant permanent injury or death every year in the U.S.

&quot;Diagnostic errors have been underappreciated and under-recognized because they&apos;re difficult to measure and keep track of owning to the frequent gap between the time the error occurs and when it&apos;s detected,&quot; said David E. Newman-Toker, associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. &quot;These are frequent problems that have played second fiddle to medical and surgical errors, which are evident more immediately.&quot; Read the full details here:

80,000 to 160,000 people suffer permanent injury or death because they are improperly diagnosed, but these numbers do not even account for those who are misdiagnosed and do not suffer severe injury. Altogether, it could be as many as 15% of all patients affected by bad diagnoses. Not surprisingly, misdiagnoses accounts for most malpractice payouts.

<strong>A recent study in Sweden has created further evidence that antidepressant use during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorders in children.&#xA0;</strong>

The study controlled for other variables like family income, parent educational level, and maternal and paternal age that have not been previously associated with autism. This is the second study in two years to associate antidepressant use during pregnancy with an increased incidence of autism in exposed children.

While the study did not exclude the possibility that severe depression, rather than antidepressants, created the association, the authors did urge patients to seek other treatments besides selective&#xA0;serotonin&#xA0;reuptake&#xA0;inhibitors (S.S.R.I.&apos;s) and&#xA0;tricyclicantidepressants.

&quot;Informed decisions would also need to consider weighting the wider risks of untreated depression with the other adverse outcomes related to antidepressant use,&quot; the study states. &quot;With the current evidence, if the potential risk of autism were a consideration in the decision-making process, it may be reasonable to think about, wherever&#xA0;appropriate,&#xA0;nondrugapproaches&#xA0;such as psychological treatments.&quot; Read the full <a title="details here:Study Links Autism With Antidepressant Use During Pregnancy" href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/study-links-autism-with-antidepressant-use-during-pregnancy/" target="_blank">details here:</a>

<strong>Caffeine use and withdrawal can cause headaches, heart arrhythmias and increased blood pressure in children and teenagers, according to a study published in the journal <em>Pediatrics in Review</em>.</strong>

Younger people have a lower tolerance for caffeine and could experience ill effects sooner than adults typically would, even with lower amounts of the substance. Doses of caffeine as small as 80 to 100 milligrams can cause withdrawal symptoms when it is cut off.

&quot;A couple sodas a day is even too much for the average kid,&quot; said Dr. Ebo Kwabena Blankson, the pediatrician author of the story.

Products like energy drinks are especially dangerous for children as they are estimated to contain 200 to 250 milligrams of caffeine with unlisted additives. Not surprisingly, most life-threatening conditions resulting from &quot;caffeine toxicities&quot; occur when teenagers mix energy drinks with alcohol.

&quot;What alcohol does is accelerate the effects of caffeine and block the awareness of alcohol,&quot; said Dr. Kanny Grewal, a cardiologist at OhioHealth. &quot;And that leads to more abuse.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>Human behavior may be at least as important as technological innovation when it comes to controlling C. difficile bacteria contamination of hospital rooms, a leading cause of deadly infections.&#xA0;</strong>

Over nearly two years at Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, researchers imposed three cleaning techniques to nearly eliminate the microbe: fluorescent markers whose disappearance after cleaning provided feedback on thoroughness, an ultraviolet radiation device to enhance regular cleaning, and a daily disinfection team requiring assessment and clearance of disinfected rooms by supervisory staff.

Before these procedures were put in place, 67 percent of rooms produce positive cultures for C. difficile. Use of fluorescent markers reduced it to 57 percent; automated UV radiation cut it to 35 percent; and imposing the supervised assessment and clearance made it so only 7 percent of rooms had positive cultures.

<strong>The reason traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are often overlooked is because the victim may continue to look and speak normally and not realize they have suffered an injury at all, delaying necessary care, according to a recent article in <em>The Legal Examiner.&#xA0;</em></strong>

These injuries can occur as a result of car crashes, slip and falls, or other severe impacts, but it is important to remember that they can also result without the head striking anything at all. When the neck is whipped back and forth, the brain could be striking the skull repeatedly, causing a traumatic injury from such force.

Dangerous symptoms can develop from sudden brain impact such as decreased cognition, change in mental state, or altered personality. The victim may also experience communication and language changes and/or brain epilepsy. Many never fully recover from brain injuries, but with quick treatment and proper rehabilitation, victims can live a full and active life. Read the full details here:

<strong>Nearly one in five older patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans were prescribed at least one high-risk medication even though many of the drugs had safer substitutions, a study in <em>The Journal of General Internal Medicine</em> shows.&#xA0;</strong>

These drugs are found in a list of 110 drugs provided by health authorities to doctors giving to the elderly because their side effect risks are magnified. Included in the list are anti-anxiety medications like Valium that can lead to prolonged sedation, and in turn potentially deadly falls and fractures, as well as addiction.

The study found that as socioeconomic status grew lower, the likelihood of being prescribed a high-risk drug increased. Compared with people 65 and odler living in New England, those living in the southern region from Texas to South Carolina were about 12 percent more likely to be prescribed a high-risk medication.

The simultaneous use of multiple medications, a phenomenon known as polypharmacy, is a growing problem among people over 65, who take at least four prescription drugs on average. Adverse effects brough on by the combination of multiple drugs are thought to be responsible for nearly a third of all hospital admissions.

&quot;Polypharmacy is a major public health problem,&quot; said Dr. Amal Trivedi, one of the study&apos;s authors. &quot;Sometimes less is more, particularly for the elderly.&quot; Read the full details here:

&#xA0;

Nursing home negligence and neglect of the elderly occurs routinely in nursing homes and hospitals throughout the US. Elderly and nursing home patients are negligently prescribed risky drugs in an effort to make them calm and easier to care for, making staffing at these institutions easier.

<strong>The stakes over the long-simmering debate in Kentucky over &quot;collaborative agreements&quot; regarding prescription writing may be rising over details of the Affordable Care Act, according to a recent article in <em>The Courier-Journal</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

Under state law, nurse practitioners (NPs) can only write prescriptions if they have a collaborative agreement with a doctor who will vouch for him or her. NPs argue they have the expertise to independently&#xA0;prescribe non-scheduled drugs such and blood pressure and cholesterol medications, but doctors defend the agreements as essential for patient safety.

There are concerns that the Affordable Care Act will heighten doctor shortages and increase the need for NPs, especially in rural areas. Kentucky currently has more than 10,000 physicians and 3,000 advanced practiced registered nurses, a group that includes NPs.

A state work group is evaluating the impact of the Affordable Care Act on Kentucky&apos;s health workforce and recommendations that NPs be allowed to prescribe non-scheduled drugs without a collaborative agreement. Read the full details here:

<strong>Nurse practitioners vs. doctors - Obamacare raises debate</strong>

Unfortunately, our society is faced with the difficult decision of what is more important: quantity or quality. &#xA0;In order for more people to have access to basic care, less educated providers will be required to give that care. Our medical care system is undergoing dramatic changes.

About 9 percent of adolescents have ADHD, displaying hyperactive, impulsive and behavioral problems, and the average age of diagnosis is 7, according to the American Psychiatric Association.

Using an electroencephalogram, or EEG, the test measures combinations of theta and beta brain waves that tend to be more prevalent in children with ADHD The results showed that, with the Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based Assessment Aid, doctors would be able to make a more accurate diagnosis than using traditional methods like behavioral questionnaires and I.Q. testing alone, according to the FDA Read the full details here:

<strong>Complaints about abuse and neglect in Ohio nursing homes have nearly doubled in the last year, according to Attorney General Mike Dewine&apos;s office.</strong>

Dewine&apos;s Medical Fraud Control Unit has opened 131 cases so far in 2013, compared with 74 in the same period last year. This includes 63 new cases in the month of June alone, according to <em>The Columbus Dispatch</em>.

<strong>A recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court prohibits makers of generic drugs from being sued by patients who experience negative side effects, despite the severity of their injuries.&#xA0;</strong>

In overturning a $21 million judgment against Mutual Pharmaceutical, Supreme Court held that generic drug makers cannot be held liable for adverse side effects as long as the warning labels are identical to the drug&apos;s brand-name counterpart.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates that about three-quarters of prescriptions are for generic drugs, which are cheaper than their brand-name equivalents. Millions of Americans do not have the option to take brand-name drugs since insurance companies dictate what doctors prescribe.

It can sometimes take years after the drugs become available for their side effects to surface, and if the brand-name equivalent is no longer on the market, these generic drug makers do not have to update their labels. Read the full details here:

The FDA needs to recognize that generic drug manufacturers have the same obligation as brand-name companies to be held accountable if they do not provide doctors and patients with updated safety information.

<strong>Computed tomography (CT) scans contain 60 to 80 times the radiation that a normal X-ray does, increasing the risk of developing cancer in children, according to recent studies.&#xA0;</strong>

About fifty percent of pediatric patients who go to emergency rooms with head injuries are immediately given a CT scan, even though the American Academy of Pediatrics says a thorough examination should be conducted first. Less than half of parents are aware CT scans can pose a cancer risk to their child, new research reveals.

Children who get two or three CT scans before they turn 15 have a three times greater chance of developing brain cancer, according to a June 2012 study in <em>The Lancet</em>. Those that undergo five to 10 scans in the same time-frame have a three times higher risk for developing leukemia.

&quot;Clinicians may therefore have a greater responsibility to initiate conversations with families about risks/benefits of CT rather than do so only when prompted by the parent,&quot; wrote researchers of a June <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em> study, which showed that 5,000 future cancer cases may be tied to the 4 million pediatric CT scans performed annually.

<strong>Those taking the weight loss product known as Fat Zero should be aware that it includes sibutramine, a prescription diet drug that has been pulled off the U.S. market by the Food and Drug Administration due to its dangerous side effects.&#xA0;</strong>

Although Fat Zero claims to be safe due to its so-called natural ingredients, the sibutramine in it can damage the heart and is known to substantially increase blood pressure and/or pulse rate in some patients. It also affects several brain chemicals, including serotonin and norepinephrine, and can actually increase appetite in some people.

Fat Zero &quot;may present a significant risk for patients with a history of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure arrhythmias, or stroke,&quot; said the FDA in a notice to consumers. &quot;This product may also interact, in life-threatening ways, with other medications a consumer may be taking.&quot;

Unlike prescription drugs, supplements and herbal products are not regulated by the FDA before they are sold. So long as makers don&apos;t make specific healthy claims, they can sell products made with ingredients that are &quot;generally recognized as safe.&quot; But the FDA can test these products and warn the public if potentially dangerous ingredients are found. Read the full details here:

<strong>Diet products contain dangerous drugs, FDA warns</strong>

Losing weight is never worth taking drugs that might kill you. Fat Zero and other &#x201C;quick weight loss remedies&#x201D; almost always turn out to be more detrimental to your health than the extra pounds. Instead, eat right and exercise; for the majority of people, that will more than sufficiently keep those unwanted pounds at bay.

<strong>Nearly 70 percent of Americans are on at least one prescription drug, and researchers believe this number will only increase in the future, according to CBS Atlanta reports.&#xA0;</strong>

Researchers from the Mayo Clinic report that antibiotics, antidepressants and painkiller opioids are the most common prescriptions given to Americans.&#xA0;More than half of Americans receive at least two prescriptions, while twenty percent of U.S. patients were found to be on five or more prescription medications.

As a whole, women and older adults received the most prescription drugs, while antidepressants and opioids were most common among young and middle-aged adults.

&quot;Often when people talk about health conditions they&apos;re talking about chronic conditions such as heart disease or diabetes,&quot; Dr. St. Sauver stated in a Mayo Clinic press release. &quot;However, the second most common prescription was for antidepressants -- that suggest mental health is a huge issue and is something we should focus on. And the third most common drugs were opioids, which is a bit concerning considering their addicting nature.&quot;

Expenditures on prescription drugs reached $250 billion in 2009, and accounted for 12 percent of total personal health care expenditures. Read the full details here:

Given the number of prescription medications that Americans are taking, doctors and their patients must be on the lookout for polypharmacy issues such as drug-drug interactions, drug dependency/addiction and abuse.

<strong>All patients should be aware of six common surgeries that carry significant risks of being done without medical necessity, according to federal data and independent studies.&#xA0;</strong>

    <li><strong>Cardiac angioplasty</strong>&#xA0;- In cases where patients were not suffering acute heart attack symptoms, 12% of all angioplasty procedures were found to lack medical necessity, according to a&#xA0;<em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>&#xA0;study. The procedure has risks including heart attack, stroke or death in two to six percent of patients.</li>
    <li><strong>Cardiac pacemakers -</strong>&#xA0;A 2011 study in the&#xA0;<em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>&#xA0;found that in 22.5% of cases of patients who had an implantable cardioverter-defribrillator to correct heartbeat irregularities, no medical evidence was found to support the installation.</li>
    <li><strong>Back surgery, spinal fusion -</strong>&#xA0;More than 17% of patients assessed in a 2011&#xA0;<em>Surgical Neurology International&#xA0;</em>study were told they needed spinal surgery when they had no abnormal neurological or radiographic findings in their case histories.</li>
    <li><strong>Hysterectomy</strong>&#xA0;- A 2000 study for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found the surgery was recommended inappropriately in about 70% of cases they assessed, often because doctors did not try non-surgical approaches.</li>
    <li><strong>Knee and hip replacement&#xA0;</strong>- Researchers of a 2012&#xA0;<em>Health Affairs&#xA0;</em>study found that patients who received information on joint replacements and alternative treatments had 26% fewer hip replacements and 38% fewer knee replacements.</li>
    <li><strong>Cesarean section -&#xA0;</strong>There are vast differences in practice patterns nationwide, with cesarean rates varying tenfold across hospitals - from 7.1% to 69.9% - according to a 2013&#xA0;<em>Health Affairs</em>&#xA0;study.</li>

<strong>Up to 35 percent of all college kids report using prescription ADHD pills like Adderall and Ritalin as a study tool, a staggering statistic that needs to be cracked down on immediately, according to Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY).&#xA0;</strong>

&quot;For somebody to call up and say &apos;well, my doctor prescribed it at home, send me pills, here&apos;s the prescription number...&apos; that&apos;s not good enough,&quot; said Schumer in a recent CBS News article. &quot;If a student gets 100 or 200 Adderall pills, even if they are legitimately entitled, they may lend a bunch to their friends.&quot;

To deal with the abuse of prescription ADHD pills, Schumer also recommends offering short-term counseling, time management and procrastination workshops, and medication consultation to students with a prescription. Read the full details here:

<strong>Hospital CEOs throughout the U.S. continue to be awarded bonuses for driving the kind of profits and expansion many say are no longer affordable for patients, employers and taxpayers, according to a recent ABC News article.&#xA0;</strong>

Across the nation, boards at nonprofit hospitals are often paying bosses in part for financial and expansion goals - such as patient volume increases at primary and specialty care clinics and growth in urgent-care center visits - rather than delivering value, undermining reform measures in the 2010 health law that aim to cut unnecessary treatment and control costs.

&quot;Boards of trustees in health care are oriented around top-line, revenue goals,&quot; said Dr. Donald Berwick, a longtime reform advocate who ran Medicare and Medicaid for President Obama. &quot;They celebrate the CEO when the hospital is full instead of rewarding business models that improve patients&apos; care.&quot;

U.S. hospitals spend twice as much per discharged patient as hospitals in other developed nations without delivering much better results, according to the Commonwealth Fund, with thirty percent of U.S. health care costs deemed unnecessary. Read the full details here:

This investigation reveals what has become abundantly obvious in the healthcare industry: hospitals are businesses driven by a desire to increase profit margins, rather than centers driven by a desire to provide quality health care.

<strong>Many Americans, particularly those over the age of 60, are taking prescription drugs which harm more than help them, according to a recent review of the book <em>Are Your Prescriptions Killing You?</em> in <em>The Courier-Journal</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

The book demonstrates how blind faith in the benefits of medication can often lead to a fatal outcome. Rather than stopping a patient&apos;s medication as it causes significant harm, a doctor may keep prescribing more and more pills to achieve the desired effect.

The author, Armon Neel Jr., PharmD., urges both patients and physicians to be more aware of the dangers of prescription drugs. Warning people of the risks of polypharmacy, Neel performs a critical public service, countering the pharmaceutical companies which have a loud voice encouraging people to take medications.

The overall message of the book is clear: every patient over age 60 should discuss with their physician the desired intent, potential harms, and rationale for prolonged use of medications. Read the full review here:

<strong>Book review: &apos;Are Your Prescriptions Killing You?&apos;</strong>

Unfortunately, polypharmacy has become a way of life for the over 60 year old population. If you are maintained on more than one or two drugs, you should have a long conversation with your physician to make sure all of the drugs are necessary and what side effects are possible. Both the patient and the physician, should always try to limit the number of medications that a patient is taking.

If you or anyone in your family has suffered serious side effects or damages from a medication error you should seek legal investigation immediately.&#xA0;Crandall &amp; Pera Law&#xA0;is&#xA0;available to help answer your questions and guide you in determining your next steps.

<strong>Naturally-occurring human genes, including the breast cancer predisposition gene (BRCA), can no longer be patented by companies thanks to a recent decision by the Supreme Court.</strong>

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has been awarding patents on human genes for almost 30 years, but the court has now said that laws of nature, natural phenomena and abstract ideas are not patentable.

&quot;We hold that a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,&quot; wrote Justice Clarence Thomas in the court&apos;s decision.

Myriad Genetics Inc. currently sells the only BRCA gene test, which looks for mutations associated with much greater risks of breast and ovarian cancer, due to patents on two genes. Opponents of its patents say the company can use the patents to keep other researchers from working with the BRCA gene to develop other tests.

&quot;Myriad did not invent the BRCA genes and should not control them,&quot; said Sandra Park, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union Women&apos;s Rights Project. &quot;Because of this ruling, patients will have greater access to genetic testing and scientists can engage in research on these genes without fear of being sued.&quot; Read the full details here:

Luckily, our Supreme Court ruled that medical device companies cannot stifle medical innovation by patenting a gene and thereby limit other companies&apos; ability to develop useful tests and procedures associated with the patented gene. This is a major victory for consumers.

Investigators installed cameras at Autumn Health Care without the knowledge of the staff and administration, but with the permission of the residents or their guardians, to record what state Attorney General Mike DeWine described as &quot;absolutely shocking and disturbing&quot; treatment of residents.

Video showed Autumn Health Care staff members putting a stroke victim&apos;s food tray on his disabled side so he was unable to eat and not responding to another patient&apos;s breathing apparatus falling out during treatment, just two examples of the facility&apos;s many deficiencies.

Autumn Health Care has been listed as a &quot;special-focus facility&quot; by the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for 53 months. The Ohio Department of Health has now cited its intent to revoke the facility&apos;s state operating license and may revoke the nursing home&apos;s eligibility to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.

&quot;We&apos;re considering a variety of legal options, both criminally and civilly, including Medicare fraud, falsification, patient abuse and theft,&quot; said DeWine during a news conference outside the facility last week. While this was the first time cameras had been used in such an Ohio nursing home investigation, it will not be the last. Read the full details here:

Elderly people are at great risk for abuse because of their inability to communicate what happens to them when alone with the staff. This article exemplifies our worst fears about nursing homes. Unfortunately, if you suspect a loved one is being neglected or abused in a nursing home, all too often your fears are justified.

<strong>While medical mistakes may be difficult for doctors to admit, more hospitals are wisely writing error disclosures into their facilities&apos; policies to avoid similar lapses in the future.&#xA0;</strong>

From 2002 to 2005 the proportion of hospitals with disclosure policies doubled to 70 percent, according to a 2007 New England Journal of Medicine article. In 2006, a working group representing Harvard-affiliated hospitals established that a disclosure policy must include three elements: the provider must take responsibility, apologize and discuss preventive measures with the patient or the family.

Traditional attitudes and practices regarding medical errors are finally changing, with policymakers, doctors and other providers realizing that errors are often systemic problems rather than incidental lapses and should not only be treated as a problem if a patient sues.

As Dr. Manoj Jain writes in a recent article in <em>The Washington Post</em>, &quot;Errors were considered incidental lapses and used as teaching points among residents; we were not to discuss them with patients unless absolutely necessary...If patients&apos; families had questions, we were to be vague with our responses, essentially brushing them off.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong><a title="Medical errors are hard for doctors to admit, but it&apos;s wise to apologize to patients" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/medical-errors-are-hard-for-doctors-to-admit-but-its-wise-to-apologize-to-patients/2013/05/24/95e21a2a-915f-11e2-9abd-e4c5c9dc5e90_story_1.html" target="_blank">Medical errors are hard for doctors to admit, but it&apos;s wise to apologize to patients</a></strong>

Doctors should be commended for admitting when they have made a mistake. Unfortunately, it is more often the case that a doctor will only admit their mistake when it has caused little to no injury. If there has been a significant injury, often times the corporate entities that oversee and own most physicians&apos; practices have strict policies in place prohibiting a doctor from admitting wrongdoing. This can result in years of litigation before the doctor and/or his or her corporate owner are forced by a jury to accept responsibility.

<strong>Mistreatment among senior citizens continues to be a nationwide crisis with an estimated three to five million older adults being victim of some form of abuse in 2011, according to the Elder Maltreatment Alliance.&#xA0;</strong>

Among a random sample of 452 adults with relatives 65 or older in nursing home care in Michigan, nearly one quarter of the respondents reported <em>at least</em>&#xA0;one incident of physical abuse by nursing home staff, according to a recent study undertaken at Michigan State University.

Limitations in activities of daily living, older adult behavioral difficulties, and previous victimization by non-staff perpetrators have been linked to a greater chance of senior citizens experiencing physical abuse. Caregivers who had been abused by patients, in comparison to those who had not, were found to be more likely to direct abusive behavior back toward the patient in their care in a University of Medicine &amp; Dentistry of New Jersey study.

Most nursing homes experienced verbal, physical material, psychological and - to a lesser degree - sexual abuse in a study done by the Department of Health Policy &amp; Management at the University of Pittsburgh. Resident-to-resident abuse is also considered common enough to be an issue of concern impacting both the quality of life and safety of many residents. Read the full details here:

If you have a loved one who is a resident at a nursing home, pay close attention to their care. Look for signs of abuse such as unexplained signs of trauma. Many nursing home residents often suffer from dementia or some other mental incapacity and are extremely vulnerable to abusive nursing home employees. If you find signs of unexplained trauma, immediately contact the Director of Nursing and ask them to explain the bruising or cuts. If they can&#x2019;t, you may want to consider relocating your loved one to a new facility.

<strong>A Cincinnati-area nursing home has been placed on a federal &quot;Special Focus Facility&quot; list, ranking it among the worst facilities in the country due to a history of serious quality issues.&#xA0;</strong>

East Galbraith Health Care Center&#xA0;in Deer Park, Ohio, owned by Provider Services Holdings Co. of Cleveland, was rated much below average in health inspections and staff in The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Service (CMS) report. East Galbraith also scored below average on a 2011 resident satisfaction survey conducted by the Ohio Department of Aging.

The three most recent inspections by state officials in 2012 revealed 12 deficiencies at the facility - twice the state average - including a failure to report to police that a female resident with dementia was being sexually abused by a male resident with dementia, a female resident with incontinence having her clothes changed by male workers against her wishes, and at least one patient not given the proper dosage of medication prescribed for depression.

The facility must make improvements if it does not want to face fines or be terminated from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. About 50% of the nursing homes in the SFF program significantly improve their quality of care within 24-30 months after being listed, while about 16% tend to be terminated from Medicare and Medicaid, according to CMS.

<strong>Patients with underlying heart disease should not use antibiotics commonly prescribed for bronchitis and sinus infections as they may dramatically increase the risk of death from heart problems, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.&#xA0;</strong>

Use of the antibiotic azithromycin (sold under the brand name Zithromax) was linked with nearly a threefold increase in the risk of dying from heart problems over the five-day treatment, compared with not taking antibiotics, in the study of more than a million young and middle-age adults living in Denmark.

Other antibiotics, including penicillin and erythromycin, have similar increased risks, leading researchers to believe health risks due to bacterial infection, rather than the drugs themselves, increases the risk of death from heart problems.

People with known problems in their hearts&apos; electrical systems (such as arrhythmias), those with structural changes to the heart or heart damage, and those with underlying heart disease should be cautious when using the drug, according to researchers.

For the general population, the results of the study are reassuring in that they suggest azithromycin &quot;can be prescribed without concern about an increased risk of death from cardiovascular cause,&quot; according to the researchers. In 2011, about 40 million people in the U.S. received prescriptions for the antibiotic. Read the full details here:

<strong>Families and survivors of truck crash fatalities and injuries have joined with the Truck Safety Coalition (TSC) to limit commercial truck size and weight limits by law.</strong>

The safety advocates are pushing support for the Safe Highways and Infrastructure Preservation Act (SHIPA), which would freeze current federal truck size and weight limits, close existing loopholes that allow operation of overweight trucks, and establish an enforcement program to ensure accountability.

&quot;Every year more than 4,000 people are slaughtered on our nation&apos;s highways while corporate trucking and shipping interests continue to push Congress for heavier trucks,&quot; said Joan Claybrook, Chairperson of Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways (CRASH). &quot;Heavy trucks are deadly, dangerous and destructive. Families are paying with their lives and with their wallets.&quot;

Kentucky ranks in the top 15 worst states for truck crash fatalities, based on the most recent data available for 2011. Read the full story here:

<strong>The increase in about 25 million newly insured patients under the Affordable Care Act arrives at a time when the nation already has 15,000 fewer primary-care doctors than it needs, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.&#xA0;</strong>

Currently, uninsured patients are more likely to not go to a doctor when sick or skip prescriptions. The uninsured are less likely to be up to date on cholesterol, blood-pressure and cancer screenings.

More demand for healthcare may lead to months-long waits to see doctors, delays in finding specialists and strains on hospitals and outpatient clinics, healthcare experts have said.

As many as 7 million uninsured Americans have begun shopping for private plans through government-run exchanges, with Medicaid programs expanded in about half the states come January 1.

&quot;It&apos;s like we&apos;re handing out bus tickets and the bus is already full,&quot; said Perry Pugno, vice president for medical education at the American Academy of Family Physicians. &quot;The shortfall of primary-care access is not an insignificant problem, and it&apos;s going to get worse.&quot; Read the full article here:

Another impact of the Affordable Care Act would be newly insured patients seeking medical care and crowding the offices of physicians. Preventative care? Sounds like a good thing.

<strong>Young women diagnosed with cancer in one breast may be driven to remove them both due to fear, not facts, according to a new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.&#xA0;</strong>

The study finds that women younger than 40 who opted for a second mastectomy of a healthy breast did so to reduce the perceived risk of another cancer, despite medical evidence that says it likely will not improve survival. Often, they simply wanted peace of mind.

Evidence shows the actual risk of getting cancer in the second breast is very low - about 2-4 percent within five years - and that the operation may improve survival in less than 10 percent of the breast cancer population. Women who have both breasts removed are also at trwice the risk for wound complications including bleeding, infection and other problems, according to a July study in the Annals of Surgical Oncology.

Since the late 1990s, these contralateral prophylactic mastectomies, or CPMs, have quadrupled from about 4-6 percent of patients opting to remove a healthy breast to between 11-25 percent, according to researchers. These figures may point to potential gaps in the conversation between doctors and their patients.

&quot;We&apos;re concerned that the risk is not being effectively communicated,&quot; said Shoshana M. Rosenberg of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Harvard School of Public Health, who led the study. &quot;We&apos;re concerned that some of the anxiety and fears and concerns are not being adequately addressed.&quot; Read the full story here:

<strong>Unfounded fears may prompt young cancer patients to remove healthy breasts</strong>

A delay in diagnosis of cancer is always a significant fear. Unfortunately, many women are now opting to perform double mastectomy to avoid what they believe to a be high risk of breast cancer.

<strong>New studies show that many patients do not benefit from costly screening tests, that can also come with false positives and excessive radiation.&#xA0;</strong>

Here are 5 medical tests that may prove to do more harm than good, according to ABC News:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Bone-density test</strong> - Aside from those who are at high risk for weak bones, women should wait until they are 65 to have their bone density measured. While the scan may detect mild bone loss, the risk of fracture is low and the drugs that may be prescribed to treat this condition carry side effects and haven&apos;t proved to be highly beneficial in these cases.</li>
    <li><strong>CT scan or MRI for headaches </strong>- Most of the time a careful medical history and a neurological exam (e.g., measuring reflexes) can diagnose the problem. And CT scans involve a hefty dose of radiation.</li>
    <li><strong>EKG or exercise stress test</strong>&#xA0;- Hooking up to an electrocardiogram and/or taking an exercise stress test makes sense if you have symptoms of heart disease or are at high risk, but those at low risk who are just looking for reassurance may get inaccurate results that can lead to further testing and overtreatment with drugs.</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging for lower-back pain</strong>&#xA0;- You don&apos;t want to skip an X-ray, CT scan or MRI if there are signs of a severe problem (a history of cancer, fever or pain that lasts several weeks), but lower-back pain often gets better in about a month.</li>
    <li><strong>PET/CT for cancer screening in healthy people </strong>- The likelihood of finding cancer in healthy adults using these screening methods is extremely low, according to the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.</li>

<strong>The University of Toledo Medical Center is asking a state court to dismiss a lawsuit filed after a nurse threw away a kidney meant for transplant last year.</strong>

Paul Fudacz, Jr., then 20 years old, donated a perfect-match kidney to his then 24-year-old sister Sarah, who was in end-state renal failure last August. But the transplant operation was stopped when a nurse accidentally threw away the donor organ, which was stored in a protective slush, according to legal papers. Doctors tried to resuscitate the organ, but it was rendered unusable.

UTMC&#xA0;was eventually able to arrange another kidney for Sarah, who had to go through dialysis and four surgeries in the months between her failed surgery and the successful one. The hospital&apos;s live-donor program was temporarily suspended after a state investigation, but has since been resumed.

The medical center denies it was medically negligent and is also challenging claims by the family to recover damages for pain and suffering.

&quot;They are admitting they threw the kidney away, but they are not admitting substandard medical care,&quot; Fudacz family lawyer James E. Arnold told ABCNews.com. &quot;They must think that it is within standard care to throw a kidney away. It would be more decent to admit substandard care, and the family shouldn&apos;t have to be going through litigation to prove it.&quot; Read the full story here:

<strong>Hospital infections is not only extremely dangerous to a patient&apos;s health, but expensive as well, according&#xA0;to a recent article in the <em>Columbus Dispatch</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

The <em>Journal of American Medical Association Internal Medicine</em>&#xA0;estimates the annual cost of five common and preventable healthcare-associated infections at $9.8 billion. These infections can drag out hospital stays, put patients in intensive care and sometimes kill.

For years, hospitals have been under pressure to drive down infections, from hand-washing rules to regulating procedures so the safest approach is used every time. Efforts at national and local levels have reported success, but hospitals that have driven down infections to the point they are almost unheard of are rare.

&quot;Zero is possible in some of these infections,&quot; said Dr. Julia Hallisy, founder of the Empowered Patient Coalition. &quot;...[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][I]t certainly is happening at certain institutions, and they&apos;re sustaining it.&quot;

Efforts to reduce infections have been described as &quot;relentless.&quot; &quot;Secret shoppers&quot; who checked up on the hand-hygiene initiative of staff members in several hospitals found observation of proper techniques go from 29 percent in August 2010 to 86 percent last November.

Infections in the hospital setting is a tremendous problem leading to increased length of stay, skyrocketing complications and increased mortality.

<strong>National Church Residences, the nation&apos;s largest nonprofit provider of affordable housing for senior citizens, will now offer health care along with medical care and other services to elderly patients where they live, according to a recent article in <em>The Columbus Dispatch</em>.</strong>

NCR serves more than 25,000 residents with more than 300 facilities in 28 states and Puerto Rico. Along with continuing-care retirement campuses, assisted-living centers, nursing homes, home health care and hospice, NCR also has on-site primary-care services at a number of residences and offers health care at adult day-care centers. Such facilities often prevent the need for expensive nursing home care.

&quot;The objective is to keep people in their homes, whether that&apos;s one of our housing units or in their own home,&quot; said Jeff Wolf, senior vice president of philanthropy and communications for NCR. &quot;If we keep them healthy at home, in the long run it improves their quality of life and it helps contain health-care costs.&quot;

NCR offers these services to encourage senior citizens to take care of themselves and maintain their independence while also decreasing the cost of health care. Health care is currently offered through the nonprofit itself within the state of Ohio. Read the full story here:

Assisted living facilities that allow seniors to live independently, but with skilled help for some items, promote a decrease in health care costs and increase the living standards for the elderly.

<strong>About 1 in 4 deaths of heart disease could be averted with better prevention efforts and treatment, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&#xA0;</strong>

Heart disease is the leading killer in the United States; it accounts for nearly 800,000 deaths a year, equaling about 30 percent of all deaths nationwide.

The report looked at deaths occurring in people younger than 75 that could have been prevented by more effective public health measures, lifestyle changes or medical care. As many as 200,000 Americans might have survived a heart attack or stroke in 2010 if they had received screening and treatment for preventable causes of heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and smoking, the CDC report found.

The 2014 launch of key elements of the Affordable Care Act could help reduce avoidable deaths, according to CDC officials. The law is intended to provide better access to treatment for millions of uninsured Americans and routine coverage for preventive screenings. Read the full details here:

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US and prevention is not complex. Healthy lifestyle habits, regular medical care and preventative medication can curtain the mortality figures substantially. The key is affordable healthcare, education for patients and the desire to lead a healthier lifestyle.

<strong>Missed or delayed diagnoses are the most common medical mistakes resulting in malpractice claims, followed by medication errors, according to a review in <em>BMJ Open.</em></strong>

Failure to or delay in diagnosis represents 26% - 63% of all malpractice claims according to researchers from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Medical School of Dublin. In adults, common missed or delayed diagnoses included cancer and myocardial infarction, while in children they included meningitis.

Medication errors, meanwhile, represent 5.6% - 20% of all malpractice claims. In the U.S., general practice ranked in the top five specialties accounting for the most claims, compared with other disciplines, representing 7.6% - 20% of all claims.

As the authors wrote, &quot;This review of malpractice claims in primary care highlights diagnosis and medication error as areas to be prioritized in developing educational strategies and risk management systems.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>Nurses will be more in demand than ever when the Affordable Care Act goes into effect next year, but a lack of educators has led to a nationwide nursing shortage, according to a recent NBC News article.&#xA0;</strong>

Nurses will take on the lion&apos;s share of work when millions of Americans get health insurance for the first time starting in January.&#xA0;The nursing profession is a rare bright spot in the U.S. unemployment picture as graduates receive job offers even before they collect their diplomas.

But, due to a lack of professors - one study shows 1,181 faculty jobs open at 662 nursing schools - nursing schools are unable to crank out enough graduates with advanced degrees. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, U.S. nursing schools rejected 75,587 qualified applicants from baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs in 2011.

Most nursing schools now want their instructors and professors to have doctoral degrees, but lower salaries are not drawing these professionals out of the medical field into teaching.

&quot;Money is not in academia,&quot; said Beatrice Kalisch, a distinguished professor at the University of Michigan. &quot;And with states cutting budgets, staff have to take furlough days, so that cuts their pay even more. And you have to go into huge debt to get your degree, so it&apos;s like, wow, why do all that?&quot; Read the full story here:

<strong>&apos;Double whammy&apos;: Nursing shortage starts in the classroom</strong>

A shortage of nurses and the faculty to train new nurses is a significant problem in the quality of healthcare. Many nurses opt for a 2-year degree rather than a more rigorous 4-year degree in order to enter the workforce sooner. This can result in inferior training for the nurses who care for us in the hospital.

<strong>Implementing a transitional care program for patients from hospital to home could reduce readmission rates up to 20 percent, according to a recent study.&#xA0;</strong>

Researchers found that helping people recently released from the hospital understand how to care for themselves and informing their primary care doctors about their stay may reduce their risk of being admitted back into the hospital.

&quot;The time of discharge from the hospital was a very vulnerable time for patients with complex care needs and we need to get resources&#xA0;in place to make sure they go more smoothly,&quot; said Dr. Annette DuBard, the lead author of the study that calculated the rate of readmissions of more than 13,000 Medicaid patients in North Carolina.

Studies conducted at individual hospitals have also found that programs that teach patients and their families how to manage their medical conditions at home and follow up with patients after they were back home have promising results. Read the full details here:

<strong>Hospital to home focus may reduce readmissions, study finds</strong>

Early discharge from the hospital is a leading cause of both re-admission as well as medical malpractice and wrongful death in the U.S. Better transition plans are necessary to protect against this.

<strong>An orthopedic surgeon in New York is still licensed to operate in the state even though he is currently at the center of at least 250 medical malpractice and negligence lawsuits, according to <em>Outpatient Surgery.&#xA0;</em></strong>

Spyros Panos, MD, who practiced in suburban Dutchess County, is being accused of fraudulent, unnecessary or excessive procedures and is said to have scheduled as many as 22 surgeries in a day. He has reportedly failed to adequately cement joint replacement components, implanted incorrect components and carried out an unneeded rotator cuff repair while ignoring a fractured clavicle.

In one horrible instance, Panos noted surgical details of an arthritic knee repair of a patient who died less than 24 hours after the procedure. The examiner&apos;s report showed that these treatments never actually took place.

&quot;He put her under anesthesia, placed the scope in her knee and then closed her up without performing any surgery,&quot; said an attorney for the patient&apos;s family. &quot;The reports showed no hardware in place and, certainly, no evidence of a total knee reconstruction.&quot; Read the full story here:

<strong>Problems with technological advancements may be drastically adding to the amount of medical errors that affect up to 16 percent of patients admitted to hospitals, according to a recent <em>Medical Daily </em>article.&#xA0;</strong>

In a comparison of 28 studies regarding medical mistakes, researchers found that 70 percent of errors are related to equipment available in operating rooms, 44 percent are due to accessibility, configuration and settings of equipment in the room, and 34 percent are related to direct malfunctioning of equipment during use. Between 12 and 18 percent of malpractice claims are made and approved based on equipment and technology failures.

Close to 50 percent of all adverse events in hospitals are attributable to surgical procedures. While it is true that many emergency procedures are performed without any pre-planning and without much notice, the results of these studies are alarmingly based on all procedures.

A checklist created by the World Health Organization must now be consulted before and during a procedure in all operating rooms and is meant to ensure than an operating room has all the possible equipment needed in working order. Checklists, and similar interventions, reduced equipment error by an average of 49 percent. Read the full details here:

<strong>Nursing home facilities nationwide continue to be hit with large verdicts in negligence cases due to improper treatment of the elderly residents placed under their care, according to a recent <em>Senior Housing News</em>&#xA0;article.&#xA0;</strong>

Trans Healthcare Inc. was just slammed with $1 billion in punitive damages and $110 million in compensatory damages regarding the death of a female resident in 2007, the company&apos;s fourth major verdict within the state of Florida. The 69-year-old woman suffered multiple falls while at the facility, which did not provide proper supervision, according to the lawsuit.

Other staggering damages against nursing home corporations in recent years include a $91.5 million judgment against HCR ManorCare in August 2011 for failure to properly care for a resident who died shortly after a brief stay at its Charleston, West Virginia facility. Emiritus was found guilty of elder abuse and wrongful death in a lawsuit brought against the company by the family of a former resident who allegedly developed fatal pressure sores at an Emeritus-operated assisted living community.

While neglect was originally defined by the Nursing Home Care Act as a long-term care facility&apos;s failure to provide adequate medical or personal care or maintenance, resulting in physical or mental injury or deterioration to a resident, the state of Illinois has broadened that definition to cover all neglectful care, whether it results in an injury or not.

Verdicts of this magnitude are generally cited by the media as excessive and examples of the need for tort reform. However, the amount of this $1.1 billion verdict will obviously cause a change in the system which may benefit thousands of families and patients in nursing homes around the country.

<strong>Traumatic brain injury patients could be enrolled in a medical study, possibly without their consent, starting as soon as next month at two Boston hospital emergency departments.&#xA0;</strong>

The study - to be conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston Medical Center - will test whether administering the hormone progesterone in the hours immediately after an injury could limit brain damage, as early studies have shown it may slow the process of cells continuing to die following the initial trauma.

This is the first study approved at Boston hospitals using an exemption to the federal requirement to get approval from the patient or a surrogate before administering an experimental drug. The researchers will obtain consent if the patient can communicate or if family can be located within the hour following the injury, but will also administer the drug and give the option of pulling out of the trial later if that is not possible.

Investigational studies may help patients in the future, but they also run the risk of damaging those who initially try them. The concern with this study is a patient could be enrolled without a choice and end up being worse off for it.

&quot;Obviously, we&apos;re pleased to see that we&apos;ve broken the trend of steadily increasing drug overdose numbers,&quot; said Van Ingram, executive director of the Office of Drug Control Policy. &quot;As House Bill 1 has taken effect, opiates available through illicit means - doctor shopping and street sales - have become less available....&quot;

Even with the overall drop, Kentucky may have another drug epidemic on its hands. Overdose deaths attributed to the use of heroin - a cheaper and more available alternative for drug users in Kentucky - increased 550 percent in 2012 with 143 cases, up from 22 in 2011. Read the full story here:

<strong>Surgeons have no regulations on how many surgeries they can perform in a given day, even though studies have found that surgical complications for patients can increase as much as 83 percent when a surgeon is not fully rested, according to an article published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine.&#xA0;</em></strong>

Surgeons interviewed in a 2011 Georgia Regents University study believe fatigue has an effect on their &quot;emotions, cognitive capability, and fine-motor skills,&quot; but few discussed the effect on patient safety. A 2008 study performed by the Royal College of Surgeons in London showed the dangers of muscle fatigue in a surgeon, noting it increases the longer the surgery takes.

While the Joint Commission sent out an alert in 2011 warning that fatigue increases risk of medical errors, compromises patient safety, and increases risk to personal well-being, it does not provide guidance on the number of surgeries that can be performed by a physician in a given day.

&quot;It is expected that all surgical procedures are performed in accordance with current standards of professional practice,&quot; said James O&apos;Hare, a New York state Health Department spokesman. Meanwhile, one orthopedic surgeon in the state is facing 261 medical malpractice lawsuits in NY state Supreme Court after harming many patients during his average of 17 surgeries per day. Read the full details here:

<strong>Studies: Tired surgeons a risk to patient safety</strong>

Medical malpractice and many wrongful death cases result when a surgeon is over tired, not well rested and not sharp during surgery. Each patient should be aware of their surgeon&apos;s schedule and pace before having surgery.

<strong>Exposure to pre-eclampsia, a life-threatening disorder caused by a rapid rise in blood pressure in 3-5% of pregnant women, could increase the risk of cerebral palsy in preterm or small birth weight newborns, according to a study published in <em>BMJ</em>.</strong>

Researchers from Norway monitored 849 children with cerebral palsy and 616,658 without to conduct the first study to report that the association between pre-eclampsia exposure and cerebral palsy may be mediated by being small at birth.

The study found that children who were both born moderately preterm (between 32 and 36 weeks) and very preterm (less than 31 weeks) and exposed to pre-eclampsia had a significantly increased risk of cerebral palsy, if they were also smaller than usual at birth. Among children born at term, exposed children born at normal weight did not have excess risk of cerebral palsy. Read the full details here:

<strong>Medication errors, from incorrect dosage to the wrong prescribed medicine, occur millions of times every year in pharmacies and hospitals, providing harmful and fatal risks for patients.</strong>

Studies estimate tens of millions of medication mistakes happen every year, resulting in more than 1.5 million people harmed, and more than 200,000 deaths. But the numbers are believed to be much higher because many go unreported.

Errors can occur for a variety of reasons, either in the dispensing process, transcribing the medication when a patient is released or simply giving a medication to the wrong patient. Recent studies show the use of barcode scanning and electronic prescriptions have helped reduce errors by as much as half in pharmacies, where dispensing errors are most common, but these systems make mistakes too.

The Institute for Safe Medication Practices is working closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to track and prevent medication errors by keeping a list of nearly 700 look alike or sound alike drugs that may be confused with one another. It also tracks high alert medications such&#xA0;as insulin, narcotics, opiates and blood thinners.

Patients can take steps to make sure they are not a victim of medication errors by asking their doctor or pharmacist questions to know exactly what medication you are getting and what it is for. Ask the pharmacist to read the name on the prescription and have them open the bag at the counter, read the labels and look at the medication to make sure it is right before you leave.

<strong>New guidelines that provide a major change for preventing heart attacks and strokes are being debated in the medical community, according to a recent article in <em>The Columbus Dispatch</em>.</strong>

The guidelines, drafted by heart experts for the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, relies on a formula using factors like age and high blood pressure to estimate a patient&apos;s risk, rather than a specific cholesterol number.

One-third of U.S. adults ages 40 to 75 would meet the threshold to consider taking a cholesterol-lowering statin like Lipitor and Zocor under this new advice, as compared for only about 15 percent under the current guidelines.

The new guidelines are also the first that aim to prevent strokes and heart attacks and customize risk assessment for women versus men and black versus white people. Read the full details here:

With all of the attention other diseases command these days, it is important to remember that heart disease is still the number one killer worldwide. Once you are above the age of 40, ask your doctor about your cholesterol levels and whether medication is appropriate.

Fifteen nursing homes throughout Northeast Ohio are among the worst-rated facilities in the nation and show no signs of improving, according to an USA Today analysis of ratings given by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The ratings take into consideration patient abuse, cleanliness of the facility and equipment, staff licensing and quality of overall patient care.

One nursing home saw its ratings drop from 5 stars to 2 stars after a hidden camera caught nurse&apos;s aides repeatedly abusing a resident.

These fifteen nursing homes have been rated as well below average for the last three years, even as more homes across the country have seen their ratings improve:

<strong>Diagnosis errors, the most common form of medical mistakes, lead to permanent damage or death for as many as 160,000 patients each year, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.&#xA0;</strong>

Healthcare providers are turning to a number of innovative strategies to fix the oversights in the quest for the right diagnosis. Computers are used to sift through medical records and prompt doctors to follow up on red-flag test results, while new devices and tests aim to help doctors identify diseases and conditions more accurately.

One of the biggest changes in the medical community will be a push to change the very culture of medicine. &quot;Doctors are being trained not to latch onto one diagnosis and stick with it no matter what,&quot; according to a recent <em>Wall Street Journal</em>&#xA0;article. &quot;Instead, they&apos;re being taught to keep an open mind when confronted with conflicting evidence and opinion.&quot;

These changes are looking to improve patient care and reduce the number of malpractice claims, of which diagnosis errors accounted for 35% of nearly $39 billion in payouts in the U.S. from 1986 to 2010. Read the full article here:

<strong>The Biggest Mistake Doctors Make</strong>

This article aptly notes that diagnostic error is the biggest patient safety issue doctors face.&#xA0; Fortunately, doctors are now being trained &#x201C;not to latch onto one diagnosis and stick with it no matter what.&#x201D; It is this mindset, that the doctor&#x2019;s original diagnosis must be correct, that leads to patient harm in many circumstances. This article also demonstrates why it is so important to ask your doctor what the results are for any test you undergo. Even when test results come back with abnormal findings, these findings are not always communicated to the patient.

<strong>With abuse of painkillers steadily on the rise, the Food and Drug Administration has recommended tighter controls on how doctors prescribe these drugs, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></strong>

A debate over whether painkillers that contain the narcotic hydrocodone should be controlled as tightly are more powerful painkillers such as OxyContin has been argued for years in the medical community. Doctors use the less powerful drugs to treat pain from injuries, arthritis, dental extractions and other problems.

The change proposed by the FDA would reduce the number of refills patients could get before going back to see their doctor by half to 90 days. Currently, a patient can refill a prescription for such drugs five times over a six-month period before needing a new prescription.

&quot;These are very difficult tradeoffs that our society has to make,&quot; said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA&apos;s center for drug evaluation and research. &quot;The reason we approve these drugs is for people in pain. But we can&apos;t ignore the epidemic on the other side.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>NYT: FDA seeks tighter control on prescriptions for class of painkillers</strong>

This effort by the FDA is a start that is long overdue. Too many patients are prescribed narcotics with minimal oversight for their injuries, end up addicted, and, in some cases, even die from accidental overdoses and drug interactions.

If you or anyone in your family has suffered serious side effects or damages from a medication error you should seek legal investigation immediately.&#xA0;<a href="/Contact.shtml">Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a>&#xA0;is&#xA0;available to help answer your questions and guide you in determining your next steps.

<b>Serious safety violations have forced the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to reprimand and shut down several commercial truckers recently,&#xA0;<strong>according to&#xA0;<em>Overdrive.</em></strong></b>

The Massachusetts owner of Korca Enterprises, Inc. paid a FMCSA investigator $1,000 to halt a negative compliance review last May and was charged on Sept. 26 in a one-count information with bribery of a public official.

FMCSA records list the carrier as having operating authority, but notes a 53-percent vehicle out-of-service rate and 12 inspections during the past 24 months. In exchange for the plea, the prosecutor agreed to recommend 12 months of probation.

Meanwhile, three long-haul drivers - licensed in Michigan, Texas and Illinois -&#xA0;have been ordered to cease interstate operations after investigations uncovered serious violations of federal safety regulations.

All three FMCSA investigations proceeded from the drivers&#x2019; involvement in crashes, two of which resulted in at least one fatality and the third a serious injury to a police officer.&#xA0;Read the full details here:

While most trucking companies would never resort to bribery, many &quot;look the other way&quot; when it comes to state and federal safety laws.&#xA0;It has been proven that safety regulations may be ignored when drivers are looking to shorten their time on the road.

<strong>A debate over whether paying living kidney donors is practical or ethical is brewing in the medical community as the number of donors continues to steadily decline.&#xA0;</strong>

More than 98,000 people are currently waiting for kidneys in the U.S. alone, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, with more than 4,500 fatalities while waiting for a donation last year. Meanwhile, the number of donors has fallen to 13,040 in 2012.

A research group in Canada wanted to find out if offering financial incentives would save money over the current organ donation system. They determined that paying living kidney donors $10,000 apiece would save about $340 per patient, compared with ongoing costs of dialysis.

&quot;We don&apos;t have enough organ donors coming forward,&quot; said Dr. Braden Manns, the leader of the study in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. &quot;We need to figure out a way to solve that problem. We shouldn&apos;t throw out, out of hand, solutions that could increase donations.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong>A new piece of legislation is aiming to give Ohio nursing home patients the explicit right to set up hidden monitoring devices in their rooms in order to catch staff in the acts of abuse or neglect.&#xA0;</strong>

Current state law is not clear on whether it is legal for patients to covertly set up cameras or recording devices in nursing homes. House Bill 298 would add a provision to the Resident Bill of Rights for Ohio to specifically authorize this practice.

The co-sponsor of the legislation is State Rep. Mike Duffey, whose own father is believed to be a victim of nursing home neglect. After the ordered closure of a nursing home in Zanesville after hidden cameras confirmed the complaints of patients, Duffey is &quot;outraged&quot; that the industry continues to block patients from installing surveillance equipment.

Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma already have similar laws guaranteeing the right to install monitoring equipment in nursing homes, and Florida and Massachusetts have approved pilot programs, according to the <em>Columbus Dispatch. </em>Read the full story here:

<strong>Prenatal diagnosis, a routine part of obstetric care, is on the cusp of further revolutionary developments of highly accurate and noninvasive tests, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.&#xA0;</em></strong>

Prenatal tests have been developed for more than 800 genetic disorders, greatly reducing the need for amniocentesis, or inserting a long needle into the uterus to extract fluid and cells surrounding the fetus.

The newest screening test is so accurate in detecting Down syndrome that few, if any, affected fetuses are missed. It can also detect other genetic diseases, like extra copies of chromosomes and a missing sex chromosome, late in the first trimester of pregnancy.

While the test is currently only recommended for women at high risk for having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality, and not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration, some doctors expect it to soon become routine for all pregnant women because it can be done earlier than other tests and reduce costs and the risk of complications. Read the full details here:

Exciting breakthroughs are close to being approved in the detection, screening and treatment of Down syndrome and other genetic diseases before birth.

<strong>As the Food and Drug Administration expedites reviews, many safety questions are left unanswered about new drugs even after they are approved, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</strong>

In an examination of 20 new drugs approved by the FDA in 2008, it was found that eight were given expedited review (5.1 years of clinical testing) and 12 standard review (7.5 years). But, in many cases, safety monitoring trials that were supposed to be conducted after the products were approved were either not conducted, not completed or not submitted to the FDA.

Of the drugs studied in 2008, the FDA required 85 follow-up trials to monitor for safety. By 2013, only 40 percent of those studies had been completed.

&quot;The testing of new drugs has shifted from a situation in which most testing was conducted prior to initial approval to a situation in which many innovative drugs are more rapidly approved after a small trial in a narrower patient population with extensive additional testing conducted after approval,&quot; the study&apos;s authors said.

While patient groups and drug companies applaud these measures in order to get medications into the hands of patients more quickly, critics say the FDA is approving products before they have been fully vetted. Read the full details here:

<strong>Doctors in their first year out of medical school are unlikely to display communications skills that can improve a patient&apos;s recovery and lead to greater patient satisfaction, according to a new study from Johns Hopkins University.&#xA0;</strong>

Observers recorded the actions of 29 internal medicine interns for three weeks to see whether they used five valued communications skills: introducing themselves, explaining their role to the patient, touching the patient, asking open-ended questions like, &quot;How are you feeling today?,&quot; and sitting down with the patient for a conversation.

In total, interns only performed all five behaviors during just 4% of their visits. They only introduced themselves to patients 40% of the time and explained their medical role 37% of the time. The interns only sat down with their patients 9% of the time.

&quot;It&apos;s no wonder patients don&apos;t feel connected to what we are telling them, because many times we are not doing as much as we could to make that connection,&quot; said Dr. Lauren Block, a former general internal medicine fellow at Johns Hopkins. Read the full article here:

Bedside manner is important. As this article demonstrates, it not only makes the patient more trusting of the doctor, but it promotes greater healing. With increasing pressure to bill more due to lower health insurance reimbursement rates, this behavior is unlikely to improve without a concerted effort by hospital administrators and medical school leaders.

<strong>Women who test positive for the BRCA gene mutation face a lot of uncertainty and conflicting information regarding their surgical options, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

Women with BRCA mutations often opt for risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectory (RRSO), which removes the ovaries and fallopian tubes, but others consider going further and removing their uterus as well through a hysterectomy.

There is debate among experts over whether RRSO is the best strategy for all women, causing many patients to be caught in the middle, struggling to balance conflicting information about hysterectomy as part of risk-reducing surgery. There is also no way to predict what each individual will face in the future, regardless of her choice.

There is scant evidence that women with BRCA mutations are more likely to develop uterine cancer, but worries persist due to anecdotal cases and the fact that uterine cancer is the most commonly diagnosed gynecologic cancer.

&quot;The biggest challenge is trying to make those risk-benefit decisions every day, every time and get it right,&quot; said Dr. Susan Domchek of the Basser Research Center for BRCA. &quot;Some people you&apos;re overtreating, and some you&apos;re undertreating.&quot; Read the full article here:

Better safe than sorry? If women have a genetic predisposition for cancer, is it better to have a hysterectomy or just have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed? This article demonstrates there is little agreement to this question.

<strong>New studies find that injecting any liquid, not just steroids, into the area around the spinal cord will help relieve back pain.</strong>

Epidurals are the most commonly used treatment for back pain, but these new studies suggest even plain saline solution works just as well as steroids to help reduce inflammation, enhance blood flow to the nerves and clean out scar tissue.

Because of the little different between the amount of relief provided by steroidal and nonsteroidal epidural injections, doctors may have to consider other viable options to help patients avoid the side effects many steroids cause.

&quot;...Most of the short-term benefit seems to be not from the steroids, but from the local anesthetic and saline, which may &apos;calm&apos; inflamed nerves that send pain signals,&quot; said Dr. Steven P. Cohen, a professor of anesthesiology at Johns Hopkins. &quot;Doctors should consider significantly reducing the steroid dose, or even not using steroids in patients who are at high risk.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong>Doctors with a financial interest in magnetic resonance imaging (M.R.I.) machines may be more likely to order unnecessary scans for patients, according to a new <em>Radiology</em>&#xA0;study.</strong>

Researchers found that more patients received M.R.I. scans that indicate nothing is wrong if they are referred by a doctor who owns the machine. Of the 700 knee M.R.I. scans studied, 33 percent of patients indicating no abnormalities were referred by doctors who owned the machine, as compared with 25 percent of patients referred by those without a financial stake in the device.

&quot;There is a potential for bias in certain settings,&quot; said Dr. Matthew P. Lungren, the study&apos;s lead author and a fellow in radiology at Duke. &quot;The doctor should be transparent and acknowledge his interest. That should be disclosed.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>Location is one of the largest factors determining what medications are prescribed, particularly to seniors, according to a study released by the Dartmouth Atlas Project.</strong>

The differences in prescriptions nationwide mean that some patients miss out on key treatments while others get risky ones, according to the study. More than 1 in 4 Medicare patients filled at least one prescription for medications long deemed high-risk for seniors, including muscle relaxants and anxiety relievers that can cause excessive sedation, falls and other problems in older adults.

Researchers showed that the type and amount of health care patients receive varies widely nationwide, with those who live where Medicare spends more not necessarily receiving quality care. Patients in the South were more likely to fill prescriptions for riskier medications, but less likely than those in other regions to receive long-recommended treatments for heart and bone conditions.

Doctors &quot;really need to ask themselves, &apos;Is there a good reason why my patients are getting less effective care than patients in the other regions,&apos;&quot; said Dr. Jeffrey Munson, who believes there would be far less variation if doctors were following guidelines on best medication practices. Read the full article here:

<strong>Two top reproductive health organizations say the federal government is not doing enough to keep people safe from chemicals that cause a range of health problems, from birth defects to diabetes.</strong>

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) released a joint statement to raise awareness of some of the environmental threats that chemicals cause.

&quot;There is a backdrop of disease processes that have increased in the past 30-40 years,&quot; said Dr. Jeanne Conry, president of ACOG. &quot;In that backdrop we have seen an increase in the release of chemicals into the environment.&quot;

The statement calls for doctors to help patients reduce their exposure to chemicals, but just what those chemicals are is another matter altogether. Some of the chemicals mentioned, including mercury and lead, have been clearly shown to be harmful, while the evidence of bisphenol A and phthalates is less clear. Read the full article here:

<strong>Doctors must warn about chemicals, health groups say</strong>

The significant increase in birth defects and autism may be attributed to proliferation of chemicals in the world around us.

<strong>Following years of highly-publicized recalls on medical implants plagued by design and manufacturing flaws, a new electronic system will now be used to protect patients by catching problems earlier.&#xA0;</strong>

The Food and Drug Administration published new rules that require most medical devices sold in the U.S. - such as pacemakers and hip replacements - to carry a unique code used for tracking by federal health regulators. The make, manufacture date and lot number codes will be stored in a publicly accessible database to help regulators, doctors and companies monitor safety issues with devices.

&quot;Up until now medical devices were among the only products on the market that could not be uniquely identified,&quot; said Josh Rising, director of Pew Charitable Trusts&apos; medical device initiative. &quot;This is going to be a tremendous victory for all of those interested in improving the performance of devices.&quot;

Hospitals and insurers will be able to add the codes to patients&apos; medical records, helping them to quickly identify people who have received problematic implants and devices. Read the full details here:

The group&apos;s task force looked at scores of measure in five major categories - access to care, quality and patient safety, liability, injury prevention and disaster preparedness - and relied on data from the Centers for Disease Control and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, among others.

While the report does not measure the actual quality of care provided, it does offer a snapshot of national and state policies affecting emergency medicine as seen by providers. Kentucky is among the five states providing the worst emergency care. Read the full details here:

<strong>Drug-resistant germs, known as superbugs, infect more than two million people each year, 23,000 of which die from their infections, according to a recent NBC News article.</strong>

Although doctors have been warned of the problem for decades, up to half of prescriptions written for antibiotics are unnecessary, making the superbug problem even worse.

C. difficile is biggest killer by far, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and has become a scourge of hospitals. The infection is made possible when patients are heavily treated with antibiotics to fight other infections and can cause unstoppable diarrhea.

The most immediate problem is in hospitals and when patients do not finish a prescribed course of antibiotics. The CDC reported that no new antibiotics are in the immediate works that would kill any of these superbugs, meaning patients may have to be treated with older, more toxic drugs, or with cocktails of antibiotics that may cause side-effects.

&quot;If we are not careful, the medicine chest will be empty when we go there to look for a lifesaving antibiotic for somebody who has a deadly infection,&quot; sad CDC director Tom Frieden. &quot;Without care we will soon be in a post-antibiotic era. For some infections...we are already there.&quot; Read the full story here:

<strong>23,000 killed by superbugs in US each year, CDC says</strong>

<strong>All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes in order to reduce the risk of several potential birth complications, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.&#xA0;</strong>

The independent task force found an overall benefit to screening and treatment, including a reduced risk of preeclampsia in pregnant patients and of having an overly large baby and birth-related injuries to the newborn.

The group said women with no history of diabetes should be screened after 24 weeks of pregnancy.

About 240,000 of the 4 million women who give birth each year nationwide each year develop gestational diabetes, a condition on the rise as obesity and other risk factors increase among pregnant women. The condition occurs during pregnancy when the body does not produce enough insulin or use it correctly, leaving the body unable to convert starches and sugars from food into energy.

&quot;One of the key steps women can take to reduce the chances of gestational diabetes is having a healthy diet and being physically active prior to pregnancy,&quot; said Dr. Wanda Nicholson, a former member of the task force. Read the full story here:

<strong>A new study that found no logical explanation for the cost of having a baby in a hospital in California ranging from $3,000 to $37,000 highlights the &quot;appalling&quot; state of healthcare nationwide, according to a recent <em>NBC News </em>article.&#xA0;</strong>

Even after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, researchers found the prices for uncomplicated deliveries ranged from $3,296 to $37,227, while those for a C-section ranged from $8,312 to nearly $71,000.

&quot;It is very common, not just in California, but in every state and every city around the country,&quot; said Dr. Jeffrey Rice, a former physician who set up a group called Healthcare Blue Book to help people compare prices. &quot;Every hospital gets to set their own prices. They get to negotiate their payment amounts with the insurance companies.&quot;

The federal government started publishing data on hospital charges in May, with the first numbers confirming that charges vary enormously, and for seemingly unclear reasons.

&quot;The number one thing consumers can do is ask about the cost of care before they get treatment,&quot; said Rice. &quot;If a provider won&apos;t tell you what their price is, you probably don&apos;t want to do business with that provider.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong>What&apos;s it cost to have a baby? Try $3,000 --- or $37,000</strong>

Before you undergo an elective or non-urgent medical treatment or procedure, be sure to ask about the associated costs, even if you have insurance. The differences between providers and hospitals can be significant, even within the same city.

<strong>New recommendations by U.S. health regulators aim to limit the prescription of a commonly used drug, citing the risk of liver damage, according to a recent <em>NBC News </em>article.&#xA0;</strong>

Acetaminophen is widely used in both prescription and over-the-counter products to reduce pain and fever from acute injuries, post-operative pain, or pain following dental procedures. Limiting the quantity to less than 325 milligrams of acetaminophen per tablet, capsule, or other dosage unit will reduce the risk of inadvertent overdose, which can lead to liver failure, liver transplant and death, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

Inadvertent overdose from combination drugs containing acetaminophen accounts for nearly half of all cases of acetaminophen-related liver failure in the United States. The FDA also cited the fact that no available data showed that taking more than the recommended dose provided benefits that outweighed the added risks. Read the full story here:

<strong>FDA: Limit high-dose acetaminophen</strong>

Even Tylenol, if you take enough, can be harmful. Always take medications pursuant to how they are prescribed or, if over the counter, in accordance with the recommended dosage on the package.

<strong>Current widespread guidelines for blood pressure may be outdated, according to a report published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, which suggests that people over 60 can have a higher blood pressure before starting treatment to lower it.</strong>

Patients have been told to strive for blood pressures below 140/90, with some taking multiple drugs to achieve that goal, for more than 30 years. After five years of reviewing evidence, and weighing the risks associated with the medications used to bring pressures down, the guidelines committee concluded that the goal for people over 60 should be 150/90.

The group added that people over 60 who already take medications to lower blood pressure can continue if they are not experiencing side effects, but that there is a difference between lowering blood pressure with drugs and having lower pressure naturally.

&quot;We have this notion that if we can get blood pressure to normal, we will have the most health benefits,&quot; said Dr. Paul A. James, co-chairman of the guidelines committee. &quot;That&apos;s not necessarily true.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>A mammogram is the most basic test to screen for breast cancer, but differing guidelines in the medical community over when to begin testing has led to widespread confusion among patients, according to an <em>ABC News</em>&#xA0;article.&#xA0;</strong>

The United States Preventive Task Force recommends that women get mammograms starting at age 50, while the American Cancer Society advocates for screening to begin at age 40.

A new study contends that women have a baseline screening even earlier than the official guidelines, at age 35, because of the number of young women who develop the disease in their 20s and 30s.

Besides the discomfort associated with the test, there is a relatively small radiation exposure. False positives during testing can subject patients to biopsies that they otherwise&#xA0;would not have to have.

&quot;You have to look at the big picture,&quot; said Dr. V. Merle McIntosh, chief of breast surgery at Englewood Hospital. &quot;Do the benefits outweigh the risks of doing these tests? And for mammography, I would say a resounding yes. The benefits far outweigh those risks.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong>A deadly bacteria that was once confined to hospitals is now emerging in communities with fatal results, according to USA Today.&#xA0;</strong>

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a drug-defying bug that has proved more persistent than any other, causing much frustration as it spreads more widely. In recent years, new MRSA strains have reached far beyond hospitals to infect schoolchildren, soldiers, prison inmates, and NFL players.

MRSA infections sicken hundreds of thousands of Americans each year in various ways, from minor skin boils to deadly pneumonia, killing upward of 20,000. MRSA cases in children continue to rise 10% a year among youths ages 3 months to 17 years.

Modern medicine&apos;s struggle against antibiotic resistant bacteria has become the nation&apos;s most daunting public health threat.

&quot;Some of these bugs tend to come and go over decades, and the question now is what will happen with community-associated MRSA,&quot; said Bob Weinstein, an infectious disease physician for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System. &quot;How long will it be here before it wanes - or will it wane?

<strong>A widespread surgical technique used on thousands of women during hysterectomies is currently being debated after a Boston surgeon and his anesthesiologist wife blamed it for dangerously spreading her undetected cancer, according to the Boston Globe.</strong>

Morcellation, the technique in question, is typically employed during laparoscopic hysterectomies, a type of minimally invasive surgery. When a morcellator was used to cut Dr. Amy Reed&apos;s uterus, however, cancerous tissue spread throughout her abdominal cavity during the surgery, giving her stage 4 cancer.

Reed said the gynecologist at Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital who did her hysterectomy did not inform her of the risk that morcellation can spread cancer.

About 600,000 hysterectomies are done in the United States every year, most done to treat benign fibroids using minimally invasive techniques. Morcellation is not generally recommended for use in patients who are known to have cancer.

Reed&apos;s husband believes doctors and hospitals are still using the procedure because it allows them to do more procedures faster. &quot;There is a lot of money involved in this business,&quot; he said. Read the full article here:

Shoulder problems, physical imbalances, muscle tightness and reduced strength are among the health issues that breast cancer patients and survivors sometimes contend with, according to Susie Stewart, instructor of the class at Floyd Memorial Physical Therapy Charlestown Road. The American Cancer Society recommends cancer survivors get at least 150 minutes of exercise a week, with strength training at least two days a week.

<strong>Extended use of certain acid-suppressing drugs may be leading to an increase in anemia, neurological problems, or dementia, according to a new study published in&#xA0;<em>The Journal of the American Medical Association</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

People who use proton-pump inhibitors (P.P.I.&apos;s) and histamine 2 receptor antagonists, sold under brand names like Prevacid, Prilosec and Nexium, for two years or longer are at increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency which can, in turn, cause these health problems, according to the study. Last year, nearly 157 million prescriptions were written for P.P.I.&apos;s alone.

Out of more than 200,000 patients studied, those who took P.P.I.&apos;s for more than two years were 65 percent more likely to have a vitamin B12 deficiency, with higher doses more strongly associated with the vitamin deficiency.

<strong>Many male patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain are being denied treatment because of prohibitions placed on physicians by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.&#xA0;</em></strong>

On Sept. 12, the ABOG released a newly stringent and explicit statement of what its members could not do. Except for a few conditions, this restrictions include treating men. Failure to abide by this new rule could cause a physician to lose his or her board certification.

The board reversed its ruling to allow gynecologists to screen and treat men who are at high risk for anal cancer, but refuses to make an exception for pelvic pain, a condition poorly understood and frequently misdiagnosed in men.

According to the International Pelvic Pain Society, &quot;Gynecologists with the appropriate skills, experience and knowledge who choose to participate in the care of men with chronic pelvic pain should not be at risk of losing their board certification, solely because they participate in the care of patients who have a real need, suffer tremendously and have limited options for treatment.&quot; Read the full details here:

A recent trend of putting up medical barriers to stop GYN physicians from being able to help men, when they traditionally only treat women, must be torn down to effectuate and allow treatment for these chronic pain sufferers.

<strong>Prescription rates for powerful opioid pain pills that have high potential for abuse are high even for hospital patients who have not undergone surgery, according to a new study published in the Journal of Hospital Medicine.&#xA0;</strong>

More than 50 percent of patients studied who did not have surgery were prescribed an opioid, a type of narcotic painkiller including oxycodone and morphine, with over one-quarter of non-surgical patients still on the medications when they were discharged from the hospital, according to the report.

Overall, 43 percent of patients regardless of surgical status were given multiple opioid painkillers, with the average patient receiving about 68 milligrams of oral morphine daily.

&quot;Prior studies have found that higher opioid doses are associated with a heightened risk of adverse events,&quot; said Dr. Shoshana J. Herzig, a hospitalist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. &quot;Patients receiving doses of 100 mg per day or more are at substantially greater risk for serious problems, including severe breathing problems.&quot;

Painkiller abuse and addiction has been steadily on the rise over the last decade, with sixty percent of all drug overdose deaths linked to prescription medications in 2010. Since 2007, women have been at a higher risk of dying from a prescription drug overdose than from passing away in a motor vehicle accident. Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="Narcotic pain pill rates high for patients who don&apos;t have surgery: Study" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/narcotic-opioid-pain-pill-rates-high-for-patients-who-dont-have-surgery/" target="_blank">Narcotic pain pill rates high for patients who don&apos;t have surgery: Study</a></strong>

Pain relievers are essential and it only seems humane to prescribe opioids for those in significant pain. At the same time, these medications are not without risk. They can lead to breathing problems and death. From a long term perspective, they can lead to crippling drug addictions. If you can avoid opioids, do so. If you need them, take as little as possible for as short of a term as possible.

If you or anyone in your family has suffered serious side effects or damages from a medication error you should seek legal investigation immediately.&#xA0;Crandall &amp; Pera Law&#xA0;is&#xA0;available to help answer your questions and guide you in determining your next steps.

<strong>Pregnant women may have an increased risk of preterm delivery when exposed to a group of hormone-mimicking chemicals called phthalates, according to a new study in JAMA Pediatrics.</strong>

Women who were found to have the highest levels of phthalate metabolites in their urine had a risk of preterm birth - an infant born before 37 weeks of pregnancy - that was two to five times higher when compared with women with the lowest levels. Preterm birth is a leading cause of death or long-term neurological disabilities in children, with one out of every eight children born prematurely, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Women who has &quot;spontaneous preterm delivery,&quot; meaning they didn&apos;t have a medical condition that could explain their early delivery, made the link between exposure to phthalates and risk of preterm delivery even stronger for researchers.

Phthalates are chemicals widely used in making flexible and durable plastics, adhesives, detergents, soaps, shampoos, hair sprays, perfumes and deodorants. People are exposed through contact with products containing these hormone-disrupting chemicals and by eating certain processed and canned foods.

<strong>A new bill passed by Congress regarding stricter regulations for compounding pharmacies may actually be doing less to keep patients safer, according to ABC News.&#xA0;</strong>

The Drug Quality and Security Act was passed to prevent a repeat of what officials have called the &quot;largest documented healthcare-related outbreak in the United States,&quot; when a New England Compounding Center made tainted steroid injections that killed 64 people and sickened about 700 others in a fungal outbreak in 20 states last year.

The bill would give large-scale compounding pharmacies the option to register with the Food and Drug Administration and adhere to stricter guidelines for testing and maintaining quality and sterility.

Opponents of the bill fear compounding pharmacies will not be treated like other drug manufacturers who have to adhere to mandatory guidelines because the bill does not require them. Supporters hope that compounding pharmacists will want to register with the FDA because doctors will prefer to use manufacturers perceived as safer.

&quot;It makes no sense to have two different tiers of drug manufacturers -- one that has to meet all the manufacturing guidelines and one that only has to meet some of them,&quot; said Dr. Michael Carome, who directs the health research group at Public Citizen. &quot;We believe in a level playing field.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>An innovative experiment aiming to preserve the lungs of donors that die outside of a hospital could help ease the viable organ shortage nationwide, according to NBC News Health.</strong>

Currently, the U.S. does not have a system to recover organs quickly enough from registered organ donors who die unexpectedly, even though the air left inside lungs keep them from deteriorating right away as other organs do.

&quot;There aren&apos;t enough lungs. We&apos;re burying them,&quot; said Dr. Thomas Egan, who is leading the project. &quot;It turns out your lungs don&apos;t die when you do.&quot;

The new system would immediately notify next-of-kin upon the death of an organ donor for permission to participate in the research, pump air into the lungs to preserve them while the body is transported and a lung perfusion to preserve the lungs even longer while looking for abnormalities. Lungs that pass will be transplanted into patients willing to take a chance on these nontraditional organs, as part of the study funded by the National Institutes of Health.

In the United States, more than 6,000 people died in 2012 while waiting for new lungs as just 1,700 lungs transplants are performed each year. Only 15 to 20 percent of donated lungs are usable, often because complications during the donor&apos;s hospitalization damage them.

&quot;The general public does not understand how hard it is to become an organ donor,&quot; said bioethicist Arthur Caplan of New York University&apos;s Langone Medical Center. &quot;Only 2 to 3 percent of people die in circumstances that let them be organ donors.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>&apos;Lungs don&apos;t die when you do&apos;: New transplant program might ease shortages</strong>

The human body&#x2019;s resiliency is incredible. We now know that our lungs remain &#x201C;alive&#x201D; and viable hours after we die.

<strong>Delays in routine screening blood tests given to newborns to check for several dozen medical disorders are causing babies to die or become permanently disabled nationwide, according to a report in&#xA0;<em>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.&#xA0;</em></strong>

&quot;Heel prick&quot; tests have been performed for 50 years as a means to identify disorders in time to improve or save the lives of more than 12,000 newborns in the U.S. each year. &quot;The entire premise of newborn screening is to detect disorders quickly so babies can be treated early, averting death and preventing or limiting brain damage, disability and a lifetime of costly medical care,&quot; writes <em>Journal Sentinel</em>&#xA0;reporter Ellen Gabler.

Yet, at least 160,000 blood samples from newborns arrived late to labs across the country last year, according to analysis of tests from 31 states. As a result of this delayed lab work, many babies across the nation received delayed diagnoses of otherwise treatable illnesses.

<strong>Many high-risk devices that are widely used in the medical community have never been subjected to the rigorous premarket approval process the Food and Drug Administration routinely requires for new drugs, according to <em>The New York Times</em>.</strong>

Researchers fear that nearly a dozen medical devices, including external cardiac compressors, may never be thoroughly evaluated by the agency because they are presumed to be roughly equivalent to products already in use before the FDA began regulating devices in 1976.

These high-risk devices, meaning they sustain human life or pose an unreasonable risk to patients, include external pacemakers, access tubes implanted in blood vessels, a component of a lung device used for newborns, dental devices that are implanted near the brain, and screw systems used in spinal surgery. The FDA proposes downgrading the classification of these products so they are no longer considered high-risk instead of putting them through premarket approval.

&quot;People would be shocked to know that the FDA never got its act together to require the studies,&quot; said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women and Families. Other devices, including defribrillators and implanted pacemakers, will remain high-risk and must undergo premarket approval. Read the full details here:

Everybody wants to get potential life-saving products on the market as soon as possible.&#xA0; This desire, however, must be balanced by rigorous testing. Products that may seem perfect, often times are not.

New statistics show that Ohio is just about the deadliest state for infants, ranking 48th for infant deaths, according to <em>The Columbus Dispatch</em>.

In 2012, 1,045 babies died before their first birthday, according to state officials. This has led the push for new state bills that would provide $25 million for community-based services such as food or transportation, require more detailed documentation of sudden infant deaths, create an infant-mortality commission, and require parents to be given safe-sleep educational materials before leaving the hospital.

Gov. John Kasich has already funded several programs for pregnant women, including hormone treatment for those at risk of early delivery, smoking cessation classes and promotion of the use of multivitamins and folic-acid supplements.

&quot;Our infant health is truly a reflection of the health of our state in total,&quot; said Columbus Democrat Charleta B. Tavares, co-sponsor of the bills along with Springboro Republican Shannon Jones. &quot;So if we can&apos;t ensure that our babies live past one year of age, we cannot guarantee any other population in the state of Ohio that they are going to have a healthy life.&quot; Read the full details here:

Errors and violations continue to endanger nursing home residents across parts of Kentucky, according to inspections made by the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services.

State inspectors discovered five violations they believed placed the residents of the Masonic Home of Louisville in &quot;immediate jeopardy&quot; last year, including improper doses of medication and failing to ensure that medication errors were corrected.

The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services levied a $413,173 penalty on the Masonic Home, along with a $113,296 total penalty on seven other long-term care facilities in the area.

In fact, 45 of the 46 facilities in Jefferson County had at least one deficiency in 2013, according to Families for Better Care, a nonprofit advocacy group that produces an annual report card of the nation&apos;s nursing homes.

According to Families for Better Care&apos;s executive director Brian Lee, &quot;Nursing homes have a tendency to have a yo-yo [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][effect] where they clean things up for a short period of time.&quot;

The results of a long-term health trial which found no difference in death rates from breast cancer among women who had regular mammograms and those who did not may further confuse the actual necessary rate of these exams, according to <em>The New York Times</em>.

The annual mammogram has been promoted vociferously and continuously as an essential way to protect oneself from breast cancer for decades. But, in light of accumulating data in addition to this trial, the benefits of regular mammography may prove to be negligible for women when it leads to false positives and overtreatment.

Attitudes have been changing in terms of intensive screening for other types of cancer; the American Urological Association has loosened its prostate cancer screening guidelines for men because of the potential for unnecessary, invasive treatment that often leads to incontinence and impotence.

Patients and their doctors will face much more nuanced choices as the days of one-size-fits-all screening may be ending. Women may now face options based on each woman&apos;s risk for breast cancer and her feelings about the prospect of unnecessary treatment.

As Dr. Russell P. Harris, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, stated, &quot;The balance between benefits and harms is more and more up in the air.&quot; Read the full details here:

All we have heard for years is the importance of annual mammograms. Now there appears to be some disagreement on whether an annual mammogram is right for every woman. This is something all women should discuss with their gynecologists.

BODY:
Crandall &amp; Pera Law Attorney Steve Crandall recently won a significant victory for his client, Dr. Xiao Di and his wife Nan Qiao, in a medical malpractice case against the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and ophthalmologist Dr. Andrew Esposito.

On March 20, after just one day of deliberations, a Cuyahoga County jury found in favor of Dr. Di, a neurosurgeon formally employed by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and awarded him $7.7 million.

Back on Feb. 12, 2010, Dr. Di was performing surgery when he injured his left eye. Subsequent to that work-related injury, he underwent surgery to have his eye repaired. During that procedure, a hole was torn in Dr. Di&#x2019;s iris and his left pupil was destroyed due to the negligent actions of Dr. Esposito and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation medical team.

As a result of these injuries, Dr. Di is no longer able to operate as a neurosurgeon. After a 2 &#xBD; week trial, the jury awarded $7.7 million for the doctor&#x2019;s pain and suffering, loss of consortium and to replace prior and future lost wages. The case was heard by retired Cuyahoga County Judge Patrick Kelly.

Unfortunately for Dr. Di, his time in court may not be over. He is also party to an employment case against the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, challenging his termination.

A hospital in North Carolina exposed nearly 20 patients to an incurable brain disease after failing to properly sterilize surgical equipment, according to a recent<em>&#xA0;USA Today </em>article.

Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem apologized after exposing 18 neurosurgical patients to Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a degenerative fatal neurological disorder, after operating on a patient later confirmed to have the disease.

While the surgical equipment had been cleaned using typical sterilization procedures, they did not receive the enhanced procedures required for CJD.

It could take years if not decades for symptoms of the disease to show up, and there is no known cure. The disease has been associated with mad cow disease, although not the particular strain involved in this case.

&quot;We recognize that the risk to the patients is very small,&quot; said Jeff Lindsay, the hospital&apos;s president. &quot;However, we take any potential exposure seriously.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="20 exposed to incurable brain disease in N.C. hospital&#xA0;" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/11/creutzfeldt-jakob-exposure/5389547/" target="_blank">20 exposed to incurable brain disease in N.C. hospital</a></strong>

This is a tragic story about the lack of sterilization at a hospital affecting many people. This clear negligence may cause brain damage and wrongful death.

Doctors are researching a rare mutation so effective in preventing Type 2 diabetes that they are looking to mimic the mutation&apos;s effect in developing a new drug, according to a recent <em>New York Times</em>&#xA0;article.

The mutation destroys one copy of the gene ZnT8, which is used by pancreas cells where insulin is made, and reduces risk of Type 2 diabetes by two-thirds.

Those with the mutation seem to make slightly more insulin and have slightly lower blood glucose levels for their entire lives. Even older people with bad habits - overweight, drinking, smoking - seem to be protected from the disease when they have this mutation. Read the full details here:

A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics finds that using acetaminophen - the active ingredient in Tylenol and other common pain relievers - during pregnancy may not be as safe as women have been told.

According to the study, the children of women who took the drug during pregnancy were about 40% more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder than children of mothers who took none.

The probability of a child developing ADHD symptoms severe enough to require medication increased by 63% when his or her mother took acetaminophen during the last two trimesters of pregnancy and 28% when used in the third trimester alone.

The study underscores that, even when a medication is billed as safe, the safest route is for pregnant women to take it as rarely as possible and at the lowest effective dose, said UCLA obstetrician Dr. Daniel Kahn, a maternal-fetal health specialist who was not involved in the study. Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="Tylenol use during pregnancy linked to ADHD in kids, study finds" href="http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-tylenol-pregnancy-adhd-risk-20140224,0,2353473.story#axzz2uM9B40yQ" target="_self">Tylenol use during pregnancy linked to ADHD in kids, study finds</a></strong>

This is just another example of why pregnant women should be extremely careful about what medications they take. They should always consult their OB before taking a new medication, even if it can be bought over-the-counter.

If you or anyone in your family has suffered serious side effects or damages from a medication error you should seek legal investigation immediately.&#xA0;<a href="/Contact.shtml">Crandall &amp; Pera Law&#xA0;is&#xA0;available</a> to help answer your questions and guide you in determining your next steps.

Doctors are being warned not to intervene as quickly as currently suggested in births that involve epidural anesthesia, according to a recent study published in Obstetrics and Gynecology.

The study found that epidurals are associated with an even longer duration in the second stage of birth, the one in which women push, than is generally recognized, suggesting that some women may be subject to unnecessary interventions - including oxytocin, forceps, vacuum or a cesarean - by doctors who wrongly fear labor has become prolonged.

A normal second stage can take as long as 5.6 hours for women who get epidurals during their first births, and as long as 3.3 hours for those who do not get epidurals, according to the study.

Current guidelines by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists define an abnormally long second stage of birth as more than three hours for women who received an epidural and are giving birth for the first time, and more than two hours for first births without an epidural.

&quot;It&apos;s time to re-examine what normal and abnormal is, and revise our guidelines based on modern obstetric population,&quot; said Dr. Yvonne W. Cheng, the lead author of the study. Read the full details here:

A new research paper indicates lengthening the second stage of labor, the pushing phase. This may lead to longer labors and the possibility of brain damage, increases in cerebral palsy or other birth injuries. The lengthening of labor, this study believes, would not lead to such birth complications however.

Problems emerging during uterine surgeries undergone by over 50,000 women a year are increasing concerns among doctors regarding the safety of the procedure, according to recent studies in The Journal of the American Medical Association.

The procedure known as morcellation is used to either remove fibroid tumors from the uterus or to remove the entire uterus, cutting the tissue into pieces that can be pulled out through tiny incisions. The technique is part of minimally invasive surgery and used to shorten recovery time and reduce risks of blood loss, infection and other complications.

Morcellation can be performed by hand with a knife or with an electrical device with a rapidly spinning blade, the latter the cause of the most problems with the surgery. The technique can spray bits of uterine tissue or fibroids around inside the abdomen like seeds, sometimes causing pain, infection or bowel obstruction.

In a few cases, morcellation techniques have also injured abdominal organs and blood vessels and even spread hidden cancer cells through a patient&apos;s abdomen, causing advanced cancer.

About 498,000 women in the United States had hysterectomy operations to remove the uterus in 2010, about 11 percent of which involved morcellation, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

While Dr. Kimberly Kho, one of the study&apos;s authors, does not think the technique should be banned altogether, she does think doctors &quot;...could be more prudent and conservative with whom we use these instruments on and more systematic about preoperative evaluation to prevent morcellating detectable cancers.&quot; Read the full article here:

An Ohio nursing home with a history of taking on high-need patients is facing imminent shutdown after it was found, among other violations, to not be able to meet the needs of every resident, according to a recent article in <em>The Columbus Dispatch.</em>

Among the 130 people currently living at Carlton Manor in Fayette County, 27 are registered sex offenders. Diagnoses for high-need residents include schizophrenia, explosive personality disorder, traumatic brain injury, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, habitual cocaine use and suicidal.

As the state looks for new homes for the residents, it rekindles a debate over how to best achieve high-quality care for residents with violent backgrounds.

In Ohio, there is no special licensing or designation for nursing homes that care for violent residents, mentally ill patients or ex-cons. To keep its operating license, however, a nursing home must prove that it has the proper care plans and properly trained employees to handle every resident.

&quot;If a nursing home like Carlton Manor chooses to take on mental-health patients or criminal offenders, they can&apos;t say, &apos;We&apos;ll meet most of their needs,&apos; or &apos;We&apos;ll meet their needs on average.&apos; It has to meet the needs of every single resident,&quot; said Beverly Laubert, the Ohio Department of Aging&apos;s long-term-care ombudsman. &quot;And at Carlton Manor, that wasn&apos;t done.&quot; Read the full details here:

A new call to prevent and control infections in the medical workplace may mean an end to the doctor&apos;s white coat, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.&#xA0;</em>

The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America has issued guidance on what healthcare workers should wear outside of the operating room, suggesting hospitals to adopt a &quot;bare below the elbows&quot; policy that includes short sleeves and no wristwatch, jewelry or neckties during contact with patients in order to minimize infection risk.

The group also recommends that if the use of white coats is not entirely abandoned, each doctor should have at least two, worn alternately and laundered frequently, that they are encouraged to remove before approaching patients.

These recommendations, which are based on the biological plausibility of transmitting infection through clothing, are being suggested in addition methods already proven to reduce infection, including hand washing, bathing patients with antibacterial soap, and checklists for inserting intravenous lines.

&quot;Apparel should come next in level of concern,&quot; sad Dr. Gonzalo Bearman, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University. &quot;The more patients are aware that apparel may impact hospital infections, the more doctors will consider how clean they are.&quot; Read the full article here:

The &quot;white coat&quot; is a well known term for physicians given they usually wear one, especially in hospitals around the very sick. However, it has been unrecognized until recently these white coats may also carry and make infections worse through bacteria caught up in the fibers of the white coats.

Medical bills provided a financial burden for more than one out of four American families - 26.8 percent - in 2012, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Nearly 9 percent of families currently cannot make their medical bill payments, with a total of 16.5 percent facing financial issues stemming from medical costs in 2012. More than one-fifth of the 43,345 families surveyed were still paying off a medical bill that had been split into payments over time.

Not having health insurance was a big factor in not being able to pay off bills, but around one-fifth of the adults surveyed who had full insurance coverage still said it was difficult to pay bills.

&quot;Unpaid medical bills is the number one reason why families declare personal bankruptcy,&quot; said Karen Pollitz, a fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. &quot;It causes people to lose equity in their homes, to endanger their retirement and their kid&apos;s college education. It will destroy a family financially.&quot; Read the full details here:

Researchers have found that low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk for severe preeclampsia, a serious and sometimes fatal disorder of pregnancy, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times</em>.

Characteristics of preeclampsia include high blood pressure and excess protein in the urine.

Using over 3,700 blood samples of women at an average of 21 weeks gestation, researchers found that 717 had mild of severe preeclampsia. Women with vitamin D levels higher than 50 had a 40 percent reduction in relative risk for severe preeclampsia compared with those with levels under 50. There was no association of vitamin D level with mild preeclampsia.

&quot;Severe preeclampsia is rare,&quot; said Lisa M. Bodnar, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. &quot;And we can&apos;t determine whether low vitamin D causes it. Women should not run out to the drugstore and buy vitamin D supplements. If you&apos;re concerned, you should talk to your health care provider and continue to take your prenatal vitamins.&quot; Read the full article here:

New cholesterol guidelines released by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology may result in millions of people being unnecessarily given statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes, according to a recent article in <em>The Boston Globe</em>.

The treatment recommendations released by the two heart organizations have come under fierce criticism for overestimating the number of people predicted to have a 10-year risk or having a heart attack or stroke by 75 to 150 percent.

The treatment guide urges physicians to prescribe statins for patients between ages 40 and 75 whose 10-year-risk is 7.5 percent or greater.

&quot;It is possible that as many as 40 to 50 percent of the 33 million middle-aged Americans targeted by the new guidelines for statin therapy do not actually have risk thresholds exceeding the 7.5 percent level suggested for treatment,&quot; Dr. Paul Ridker and Nancy Cook, two heart researchers at the Brigham and Women&apos;s hospital, wrote in their commentary on the guidelines. Read the full details here:

<strong>A nationwide shortage of the intravenous solutions used to help rehydrate patients who are sick and help treat other conditions is concerning many health professionals, according to <em>CBS News</em>.</strong>

Millions of bags of IV solution are used each week, and increased used by hospitals - potentially from this year&apos;s flu season - have led to a lack of supplies, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

As of Jan. 17, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 40 states reported widespread flu virus infection. Though they don&apos;t track adult flu deaths, 20 children have died this season so far.

The shortage is causing the IV solutions to go for a much higher price; USA Today reports that a bag that would usually cost $1 to $1.25 is now going for five or six times the price.

Dozens of hospitals began reporting they were running out of IV fluids in mid-January, according to Valerie Jensen, associate director of the drug shortages program at the FDA. &quot;We know that hospitals are still reporting that they may only have a few days supply.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>Rear safety bars on semi-trailers are supposed to save your life, but WBNS-10TV in Columbus has found they are often too weak, corroded or bent to work effectively on many trucks throughout Ohio.&#xA0;</strong>

The guards are designed to keep a car from sliding underneath trailers in the event of a rear end impact at speeds of up to 30-35 miles per hour. But when they fail, the consequences can be catastrophic.

One of the main reasons these damaged bars are still on the road is a lack of enforcement; drivers and the owners of the semi-trucks they drive do not pay fines as a direct result of damages bars.

If the Ohio State Highway Patrol spots and notes a violation, the information is forwarded to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). Of 170 violations submitted to the PUCO in the past three years, none have directly resulted in a fine. PUCO only fines truck companies if their overall safety rating falls below a certain standard.

&quot;It seems like they&apos;re not taking care of that part of the truck,&quot; said semi driver Lester Marriott. &quot;And that&apos;s important because in a collision, that keeps a car from going under.&quot; Read the full details here:

The 13 acknowledged fatalities linked to defective ignition switches in General Motors cars may only be the beginning of the true death toll caused by the automaker, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The faulty switch can cause a sudden loss of engine power and deactivate air bags in Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and other small cars. G.M. began recalling 2.6 million cars only after 13 deaths and 32 accidents tied to this defect, even though the automaker knew of the problem as early as 2001.

G.M. has now recalled more than 13.5 million vehicles nationwide this year, as compared to nearly 758,000 recalls in 2013.

&quot;G.M. would be in the position to determine additional cases related directly to this defect based on lawsuits, incident claims and additional data reported directly to the automaker from its customers, dealerships, insurance companies, safety groups and other sources,&quot; said David Friedman, the acting chief of the N.H.T.S.A.

A link between prescription testosterone and a potential increase in the risk of heart attacks has medical experts calling for more extensive warning labels on the drugs, according to a recent <em>New York Times </em>article.

A new study funded by the National Institutes of Health tracked about 56,000 older and middle-aged men around the country who were prescribed testosterone. Men 65 and older had double the rate of heart attacks in the months after starting the drug, as did those younger than 65 with a previous diagnosis of heart disease. There was no evidence of greater risk in the younger men without a history of heart problems.

Testosterone gels, patches, pellets and injections are widely marketed for symptoms of &quot;low T,&quot; including fatigue, low libido and loss of energy.

In November, a study in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that older men, many with a history of heart disease, had a nearly 30 percent increase in mortality, heart attacks and stroke after using testosterone. In 2009, a federally financed study intended to test whether testosterone gel could help elderly men build muscle and strength was halted early because of heart attacks and other cardiac problems in men using the drug.

Still, the drugs carry no mention of an increased risk on their labels or in advertising materials. Said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, a senior adviser to the Washington advocacy group Public Citizen, &quot;Given that there have been several studies now, I don&apos;t see how the Food and Drug Administration can justify having no warnings of heart attacks at all.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong><a title="New Concern About Testosterone and Heart Risks" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/study-adds-to-concern-about-cardiac-risks-for-older-men-taking-testosterone/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">New Concern About Testosterone and Heart Risks</a></strong>

Sometimes using prescriptions which would seem to help can also cause an increased risk of life threatening events to occur. To any man contemplating the use of testosterone, a stark warning has been issued.

Antidepressants taken during pregnancy, especially after 33 weeks, may increase the risk for both immediate and long-term lung problems in babies, according to a recent <em>CBS News</em>&#xA0;article.

The breathing problems, called persistent pulmonary hypertension, occur when high blood pressure in the lungs prevents oxygen from moving to the lungs through the rest of the body. Symptoms include rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing and a blue tint to the skin.

Canadian researchers pulled seven studies that looked at breathing difficulties in newborns associated with antidepressant use. The studies that met the researchers&apos; criteria looked at selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors antidepressants, or SSRIs, a commonly-prescribed class of the medication which includes drugs like Lexapro, Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil.

Researchers estimate the overall risk may still remain low, occurring in about 2.9 to 3.5 births per 1,000, but this might be the very first review looking at this breathing risk in children of antidepressant-takers.

&quot;Decisions on treatment needs to be personalized,&quot; said study author Dr. Sophie Grigoriadis. &quot;Women need to make informed decisions by taking in all the risks of depression and its treatments.&quot; Read the full article here:

A recent lawsuit filed by a woman accusing her doctor of forcing a C-section brings light to the fact that the U.S. performs more than three times the recommended rate of surgical births, according to <em>The New York Times</em>.

Although the patient in question wanted to give birth naturally, her doctor pressured her to have a C-section, even allegedly going so far as to tell her that she would be committing the equivalent of child abuse without one and that her baby would be taken away from her.

This lawsuit is part of the debate over the use of C-sections and the rights of pregnant women to control their own bodies. Nearly 33 percent of U.S. births - almost 1.3 million - were by cesarean section in 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization recommends that the rate should not be higher than 10 to 15 percent.

The increase in the number of C-sections has been attributed to a rise in high-risk pregnancies; a desire by doctors and mothers to schedule their deliveries; and fears of malpractice lawsuits should the baby be injured during a normal delivery, which typically takes far longer than a cesarean.

&quot;In my worldview, the right to refuse is uncircumscribed,&quot; said Dr. Howard Minkoff, chairman of obstetrics at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. &quot;I don&apos;t have a right to put a knife in your belly ever.&quot; Read the full article here:

The issue of patient choice, particularly in a woman&apos;s ability to choose her preferred method delivering her child, is a sensitive matter. While physicians must always consider what is medically best for a patient, they cannot force care upon someone.

Further investigation into the allegations of Department of Veterans Affairs administrators manipulating waiting lists at its Phoenix medical center show that 1,700 patients never received care, according to&#xA0;<em>The New York Times</em>.

The average waiting time for initial primary care appointments at the Phoenix VA medical center - 115 days - was nearly five times as long as what the hospital&apos;s administrators had reported. Irregularities in how the 1,700 veterans were handled mean that &quot;these veterans may never obtain a requested or required clinical appointment,&quot; according to the acting inspector general&apos;s report.

The inspector general also reported that the falsified data may have led to more favorable performance reviews for hospital personnel and that some instances of potentially manipulated data had been turned over to the Justice Department.

Similar kinds of manipulation to hide long and possibly growing waiting times are &quot;systemic throughout&quot; the VA health care system&apos;s 150 medical centers serving 8 million veterans each year. The inspector general&apos;s office is reviewing practices at 42 VA medical facilities. Read the full article here:

Medicaid patients experience more surgical complications and cost more than patients with private insurance, according to a recent study in the journal <em>JAMA Surgery</em>.

Of nearly 14,000 patients studied, Medicaid patients were twice as likely to smoke and had higher rates of conditions that made surgery riskier, even though they were generally younger than the privately insured patients. The unhealthy conditions included diabetes, lung disease and blood vessel blockage.

Medicaid patients had more emergency operations and used 50 percent more hospital resources than patients with private insurance. Medicaid patients were also found to typically need extra time in the hospital - three days on average - and were more likely to return after going home from surgery.

Most importantly, Medicaid patients had two-thirds more complications in the month after their operations and were more than twice as likely to die, compared with those on private insurance.

&quot;We supported the expansion of Medicaid because it means that we can get patients into medical care and get them into optimum shape for an operation,&quot; said Dr. Darrell A. Campbell Jr., chief medical officer of the University of Michigan Health System. &quot;Being a heavy smoker predisposes you to get pneumonia after an operation. For a diabetic, if blood sugar is out of control, that increases the chances of a wound infection after surgery. If we can address these issues preoperatively, we can cut down the problems we see after an operation.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="Poorer Health of Surgery patients on Medicaid May Alter Law&apos;s Bottom Line" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/us/poorer-health-of-surgery-patients-on-medicaid-may-alter-laws-bottom-line.html?ref=health&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Poorer Health of Surgery patients on Medicaid May Alter Law&apos;s Bottom Line</a></strong>

Not surprisingly, Medicaid patients have been found to be in poorer health than those who have private insurance. The ramifications of this reality will continue to add stress and additional cost to the health industry, hospitals and individual physicians who provide care for low government reimbursements.

Cervical cancer may affect many more women over age 65 than previously believed, which could drastically affect current medical guidelines, according to a recent <em>NBC News</em>&#xA0;article.

A rare but very deadly disease, cervical cancer is diagnosed in 12,000 U.S. women every year and kills 4,000. Many women over the age of 65 believe they no longer need gynecological exams, but a recent study shows that the rate of risk for cervical cancer for this age group is actually 83 percent higher than previously thought.

The problem lies in the fact that current guidelines do not take into account the high rate of hysterectomy in the U.S. Even though 20 percent of U.S. adult women cannot get cervical cancer because they have had a hysterectomy, they are still included in risk calculations, skewing the data. The actual rate of cervical cancer is almost 25 women per 100,000 women aged 65 to 69.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force and the American Cancer Society currently recommend against routine yearly testing, recommending instead that women aged 21 to 65 get either a Pap smear or a test for HPV every three years. Women over 65 who have had three &quot;clear&quot; screens in a row are told they don&apos;t need the test any more.

&quot;We traditionally thought that the higher risk was among middle-aged women,&quot; said Anne Rositch, an assistant professor of epidemiology and public heath at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. &quot;But when we redid the data we found that the rate of cervical cancer continued to increase up to the ages of 65-69.&quot; Read the full article here:

The Kentucky State Police is aiming to keep the state&apos;s roadways safer by cracking down on one of the leading causes of semi-truck and commercial vehicle accidents: brake failure.

The KSP Commercial Vehicle Enforcement division conducted 95 inspections and issued 130 citations in a 24-hour nationwide inspection campaign earlier this month.

&quot;About 50 percent of the ones we found are brake related, usually with brake pads wearing too thin,&quot; said SP officer Harold Mosley. &quot;With commercial vehicles, they have to adjust their brakes, if they don&apos;t adjust them they can be rendered completely inoperative and not work at all.&quot;

Commercial vehicles are involved in 90 plus fatalities - approximately 9% of all traffic fatalities - in Kentucky each year. Read the full details here:

As technology continues to advance, the current practice of the virtual house call may be the future of doctor-patient relationships, according to a recent article on Boston.com.

Communicating with patients via webcam is increasingly getting attention as a way to conveniently diagnose simple maladies, such as the cold or flu. One smartphone app lets consumers connect to a doctor for $49 a visit.

Some are calling this the future of medicine, but some states still restrict the kind of care and prescribing available via telemedicine, especially since doctors who practice by video-chat must be licensed in whatever states their long-distance patients live. While Medicare currently covers some forms of telehealth, it typically does not pay for in-home video exams.

There are other questions as well, including how to avoid overprescribing antibiotics.

Despite these hurdles, patient groups and technology advocates are pushing to expand the digital are to people with complex chronic diseases that make a doctor&apos;s trip more than just an inconvenience.

&quot;Think of taking your mom with Alzheimer&apos;s to a big urban medical center,&quot; said Dr. Ray Dorsey, a neurologist at the University&#xA0;of Rochester Medical Center. &quot;Just getting through the parking lot they&apos;re disoriented. That&apos;s the standard of care but is it what we should be doing?&quot; Read the full article here:

The joint effort of the Ohio State Highway Patrol and Pennsylvania State Police Commercial Enforcement sections will be to increase awareness, enforce and inspect commercial vehicles committing crash-causing violations, such as following too closely and unsafe speed.

The target enforcement area along Interstate 80 will allow the two agencies to communicate across the state line about potentially dangerous trucks. They will also coordinate target safety enforcement times and random safety inspections.

In addition to overweight loads and speeding, higher-level inspections will look deeper for hidden problems, including mechanical failure or brake wear.

Some Veteran Affairs clinics have been found to falsify records amid allegations that dozens of patients have died because of delays in medical treatments, according to a recent <em>USA Today </em>article.

Clerks at the Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in Fort Collins, Colorado were instructed to falsify appointment records so it appeared the small staff of doctors was seeing patients within the agency&apos;s goal of 14 days, according to the VA investigation. In reality, many of the 6,300 veterans treated at the outpatient clinic waited months to be seen.

Department officials revealed last month that 23 deaths of veterans were linked to delay cancer screenings dating back four years. A retired doctor recently alleged that 40 other veterans died at a VA hospital in Phoenix due to treatment delays.

Of the 9 million veterans the VA treats a year, the agency found that only 41% are seen within 14 days, down from 90% reported in 2012 under an old, now-abandoned measurement method. Read the full details here:

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder diagnoses are increasingly rampant among children in the state of Kentucky, nearly double the national average, according to a recent article in <em>The Courier-Journal</em>.

The latest statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show 19 percent of Kentucky children ages 4-17 have been diagnosed with ADHD at some point, the highest state percentage in the nation. The national average is 11 percent.

ADHD levels have risen steeply in the past decade nationwide, with 6 million children diagnosed at some point in their lives.

The reason for the increase in diagnoses is unclear. Some say overworked primary care doctors who aren&apos;t experts in the disorder may be over-diagnosing - and possibly over-prescribing - both locally and nationwide. Others theorize the numbers in Kentucky could be linked to rampant poverty or that children statewide may be genetically prone to the disorder.

&quot;We&apos;re probably over-diagnosing it to a certain extent,&quot; said Dr. Christopher Peters, a psychiatrist and assistant professor in the University of Louisville&apos;s pediatrics department. &quot;But these numbers indicate a problem. There are many kids in need.&quot; Read the full details here:

The Kentucky Court of Appeals has unfortunately given guardians of nursing home residents the power to bind the resident to arbitration and deprive them of their constitutional right to a jury trial.

Wright</a>, is as follows:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Defendant Ginger Wright was appointed legal guardian for Mable Damron.&#xA0; Three years later, Damron became a resident of a long-term care facility (the &#x201C;Facility&#x201D;).&#xA0; As guardian, Wright executed all admission documents on Damron&#x2019;s behalf, including an optional agreement requiring the parties to the contract to arbitrate any disputes or claims against the Facility or its related entities.&#xA0; The arbitration agreement explicitly stated that the parties understood they were waiving their constitutional right to a jury trial.&#xA0;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Wright subsequently filed a complaint for medical malpractice, negligence, corporate negligence, and violations of statutory duties against the Facility and various affiliated companies.&#xA0; The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to stay the action and compel arbitration as provided by the agreement.&#xA0; Wright responded that the agreement was unenforceable on several grounds, including that she lacked the authority to execute any agreement which waived Damron&#x2019;s right to a jury trial.&#xA0; The trial court agreed, asserting that a guardian does not have the authority to waive her ward&#x2019;s right to trial by jury.&#xA0;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a court-appointed guardian has the authority to execute an arbitration agreement with a nursing home on behalf of her ward.&#xA0; It explained that the &#x201C;best interests&#x201D; of the ward in this situation must be informed by the legislative policies expressed in the federal and state arbitration acts. Wright did not waive Damron&#x2019;s right to bring claims against the Facility and related entities&#x2014;she only specified a forum where those claims must be argued.&#xA0; Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court&#x2019;s order. &#xA0;</em><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
Crandall &amp; Pera Law recommends that when offered binding arbitration during the admission process, just say no thanks. In order for the arbitration agreement to be enforceable, it must be an OPTION, not a requirement for admission. Again, just say no.

Eight million people signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act&apos;s six-month enrollment period, but many Americans remain voluntarily uninsured, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.</em>

Cost is a major factor for people who have decided to stay uninsured despite the law&apos;s requirement that most Americans get coverage this year or pay an income tax penalty of $95 or more.

Many people either do not qualify for federal subsidies or believe that the assistance is not enough to make insurance affordable, according to experts. Other facts for not enrolling include objections to the government&apos;s requiring it and feelings by some people that they simply do not need it.

People who have gone without health insurance or major illness for years can be especially resistant to investing in coverage, according to enrollment counselors. These people represent the next challenge for the Obama administration as it struggles to reduce the ranks of the uninsured and broaden support for the president&apos;s signature health care law.

Primary care physicians and specialists&#xA0;worried about changes in the health care market are streaming into salaried jobs with hospitals, almost certainly causing more expensive heathcare in the short run, according to <em>The New York Times</em>.

While health economists agree the U.S. should move away from the traditional system of fee-for-service payments, where private positions are paid for each procedure and test, the change from private practice to salaried jobs may not yield better or cheaper care for patients. The current system drives up the nation&apos;s $2.7 trillion health care bill by rewarding overuse.

Many doctors on salary are offered bonuses tied to how much billing they generate, which could encourage physicians to order more X-rays and tests, according to Mark E. Smith, president of Merritt Hawkins, one of the nation&apos;s leading physician placement firms. Tests formerly performed in a private office may now also cost far more because of an additional hospital &quot;facility fee&quot; that is tacked on.

Today, about 60 percent of family doctors and pediatricians, 50 percent of surgeons and 25 percent of surgical subspecialists &#x2014; such as ophthalmologists and ear, nose and throat surgeons &#x2014; are employees rather than independent, according to the American Medical Association.

&quot;From the hospital end there&apos;s a big feeding frenzy, a lot of bidding going on to bring in doctors,&quot; said Robert Mechanic, an economist who studies health care at Brandeis University. &quot;And physicians are going in so they don&apos;t have to worry - there&apos;s a lot of uncertainty about how health reform is going to play out.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong><a title="Apprehensive, Many Doctors Shift to Jobs With Salaries&#xA0;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/us/salaried-doctors-may-not-lead-to-cheaper-health-care.html?ref=health" target="_blank">Apprehensive, Many Doctors Shift to Jobs With Salaries</a></strong>

Many people assume the doctors they see at the hospital are employees of that hospital. This was usually not the case, but now is becoming more and more common. In the next five years, most doctors will be employed by hospitals. Whether this is good for patient care or the cost of that care remains to be seen.

<strong>Stroke survivors often resume driving without being formally evaluated, even after their&#xA0;ability to speak, think, see and control the body has been affected,&#xA0;according to new research presented at the&#xA0;American Stroke Association&apos;s International Stroke Conference.</strong>

Fewer than 6 percent of stroke survivors said they received a formal driving evaluation in the new survey, yet more than 51 percent returned to driving, many of them a month after suffering a stroke. Of those who took to the road, 31 percent reported that their strokes had &quot;some effect&quot; on basic activities of daily living, such as feeding, bathing and dressing oneself. Eleven percent reported the stroke had &quot;great effect.&quot;

&quot;Given the severity of stroke for some of these patients, it really surprised me that they would actually be able to get behind the wheel,&quot; said Dr. Shelly Ozark, a professor of neurology at the Medical University of South Carolina.&#xA0;&quot;There basically isn&apos;t anything on the books in the majority of states that demands people get retested in their driving abilities following a major health event such as stroke.&quot; Read the full details here:

It is frightening to think that stroke survivors who have difficulties with activities of daily living, such as feeding or bathing, are permitted to get behind the wheel of a car without an evaluation to determine whether they can safely drive.

America&apos;s prescription drug epidemic reaches deep into the medical community, producing enormous risks not only for the individuals, but the patients who trust in their care, according to a recent <em>USA Today</em>&#xA0;article.

More than 100,000 doctors, nurses, and other health professionals nationwide currently struggle with abuse or addiction, mostly involving narcotics such as oxycodone and fentanyl.

For every worst-case scenario - including three hepatitis outbreaks since 2009 caused by a health care worker using patients&apos; syringes - there are countless more practitioners whose drug-related errors are more isolated. &quot;Much of the damage goes unnoticed or undocumented; oversight mechanisms to detect, report and address drug problems in health care settings are haphazard and limited,&quot; states the article.

&quot;The medical community thinks it&apos;s immune from this disease, but that&apos;s not true,&quot; said Anita Bertrand, a Houston nurse anesthetist who became addicted to pain medication following an abdominal surgery. &quot;There are so many practitioners working impaired and we have no idea. ...We&apos;re doing a terrible job addressing this problem.&quot; Read the full story here:

Doctors and nurses are not immune to drug abuse,&#xA0;but unfortunately&#xA0;they&#xA0;provide care and treatment to patients while under the influence of their&#xA0;addiction.

<strong>General Motors has recalled about 4.8 million vehicles in the U.S. during the first three months of the year, already about six times the number of vehicles it recalled in all of 2013.&#xA0;</strong>

This year&#x2019;s recalls involve many of G.M.&#x2019;s most popular and best-known models due to&#xA0;a loose fitting for the transmission&#x2019;s oil cooler line which could allow oil leaks and possibly lead to fires and problems with the&#xA0;right-front axle half-shaft which could cut power to the front wheels.

A recent recall of&#xA0;490,000 trucks and 172,000 compact cars includes the&#xA0;2014&#xA0;Chevrolet Silverado 1500&#xA0;and&#xA0;GMC Sierra 1500&#xA0;pickups, the 2015&#xA0;Chevrolet Suburban&#xA0;and Tahoe, the&#xA0;GMC Yukon&#xA0;and Yukon XL with six-speed automatic transmissions, and the&#xA0;2013-14 Cruze models with 1.4 liter four-cylinder engines.

A once promising treatment for severe high blood pressure has proven&#xA0;ineffective in a recent study published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine.&#xA0;</em>

In the United States, 67 million people have high blood pressure. The treatment, called renal denervation, involves threading a tube through blood vessels into the renal arteries and zapping them with radio-frequency energy.

Although previous case reports and studies found astounding drops in blood pressure through renal denervation, the latest study on the treatment shows no significant difference in drops in blood pressure between a group who received the treatment and a group who only thought they were receiving it.

&quot;I think many people were anticipating there would be some degree of reduction and will be surprised there wasn&apos;t anything,&quot; said Dr. Deepak L. Bhatt, one of the study&apos;s authors. Read the full details here:

A new procedure which was devised to combat high blood pressure for those whom traditional medication does not work appears to not work well also. This invasive procedure proved to be no more useful than no procedure at all, meaning medication and life style changes remain the mainstay treatment for those with hypertension.

The U.S. and 26 other countries have begun a new effort to prevent and fight outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases before they spread around the globe, according to <em>NBC News.&#xA0;</em>

The Global Health Security Agenda will bolster local disease monitoring, develop tests for different pathogens and help regions create and strengthen systems to report and respond to public health emergencies.

Currently, over 80 percent of countries lack the health infrastructure necessary to spot a new infection rapidly and sound the alarm before it has time to gain a foothold and even spread into other countries.

Infectious diseases continue to be a growing concern with a new type of bird flu reported in China, a mysterious and deadly respiratory virus emerging in the Middle East, and the first appearance of a mosquito-borne virus in the Caribbean in the past year alone.

Germs &quot;do not recognize or stop at national borders,&quot; said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. &quot;A threat anywhere is indeed a threat everywhere.&quot; Read the full story here:

Women may be at a higher risk for blood clots for at least 12 weeks after they give birth, doubling the amount of time that was previously thought, according to <em>CBS News</em>.

Blood clots can cause life-threatening conditions, including strokes and heart attacks, due to blocking blood flow to the brain and heart. The blood clot can also get stuck in the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism or block blood flow to other organs, causing deep vein thrombosis.

Researchers determined that there was an almost 11 times higher risk of blood clots between zero to six weeks after giving birth, dropping to a little over twice as high during weeks seven through 12. One out of 10,000 women had a pregnancy-related blood clot 6-12 weeks after the baby was born.

New mothers should contact a medical professional immediately if they experience chest pain or pressure, problems with breathing, swelling or pain in one leg, severe and sudden headache or immediate loss of speech, vision, balance or strength on one side of the body.

&quot;Sometimes there&apos;s the notion that once they deliver they don&apos;t have to worry about these things,&quot; said Dr. Andrew Stemer, a Georgetown University neurologist. Read the full details here:

Prescription drug abuse is not only a continuing plague nationwide, but could also be a gateway for increased heroin use, according to a recent <em>NBC News</em>&#xA0;article.

There has been a roughly 20 percent increase in overdose deaths involving prescription painkillers since 2006, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&quot;The pathway appears to be now moving from the prescription drugs to heroin, a very dangerous development,&quot; said Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

The White House Office of National Drug control policy stated that many heroin users today appear to have gotten their start taking prescription pain drugs. Opioid prescription painkillers have the same effect on the brain and body as heroin does, causing physical addiction.

Health insurance companies must now cover substance abuse treatment under provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Read the full story here:

The abuse of prescription pain killers and heroin has been a problem for a long time. Many of these abusers start out as innocent victims of negligence that causes unrelenting pain. Painkillers should be used as a last resort and thrown out as soon as possible.

<strong>Taking the time to select the right nursing home is one of the most important steps families can take for the 1.4 million residents currently living in these often-feared institutional settings, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.&#xA0;</em></strong>

When paid for privately, the average cost for nursing home care ranges from $10,000 to $15,000 a month. Medicare does not pay for long-term nursing home care, only temporary skilled care, usually in the rehabilitation section of the home.

Finding the right facility is similar to shopping for a new car - it requires considerable preparation to become an educated consumer, writes Joanna R. Leefer in &quot;Almost Like Home,&quot; a user-friendly guide to choosing a nursing home.

&quot;The biggest mistake people make is waiting until the last minute, when faced with a crisis, to find a suitable facility,&quot; said Leefer. &quot;You&apos;re forced into an impulsive decision that you&apos;re not likely to be happy with unless you&apos;re really very lucky.&quot;

Once the family member is admitted, it is also critical to monitor their care. Check for any hints of physical abuse and signs of incipent or existing bed sores, which can become infected and hasten death. Read the full article here:

<strong><a title="Nursing Home Unthinkable? Be Prepared in Case It&apos;s Inevitable&#xA0;" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/nursing-home-unthinkable-be-prepared-in-case-its-inevitable/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;ref=health&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Nursing Home Unthinkable? Be Prepared in Case It&apos;s Inevitable</a>&#xA0;</strong>

The nursing home population is continuing to increase and will so more now that baby boomers are entering the age where such an institution may be necessary. The influx of patients will lead to a further increase in nursing home negligence, wrongful death and over medication cases as well.

<strong>Although improved cancer treatments and screenings have helped children and older adults live longer over the last 30 years, teens and young adults with cancer have not experienced the same rates of survival, according to a recent <em>CBS News</em>&#xA0;article.&#xA0;&#xA0;</strong>

Since 1975, cancer survival rates for children 14 and under have increased by 25 percent, with adults over 40 seeing a nearly 20 percent gain over the same time period. Cancer patients aged 15 to 19, meanwhile, had survival rates that increased by about 17 percent while survival rates among 20 to 39 year olds increased by only about 13 percent.

To address the gap for this &quot;forgotten population,&quot; the &#xA0;UCLA Medical Center launched once of the first cancer programs in the country offering patients a team of experts, including psychiatrists and social workers, who specialize in treating the needs of teens.

&quot;What we need to do is really concentrate on this population...developing clinical trials and new therapeutics specifically for these patients,&quot; said Dr. Noah Federman, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist at UCLA&apos;s Daltrey/Townshend Teen &amp; Young Adult Cancer Program. &quot;This becomes a home for them...that&apos;s very important to getting through this emotionally&#xA0;and mentally, which then helps them physically.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong>Scaling back use of a costly medicine given mostly to premature babies has caused a clash between the drug&apos;s manufacturer and the nation&apos;s leading pediatrician&apos;s group, according to a recent <em>CBS News </em>article.</strong>

The drug, sold under the brand name Synagis, guards against a common but usually mild virus that can cause serious lung problems.

New guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics say medical evidence shows the drug benefits few children other than very young preemies. Its new guidance recommends it only for infants born before 29 weeks, older preemies with chronic lung disease and those with certain heart problems, and certain other at-risk children younger than age 2.

Studies show the drug can slightly reduce risks for being hospitalized but doesn&apos;t shorten hospital stays or lessen chances for long-term complications or death. Advances in treatment for preemies in recent years make Synagis unnecessary for many, the academy says.

Since the drug has seen a 19 percent drop in sales over the first quarter in 2014, MedImmune and its parent company AstraZeneca have placed full-page ads in <em>The New York Times</em>&#xA0;and several other newspapers protesting pediatricians&apos; new recommended limits.

Yet another example of insurance companies attempting to practice medicine and exert control over care and medicine their insureds need. Until insurance companies are held in check, the health care system will continue to spiral out of control.

<strong>With&#xA0;over two million tractor-trailers on the road every day, Kentucky&apos;s Commercial Vehicle Enforcement division is working to prevent traffic accidents that could cause&#xA0;serious physical injury and property damage.</strong>

The division protects the state&apos;s infrastructure and enforces state and federal laws on commercial vehicles traveling Kentucky&apos;s roads.

In addition to inspections based at weigh stations, which see nearly 6,000 commercial vehicles roll through every day, sworn CVE officers travel the state&apos;s highways and interstates looking for traffic violators or anything else amiss on commercial vehicles. Unlike other law enforcement officers, CVE officers do not have to have probable cause to stop a commercial vehicle.

Drivers must have a medical examiner&apos;s certificate that shows they are physically capable of operating a truck, a commercial driver&apos;s license, shipping papers, inspection certificates and other supporting documentation. CVE officers also check that everything from brakes, lights, horn and steering axles are working properly and that the truck&apos;s tires are not flat.

Some violations can result in a truck being impounded, while others can result in federal fines in the thousands of dollars.

&quot;Safety is the utmost concern,&quot; said Officer Jared Newberry, spokesman of Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Region 2. &quot;The second concern is the infrastructure...We don&apos;t want several noncompliant companies damaging our bridges and highways.&quot; Read the full details here:

Commercial trucks are the single largest cause of devastating injuries on America&apos;s highways. &#xA0; Regulations and enforcement, along with damages awarded in personal injury lawsuits, are the only deterrent the industry will respond to.

<strong>Despite the risk of fewer complications and less pain, U.S. hospitals are not using minimally invasive surgeries as often as they should, according to a study reported in a recent <em>NBC News </em>article.</strong>

A survey of 1,051 U.S. hospitals in 45 states found that while 71 percent used minimally invasive surgery to take out an appendix, only 28 percent to take out part of the colon, even though keyhole colon surgery has about a third the complication rate of open surgery. Additionally, only&#xA0;13 percent used the same approach for a hysterectomy&#xA0;and 32 percent to remove part of a diseased lung.

Urban hospitals are more likely to use techniques that involve small incisions, leading to less pain, fewer complications and smaller scars, than rural hospitals.

&quot;This disparity may be due to the broad range of surgical services some surgeons in rural areas are required to provide and a scarcity of surgical specialists in such areas with advanced skills in minimally invasive surgery,&quot; the study&apos;s doctors wrote in their report, published in the British Medical Journal. Read the full article here:

<strong><a title="Hospitals Underusing Keyhole Surgery, Study Finds" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hospitals-underusing-keyhole-surgery-study-finds-n151071" target="_blank">Hospitals Underusing Keyhole Surgery, Study Finds</a></strong>

It is disappointing to see that physicians aren&apos;t using minimally invasive surgery more often even though the complication rate is less than the more invasive, traditional surgery.&#xA0;It is also disappointing to see that people who seek care in rural areas frequently seem to get poorer care than those in urban areas.

<strong>Placing hidden cameras inside nursing homes may seem extreme, but at one Ohio facility the act led to catching numerous criminal activities, according to Attorney General Mike DeWine&apos;s office.</strong>

Thirty-nine criminal charges have been filed against Autumn Health Care in Zanesville after relatives or residents began complaining to authorities in December 2012. The relatives allowed hidden cameras to be placed in certain rooms, and these allegedly captured footage of staff providing poor care and falsifying information.

The owner of the facility faces charges of corruption, Medicaid fraud and forgery, and an additional 16 charges have been brought against the facility as a whole. Read the full details here:

Should all patients in nursing homes be given the option of having cameras placed in the room? It may limit privacy but would likely increase the quality of care.

<strong>The cost of health care does not serve the&#xA0;only sticker shock in the medical industry - some generic drugs have recently seen price increases of over 1,000 percent, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times</em>.</strong>

Digoxin, a generic heart medicine prescribed for over 200 years, has seen its prices tripled over the last 10 months alone, with some patients now encountering costs of more than $1,000 plus hundreds of dollars in co-pays.

There has been no shortage of the drug to explain the increase in cost, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Digoxin is not hard to make and there have been no new patents or formulations. The only factor affecting the cost are company strategies intended to reap the benefits of selling an ancient, lifesaving drug.

In January, the National Community Pharmacists Association called for a congressional hearing on generic drug prices, complaining that those for many essential medicines grew as much as &quot;600, 1,000 percent or more&quot; in recent years. The price jumps especially affect smaller pharmacies who are unable to bargain for discounts.

One of the major fears of these steep price increases is that patients will stop filling prescriptions altogether for these drugs that are potentially saving their lives. Read the full article here:

Cost motivates many decisions; however, it is particularly disturbing to see the cost of medicines raised for no good reason and then see people not get the treatment they need.

<strong>More people have been diagnosed with mumps in Ohio in 2014 than in the entire United States last year, according to a recent <em>NBC News </em>article.</strong>

Health officials say there have been 439 cases statewide of the contagious infection as of June 24, as opposed to 438 in the entire country in 2013. More than 800 cases have been reported from 25 states so far this year.

Mumps is one of the infections prevented by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which continues to be less than perfect, according to health officials.

&quot;Mumps is a problem because the mumps vaccine that we have is a good one, but it is not a perfect vaccine,&quot; says Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. &quot;Even after two doses of mumps vaccine, if you wait 10 or 15 years and you&apos;re exposed to mumps there is only about 85 percent protection.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong>Vials of the smallpox virus found at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland are raising questions over how they went unnoticed for so long, according to a recent <em>CBS News</em>&#xA0;article.</strong>

Six glass vials were found to contain smallpox DNA, although health officials are still unsure if the samples are live and potentially dangerous. The startling discovery of the vials by a researcher at the NIH required a multi-agency response from the CDC, FDA, World Health Organization, FBI, and White House National Security Council as smallpox is a potential bioterrorism agent.

Since being eradicated in 1980, samples of the virus are only permitted in two high-security labs in the world - the CDC and the State Research Centre of Virology &amp; Biotechnology in Russia.

Dr. Stephan Monroe, deputy director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the CDC said it was &quot;one of those flukes&quot; that&#xA0;the vials went unnoticed. &quot;Certainly one of the lessons learned from this episode is that laboratories around the world should have a firm idea of what they have in their collections and...should make an effort to do a complete inventory.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong>The dangerous consequences of sports-related blows to the head include many long-term and debilitating burdens, as described by many former athletes and detailed in a recent <em>CBS News </em>article.</strong>

All too often young athletes feel they are invincible and immune to any sort of long-term injury. But several ailments - such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive neurodegenerative disease - can emerge from repeated blows to the head and concussions.

Many of the symptoms linked to CTE, including memory loss and cognitive decline and changes in moods and behavior, are related to symptoms of Alzheimer&apos;s, Parkinson&apos;s disease, and Lou Gehrig&apos;s disease. In fact, people who suffer repeated and traumatic brain injury are statistically at higher risk for developing these neurodegenerative conditions later in life.

&quot;...I lied about my symptoms for five weeks thinking I was doing the right thing,&quot; said Chris Nowinski, a former professional wrestler for World Wrestling Entertainment, who continued to compete despite persistent headaches. &quot;My ignorance cost me my career, cost me at least five years of my health with terrible post-concussion syndrome, and I don&apos;t know what it&apos;s going to cost me in the future. But CTE is what I fear most.&quot;

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as 3.8 million traumatic brain injuries occur each year from sports and recreational activities, and many people are still unaware of the acute symptoms associate with this injury. Read the full article here:

<strong>The organ transplant policy for pediatric patients is getting permanently tweaked thanks to a family&apos;s successful fight to get a lung transplant for their dying 10-year-old daughter last spring, according to <em>ABC News</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, which is under contract with the federal government to allocate organs, voted to allow children to be granted exceptions on a case-by-case basis to the so-called Under 12 Rule.

Normally, children under 12 who are waiting for a lung transplant are labeled &quot;priority 1&quot; or &quot;priority 2,&quot; and they get preferential treatment when child and adolescent lungs become available. Children younger than 12 only get offered adult lungs after they&apos;ve been offered to other matching candidates over 12 based on an algorithm called the LAS, or lung allocation score.

The family of Sarah Murnaghan fought the Under 12 Rule last year, claiming it was discriminatory because Sarah could be offered adult lungs only after they were offered to other matching adults. The OPTN created a temporary rule exception policy because of this case.

&quot;We know a lot of kids who are waiting and little people who are waiting,&quot; said Sarah&apos;s mother, Janet Murnaghan, at a news conference outside their Newtown Square, Pennsylvania home. &quot;Just knowing that they&apos;ll have greater access is a really amazing feeling.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>The state of Ohio ranks 44th nationwide when it comes to the quality of long-term services, including home care, support for family caregivers, and nursing homes, according to a new report.&#xA0;</strong>

The AARP, The Commonwealth Fund and The SCAN Foundation evaluated how every state fares in 26 indicators in five main areas that measure long-term services and supports for older adults and people with physical disabilities, and their caregivers. New indicators this year include length of stay in nursing homes and use of anti-psychotic drugs by nursing homes.

Ohio is in the bottom one-fourth of the country when it comes to affordability and access, and quality of life and quality of care. The state is in the third quartile in the areas of choice of setting and provider, support for family caregivers, and effective transitions.

The good news is that Ohio was one of five states with the largest rates of improvement - more than 25 percent - over its performance on the first report released in 2011. The report also showed that the median annual cost of care for a private room in a nursing home in the U.S. is $82,950.

&quot;Americans want to live independently in their homes and communities as they age,&quot; said AARP Senior Vice President for Public Policy Susan Reinhard. &quot;States are starting to step up to meet this challenge, but more must be done in a short time to meet the changing needs of a growing older population.&quot; Read the full details here:

Frightening findings as our population ages. This reinforces the notion that those who have loved ones in need of nursing home care must do exhaustive research to find a facility that is right for them.

<strong>For the first time, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended a specific brand of flu vaccine for kids aged 2 to 8 - the needle-free vaccine - according to NBC News.</strong>

The ACIP advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which can decide whether to take or leave the advice. ACIP members agreed on studies that show FluMist, which is squirted up the nose, is more effective than a shot in the arm for kids.

If the CDC approves of this recommendation, it will become official policy - although parents and pediatricians will be free to give any flu vaccine to a kid. Kids with egg allergies should continue to get the vaccines given as shots that are formulated without chicken eggs.

The CDC recommends that just about everyone get a flu vaccine every year. Read the full details here:

<strong>The results of two new medical studies may mean significant changes for how patients are monitored and treated following a stroke, according to <em>The New York Times</em>.&#xA0;&#xA0;</strong>

More than a half-million Americans every year have an ischemic stroke, the most common form, and at least a quarter of these cases have no apparent underlying cause. Atrial fibrillation, a common irregularity of the heartbeat that often goes unrecognized, may be causing up to a third of these strokes of unknown origin.

The findings of these studies are likely to encourage doctors to look more aggressively for signs of atrial fibrillation and prescribe more powerful anticoagulant medications to prevent clotting that can lead to additional strokes in these patients where a mild blood thinner is not enough.

Some patients may also need their hearts monitored much longer to detect abnormal rhythms. One of the studies found that atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in five times as many patients who wore special heart monitors for 30 days compared with those who underwent conventional 24-hour testing.

&quot;If more patients with atrial fibrillation can be detected, then more patients can receive appropriate stroke prevention therapy, and the hope is that more strokes, deaths, disability and dementia can be avoided,&quot; said Dr. David Gladstone, as associate professor in the department of medicine at the University of Toronto. Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="Longer Heart Monitoring Backed for Stroke Patients" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/longer-heart-monitoring-backed-for-stroke-patients/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;ref=health&amp;_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">Longer Heart Monitoring Backed for Stroke Patients</a></strong>

There is a strong correlation between many strokes and atrial fibrillation. If you or a loved one has A-fib, makes sure the doctor is taking precautions to prevent a possible stroke.&#xA0;Similarly, if you or a loved one has a stroke, make sure your doctor investigates whether you have atrial fibrillation.

<strong>New 3-D technologies may be able to improve the accuracy of breast cancer scans and resolve some of the controversy around screening, according to NBC News.</strong>

It has been argued that mammography could be doing more harm than good because of the many false positives that send women for biopsies of lesions that often turn out to be harmless.

The new screening method, as published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, resulted in 15 perfect fewer call-backs for additional imaging, while at the same time spotting more tiny, aggressive and potentially fatal tumors. The study suggests that doctors may one day be able to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions without the need for a biopsy.

&quot;It allows us to peel away the layers and see underlying lesions that might be obscured by other tissue,&quot; said Dr. Sarah Friedewald, co-medical director of the Caldwell Breast Center. &quot;You can think of regular mammography as showing a closed book. With 3-D you are able to page through the book one page at a time without other information superimposed.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong>As the negligent care of Veterans Affairs health facilities continues to be exposed nationwide, a local health center in Kentucky is finding that it is not in the clear either, according to <em>The Courier-Journal</em>.&#xA0;&#xA0;</strong>

Patricia Mahaun, a 26-year veteran of the Air Force, waited six months before she finally saw a doctor at the Louisville VA to get a possible urinary tract infection checked and get a flu shot. Stephen George, spokesman for U.S. Rep. John Yarmouth [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][KY-3] said his office has recently heard from about 20 veterans complaining about waits that lasted three or four weeks.

Judy Williams, spokeswoman for the Louisville VA, said she could not provide average wait times at local clinics or say how many complaints the agency has received concerning waits. Louisville&apos;s VA serves more than 150,000 veterans living in a 35-county area in Kentuckiana.

The VA cares for about 6.5 million veterans and other beneficiaries in its 150 medical centers and 820 community-based outpatient clinics nationwide. In April, a national report pointed to screenings delays that prevented prompt detection of possible gastrointestinal cancer in 76 veterans at VA hospitals and 23 related deaths.

&quot;Medical care delayed is medical care denied,&quot; said Mahaun. &quot;If I am experiencing this inexcusable delay, how many others in the Louisville area and beyond are also? It&apos;s high time that we start treating veterans like the heroes that the public claims we are.&quot; Read the full article here:

Yet another example of poor and negligent care offered by the VA to our veterans. Delays in treatment lead to malpractice, wrongful death and missed diagnoses, as well as medication errors and other mistakes that cost pain and suffering and millions of dollars in additional care.

<strong>As the trend of hospital systems buying health insurance companies continues, reports show that patients may not be receiving the benefits they are promised, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></strong>

The St. Louis-based Ascension Health, the country&apos;s largest nonprofit hospital system, is currently in talks to acquire an unnamed insurance company that operates in 18 states. These historical adversaries are now getting cozy to better design incentives for higher-quality care and cut costs, putting competitors at a disadvantage or driving them out.

A joint provider-insurer may also be better able to adapt to - and make more money from - new Medicare payment models in the Affordable Care Act.

But with less competition, an organization would be in a good position to raise premiums, which is why health economists and antitrust regulators are watching these market dynamics with a concerned eye.

A study published in the journal Health Services Research last year found that insurance plans offered by hospitals not only charge higher premiums, but show no increase in quality due to these premiums. No evidence was found to associate integration with more generous health plan benefits. Read the full details here:

<strong><a title="When Hospital Systems Buy Health Insurers" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/upshot/when-hospital-systems-buy-health-insurers.html?ref=health" target="_blank">When Hospital Systems Buy Health Insurers</a></strong>

A new trend is developing that bears closer watch: hospital systems buying the very health insurance carriers who provide payment to them for patient care. Is this smart business or consolidation of two areas that may result in worse care and less coverage for patients? Only time and close inspection will help answer that.

<strong>Following allegations about treatment delays and falsified records at Veterans Affairs health centers nationwide, more veterans will now be allowed to obtain health care at private hospitals and clinics, according to <em>NBC News.&#xA0;</em></strong>

The Obama administration issued this directive after both parties pressed for policy change in order to improve the treatment of veterans.

There are currently 26 VA facilities under investigation, including the Phoenix VA hospital, where a former clinic director says as many as 40 veterans may have died while awaiting treatment.

Last year, the VA spent about $4.8 billion on medical care at non-VA hospitals and clinics, about 10 percent of health care costs for the Veterans Health Administration, the agency&apos;s health care arm. Read the full details here:

The &#x201C;VA Scandal&#x201D; is news because national media has finally picked up on it. However, many in the medical malpractice industry have seen the poor care, malpractice and abuses of the veterans the VA services for many years. In addition to malpractice, the government further harms their veterans by capping the amount of damages veterans can receive in a valid claim for medical malpractice. Tort reform hurts everyone, even those who served and fought for the U.S.

A new lawsuit brought against five pharmaceutical companies alleges that deceptive marketing campaigns enacted by these drug companies are to blame for the current epidemic of prescription painkiller abuse, according to <em>Businessweek</em>.

Two counties in California are suing the drug companies for turning drugs that were once narrowly prescribed for short-term acute pain into commonplace remedies for conditions such as arthritis and back pain, downplaying the risk of addiction. The defendants include comapnies that have made billions selling widely used painkillers such as OxyContin, Percocet, and Actiq.

According to the Centers for Disease Contol, deaths involving prescription painkillers have more than tripled in the first decade of the 21st century.

Attorneys for Orange County and Santa Clara County say the drugmakers violated state laws against both false advertising and unfair competition. The suit says that these companies co-opted doctors and patient advocacy groups to overstate the benefits of pain pills while soft-pedaling the risks of additiction.

The lawsuit is an aggressive strike at the drugmakers that is &quot;reminiscent of the legal attack against the tobacco industry,&quot; according to the&#xA0;<em>Los Angeles Times</em>. Read the full details here:

The overuse and overprescription of painkillers is a significant problem in the U.S. While many blame those who seek the drugs and the physicians who overwrite prescriptions, a new focus is on the manufacturers of these drugs and their role as well.

<strong>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned consumers to beware of dietary supplements that falsely claim to prevent or cure concussions or other traumatic brain injuries, according to a recent <em>CBS News </em>article.</strong>

Supplements with labels that make these claims are not backed up by scientific evidence, according to the FDA, who has taken action in the past to crack down on companies touting&#xA0;medical benefits that have not been proven.

The risk for head trauma from contact sports, such as football and wrestling, has provided another marketing opportunity for companies to make false claims that certain dietary supplements can help cure or prevent these types of injuries.

&quot;I think the bigger problem here is that we don&apos;t want people to have the impression that there&apos;s a pill they can take that substitutes [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][for] being careful,&quot; said Dr. Michael Lipton of the Montefiore Medical Center in New York.

With the steady rise of both surgical errors and prescription drug addictions nationwide, more and more patients are seeking non-mainstream medical options for health problems such as chronic low back pain, according to <em>The Courier-Journal</em>.

The National center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine suggests many options to treat low back pain, the most popular of which include acupuncture, massage, yoga and spinal manipulation.

People who suffer from chronic low back pain sometimes look beyond mainstream medicine because even &quot;very invasive surgeries do not necessarily confer a cure for this,&quot; and narcotics can lead to devastating problems, such as addition, according to Dr. Deborah Ballard of KentuckyOne Health.

&quot;When people rely on things like drugs, surgery and injections, once that&apos;s over, what do you do? You have to go home and live your life every day,&quot; said Ballard. &quot;So if you can learn how to incorporate things in your daily life that help you deal with pain, then you can live a lot better life with less suffering.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong>A lot of questions remain after the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States was mistakenly sent home from the hospital with the diagnosis of a &quot;low-grade fever from a viral infection,&quot; according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.</em></strong>

Nurses and doctors at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas failed to act on the information that the patient, Thomas E. Duncan, had arrived from Liberia, allowing him to put others at risk of contracting Ebola upon his release.

The hospital has retracted previous statements that a flaw in its electronic health records system was to blame for the decision to send Duncan home the first time he visited its emergency room on Sept. 25. The hospital had said previously that the patient&apos;s condition during his first visit did not warrant admission and that he was not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola.

<strong>As you are driving down the highway, those commercial trucks weighing 25 to 50 times the size of your vehicle may be driven by operators who spent only 10 hours in a classroom and none on the road before receiving their license, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

Despite being ordered twice by Congress to come up with training requirements for commercial truck drivers, the Transportation Department has yet to do so. This has caused a group of safety advocates and the Teamsters union to sue the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in federal court, saying the agency has dragged its feet on the long-overdue rules for over 20 years.

While overall automobile fatalities in the United States have decreased in recent years, deaths and injuries involving large trucks have been rising for a total of 4,000 deaths and 70,000 injuries in 2012. An additional 200,000 accidents with large trucks caused damage but no injuries, according to Transportation Department data.

Meanwhile, the drivers of these 60-80 ton vehicles spend barely more than a day in the classroom for training after they complete the relatively simple process of getting a commercial driver&apos;s license.

&quot;They pass a written test, drive a truck around the parking lot for 10 minutes to get their C.D.L. and they&apos;re basically able to go out,&quot; said Henry Jasny, general counsel at Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. &quot;That&apos;s just not acceptable.&quot;

<strong>The Supreme Court is set to argue next month the privacy of jury deliberations and how to address dishonesty during jury selection, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.&#xA0;</em></strong>

Supreme Court precedents and a rule of evidence currently set strict limits on inquiries into what jurors said or did during deliberations, even where irresponsible or improper behavior affect verdicts.

&quot;A barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct&quot; would undermine candid discussions during deliberations, wrote Justice Sandra Day O&apos;Connor on the subject. It would make it harder for jurors to take unpopular positions and could subject former jurors to harassment. It could also undermine the finality of verdicts, allowing challenges for months or years afterward.

But the question remains, if a juror lied during jury selection, is it still attacking &quot;the validity of a verdict&quot; by insisting on the constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury? For instance, prospective jurors almost never admit to racial prejudice, but it has been known to infect deliberations. Read the full details here:

<strong>The rare and usually mild enterovirus D68 has been recently sending kids in several Midwest cities to the hospital, worrying parents and doctors alike.</strong>

Here are some things you should know about the virus, according to <em>NBC News</em>:
<ol>
    <li><b>How dangerous is this virus? </b>It does not seem to be causing an epidemic (at least not yet), but it is serious enough to worry the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most kids infected will likely have mild cold-like symptoms and will get better on their own.</li>
    <li><strong>Where did it come from? </strong>It&apos;s not a new virus, but it does rarely circulate and make kids sick. Adults are usually immune.</li>
    <li><strong>How can I prevent it? </strong>Your best defense is to wash your hands. The virus spreads when kids touch an infected surface and then touch their mouths, noses or eyes. Wiping tables and desks with a disinfectant wipe also reduces infection risks.</li>
    <li><strong>What&apos;s the best treatment? </strong>Antibiotics are useless against the virus, and there is no vaccine. The best course is rest, fluids, and perhaps ibuprofen or acetaminophen to ease the fever and achiness.</li>
    <li><strong>How can we prevent its spread? </strong>Do not send your child to school or daycare if he or she is sick. Children with fevers or respiratory symptoms not caused by asthma should be kept home.</li>

<strong>After many years of denial, the National Football League has finally recognized that rate of severe brain damage in its players that is much higher than the general population, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.</em></strong>

The NFL has stated in federal court documents that it expects nearly a third of retired players to develop long-term cognitive problems and that the conditions are likely to emerge at &quot;notably younger ages&quot; than in the general population.

Scientists have said for years that playing football increases the risk of developing neurological conditions like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease that can be identified only in an autopsy.

&quot;This statement clears up all the confusion and doubt manufactured over the years questioning the link between brain trauma and long-term neurological impairment,&quot; said Chris Nowinski, executive director of the Sports Legacy Institute. &quot;We have come a long way since the days of outright denial. The number of former players predicted to develop dementia is staggering, and that total does not even include former players who develop mood and behavior disorders and die prior to developing the cognitive symptoms associated with C.T.E.&quot; Read the full story here:

<strong>Long-term use of several common anti-anxiety and insomnia drugs may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer&apos;s disease later in life by as much as 51 percent, according to a recent <em>CBS News </em>article.&#xA0;</strong>

A recent study found that people who took benzodiazepines - which includes Valium, Ativan, Xanax and Klonopin - for more than three months have a higher risk for dementia. The study also indicated that long-acting or extended release forms of the drugs were associated with higher risk for Alzheimer&apos;s than shorter acting forms of the same medication.

The drugs are frequently prescribed because anxiety is a common problem among aging people. Anxiety disorders impact approximately 3 to 14 percent of older adults each year, according to the National Institutes of Health.

&quot;Older adults have increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines and slower metabolism of long-acting agents,&quot; write the authors of the American Geriatrics Society in a 2012 report. &quot;In general, all benzodiazepines increase risk of cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle accidents in older adults.&quot;

An estimated 36 million people worldwide currently suffer from dementia, and rates of Alzheimer&apos;s disease continue to grow as the population ages. Read the full details here:

<strong>A common mindset within the medical community is that American patients are not very skilled consumers of health care and assume high prices mean high quality, but a recent study proves that may not be true.&#xA0;</strong>

Tests like MRIs show some of the widest price variation in American medicine, often varying by a factor of 10 even within the same city.

WellPoint insurance members who scheduled an appointment for an elective MRI were given a list of other scanners in their area that could do the test at a lower price. The alternative providers were vetted for quality, and patients were asked if they wanted help rescheduling the test somewhere that delivered &quot;better value.&quot;

Fifteen percent of patients agreed to change their test to a less costly center, according to the study published in the journal Health Affairs.

The program resulted in a $220 cost reduction per test over the course of two years, reducing the price variation between hospital and nonhospital facilities by 30 percent in areas where it was implemented, according to the study.

The exercise in price transparency forced hospitals in areas with the program to lower their prices because &quot;they were beginning to lose patient referrals.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>The Medicare &quot;five-star&quot; rating of nearly 3,000 nursing homes across the country may be misleading to the true state of the facilities due to incomplete information, according to <em>The New York Times.</em></strong>

The issue is that Medicare bases their ratings largely on self-reported data by the nursing homes that the government does not, in turn, verify.

Only one of the three criteria used to determine the star ratings - the results of annual health inspections - relies on assessments from independent reviewers. The other measures - staff levels and quality statistics - are reported by the nursing homes and accepted by Medicare, with little exceptions, at face value.

The Medicare ratings, which have become the gold standard across the industry, do not take into account sets of potentially negative information, including fines and other enforcement actions by state, rather than federal, authorities, as well as complaints filed by consumers with state agencies. Read the full details here:

<strong>Crandall &amp; Pera Law Attorney Marc Pera recently won a significant victory for his client, Victoria Stamper and her husband Steve, in a medical malpractice case against Michael Draznik, M.D.</strong>

Dr. Draznik performed two surgeries on Victoria to remove her uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. A portion of her fallopian tube was inadvertently left in during the second surgery, causing abdominal and pelvic pain.

On July 8, 2011, Dr. Draznik performed a laparotomy (open abdominal surgery) on Victoria to remove the tubal remnant and scar tissue. Following this surgery, Victoria had a fever, fast heart rate, high white blood cell count, and other symptoms consistent with a bowel perforation.

By the time the perforation was diagnosed after a four day delay, Victoria was septic and had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xA0;(ARDS) and permanent lung damage.

After a two week trial and three days of deliberations, a Hamilton County jury found in favor of the Stampers and awarded them $1.2 million, including $425,000 for Steve Stamper&apos;s loss of consortium.

<strong>Even as the world&apos;s most technologically advanced country, the United States is ranked 34th among developed countries when it comes to the rate of infant mortality, according to a recent article in <em>The Columbus Dispatch.</em></strong>

Ohio, meanwhile, is currently ranked 43rd in the nation for the same statistic.

A strong link between infant mortality rates and socioeconomic factors such as poverty, poor education and racial disparities may be to blame for these unacceptable figures. Research strongly suggests that adverse economic or social experiences early in childhood can harm health and well-being many decades later.

In terms of infant-mortality rates, the best health care in the world cannot overcome the cumulative effect of poverty, the strain of racial disparity and inadequate education on mothers, families and their fragile infants.

To further improve infant-mortality rates in the United States, a woman&apos;s health must be addressed long before pregnancy, according to Dr. John Barnard, president of the Research Institute at Nationwide Children&apos;s Hospital. Read the full details here:

Bon-Ing Care and Rehabilitation of Gahanna was found to have violations that posed &quot;immediate jeopardy&quot; and &quot;real and present danger&quot; to residents during four complaint investigations and one biannual inspection by state health officials from March 14 through August 11.

Inspectors found that the nursing home failed to adopt interventions that would prevent additional problems from occurring, and it didn&apos;t have enough workers to handle problems when they arose, according to state inspection reports.

This is the third Central Ohio nursing home with serious trouble in the past year. Carlton Manor in Washington Court House closed in February after a series of failed inspections, and Autumn Health Care in Zanesville was shut down after authorities installed surveillance cameras in patients&apos; rooms following complaints about mistreatment.

&quot;Good nursing homes can have problems,&quot; said Beverly Laubert, the state&apos;s long-term-care ombudsman, &quot;but the difference is they analyze what&apos;s gone wrong, find out why it has happened and put measures in to prevent further issues.&quot; Read the full story here:

<strong>Two strategies proven to be effective in preventing premature infant deaths are largely underused globally, contributing to the deaths of nearly 1 million children each year, according to a recent study published in <em>The Lancet</em>.</strong>

Injections of coricosteroids help fetal lungs to mature before delivery, reducing respiratory distress, mortality and infections in the 48 hours after birth. Drugs to delay labor give these injections more time to take effect and allow for necessary transfer to a more intensive health care setting.

But only 18 percent of women in spontaneous premature labor receive both these treatments, according to data from 359 facilities in 29 countries. More concerning is that 42 percent of women studied received neither treatment and more than a third of women in premature labor received ineffective treatments like bed rest.

<strong>As the rate of painkiller abuse continues to steadily rise nationwide, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has placed stricter controls on prescription drugs containing hydrocodone.</strong>

Drugs such as Vicodin, Lortab and their generic equivalents will now be in the same regulatory class as painkillers such as Oxycontin, Percocet and codeine. Patients will only have access to a three-month supply of the drug and will have to see a doctor to receive any refills.

Some 22 million Americans have misused prescription&#xA0;painkillers of some kind since 2002, according to a report released by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Prescription painkillers now rank only behind marijuana as a drug of abuse in the U.S.

<strong>Picking a nursing home for a loved one should not be trial and error, especially with nearly half of these facilities&apos; residents suffering from dementia, according to a recent article in<em>&#xA0;The New York Times.</em></strong>

The decision to place a loved one in a nursing home is often a difficult but necessary one as falls, fires, poisonings, self-injuries and physical aggression often become ever-present dangers. And it is not always easy to find a place that offers the services and environment&#xA0;that the patient needs.

Joanna R. Leefer, the author of &quot;Almost Like Home,&quot; a guide to choosing a nursing home, lists six crucial questions to ask when assessing a nursing home for someone with dementia.
<ol>
    <li>Is the dementia unit large enough so that the resident will not feel confined?</li>
    <li>Does it offer activities appropriate for the person&apos;s intellectual abilities?</li>
    <li>Does it have a positive environment - colorful, but not overly stimulating or confusing?</li>
    <li>Are music and singing included in the activities?</li>
    <li>Is the staff trained to handle patients with dementia and Alzheimer&apos;s? How does the staff deal with patients who act out?</li>
    <li>Are residents in the dementia wing kept clean and well dressed, and treated with the same respect as those in other parts of the facility?</li>
</ol>
Experts say that continued family support and involvement are critical to assuring good patient care. Plan to spend several hours with the patient on the day of admission, when anger, hurt and acting out are likely. Visit often on different days and times, and get to know the staff.

<strong>The federal government&apos;s new tobacco regulations could be vulnerable to legal challenges from the tobacco industry due to an included &quot;happiness quotient,&quot; according to a recent article in<em>&#xA0;The New York Times.</em></strong>

The cost-benefit calculation of the new regulations assume that the benefits from reducing smoking - fewer early deaths and diseases of the lungs and heart - have to be discounted by 70 percent to offset the loss in pleasure that smokers suffer when they give up their habit.

Experts say that calculation wipes out most of the economic benefits from the regulations and the power of the Food and Drug Administration.

&quot;This threatens the F.D.A.&apos;s ability to take strong actions against tobacco,&quot; said Frank J. Chaloupka, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. &quot;If they can&apos;t demonstrate that there is a significant economic benefit to doing it, then it makes their job much harder.&quot;

A group of prominent economists believes the happiness quotient is way too high and should be changed before the regulations take effect. Read the full details here:

<strong>Parents may be making frequent dosing errors with their children&apos;s prescriptions and over the counter medications when estimating the amounts, according to a recent study.&#xA0;</strong>

More than 40 percent of the parents interviewed for the study did not measure the medication correctly; one out of six of those parents used spoons out of their kitchen drawer.

A study in pediatric emergency medicine done a few years ago found the highest rate of dosing errors happened when in the middle of the night, when the fewest number of patients were there, which could also be a common time for mistakes when it comes to parents.

Some doctors believe prescribing medications in milliliters rather than teaspoons forces caregivers to be more precise. Manufacturers are also doing their part in bundling droppers into infant products, but since many of the medications are bought off the shelf, it really comes down to parents being willing to put away the spoon.

&quot;There&apos;s a disturbing thing with drugs like Tylenol, acetaminophen,&quot; said Dr. Michael Rieder, chair of the drug therapy committee for the Canadian Pediatric Society. &quot;There&apos;s a couple disturbing papers which suggested that a relatively small overdose, over a period of several days can result in liver damage....So under those circumstances, there&apos;s a certain number of children that get toxicity from small but sustained doses.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>Doubts remain about whether the benefit of prostate cancer screening&#xA0;is large enough to offset the harms caused by unnecessary biopsies and treatments that can render men incontinent and impotent, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.</em></strong>

A recent study published in The Lancet found that routine screening would lower the lifetime cancer risk of the average middle-age man by about 2.4 percent. For every 27 cancers detected by PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screening, only one man&apos;s life would be saved.

The PSA test puts men on a path of repeated biopsies and testing, and for some, treatment of a cancer that would have never caused a problem if left alone. Cancer experts now say the focus should be on screening men at high risk and working to identify non-aggressive cancers so men will not be unnecessarily treated for the disease.

In 2011, United States Preventive Services Task Force concluded that healthy men should not be screened for prostate cancer, a finding that drastically changed the standard of care for men who had grown accustomed to annual screenings.

&quot;This overdiagnosis is unacceptable because it also leads to treatment,&quot; said Dr. Fritz H. Schroder, the study&apos;s lead author. &quot;That&apos;s why there is consensus worldwide, with very few exceptions, that the time has not come to recommend population-based screening.&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong><a title="Prostate Cancer Screening Still Not Recommended for All" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/prostate-cancer-screening-still-not-recommended-for-all/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Prostate Cancer Screening Still Not Recommended for All</a></strong>

PSA testing has been recommended for the early detection of prostate cancer. However, new studies question the amount of benefit.

<strong>A recent study published in the&#xA0;<em>New England Journal of Medicine </em>concluded there is another gene that can greatly raise the risk for breast cancer.&#xA0;</strong>

The PALB2 gene is probably the most dangerous in terms of breast cancer after the BRCA genes, according to the study&apos;s authors, with mutations in the gene making breast cancer up to nine times more likely to develop.

The PALB2 gene works with BRCA2 as a tumor suppressor, so when it is mutated, cancer can flourish.

The faulty gene seems to give a woman a 14 percent chance of breast cancer by age 50 and 35 percent by age 70, with an even greater risk if she has two or more close relatives with the disease. Men with a faulty PALB2 gene also have a risk for breast cancer that is eight times greater than men in the general population. Read the full details here:

<strong>Medical records are raising new questions about the treatment the only person to die from Ebola in the United States received when he first sought care at a Dallas hospital, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.&#xA0;</em></strong>

When Thomas Duncan arrived at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 25, he had a 103 degree fever and severe pain. Even after learning that he had recently arrived from Africa, he was prescribed antibiotics and sent home. He returned to the emergency room three days later and died on Oct. 8.

The reported details about his condition contradict the hospital&apos;s previous description of Duncan&apos;s initial hospital visit. Hospital officials said he had a temperature of 100.1 degrees and that his symptoms &quot;were not severe at the time he first visited the hospital emergency department.&quot;

The hospital has made contradictory and inaccurate statements in the past two weeks, providing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the wrong dates and placing some of the blame of sending Duncan home on its electronic records system.

&quot;I&apos;m not a medical professional,&quot; said Duncan&apos;s brother, Wilfred Smallwood, &quot;but I thnk it&apos;s clear to the public that he went to the hospital the first time and was turned away and told, &apos;You&apos;re O.K.&apos; Who do you blame for it happening now? One hundred and three, they said go home. Now he&apos;s dead. Who do you blame for this?&quot; Read the full article here:

<strong><a title="Ebola Patient Sent Home Despite Fever, Records Show" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/us/thomas-duncan-had-a-fever-of-103-er-records-show.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Ebola Patient Sent Home Despite Fever, Records Show</a>&#xA0;</strong>

A great example of how care providers regularly defend themselves when&#xA0;they clearly committed malpractice. First, they misstated the clinical&#xA0;condition of the patient, then misstated the date they saw him. Then, they&#xA0;misstated the date he came back after their negligence and blamed&#xA0;their computer system for not giving the doctors the information. They now&#xA0;admit the doctors did get the information and state they&#xA0;are committed to good medicine.

Lawmakers, it is time to wake up and&#xA0;realize the only thing tort reform produces is really bad care layered by&#xA0;care providers lying about it after.

<strong>A major guardrail supplier has been found guilty of defrauding the federal government by selling systems that can malfunction during crashes and slice through cars, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times.</em></strong>

In 2005, Trinity Industries made changes to its rail head - the flat piece of steel at the front of the system - without telling the Federal Highway Administration, a change blamed in at least 14 other lawsuits for five deaths and more injuries.

The guardrail system works by collapsing when hit head-on, absorbing the impact of a vehicle and guiding the railing out of its path. The redesigned Trinity product can cause the system&apos;s rail head to jam instead of sliding along the rail, which can pierce an oncoming vehicle like a harpoon, endangering occupants.

The company sold the guardrails to state governments that, in turn, received federal reimbursement. While states are ultimately responsible for their highway equipment, the Federal Highway Administration plays a crucial role, providing guidance on which products are eligible for federal reimbursement dollars.

The changes were not disclosed by Trinity to the Federal Highway Administration for seven years, despite requirements that any such changes be reported immediately. A Texas jury awarded $175 million that will, under federal law, be tripled to $525 million. Read the full details here:

A defective guardrail has been sold for many years to various states.&#xA0;This guardrail does not operate to protect individuals who are in an&#xA0;accident; in fact, it often causes more harm by operating as a sword,&#xA0;cutting through the car and impaling occupants.

<strong>More than one in six U.S. hospitals currently have trouble stamping out infections that could become deadly, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis.&#xA0;</strong>

About one in every 25 hospitalized patients gets an infection nationwide, leading to 75,000 deaths each year - more deaths that from car crashes and gun shots combined.

In Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, a fifth of hospitals had worse than average ratings for at least one category of infection, according to the study.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports six categories of infections: those from flexible tubes inserted into veins to deliver medicines or nutrients; infections from catheters that drain bladders; those from antibiotic-resistant germs Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aeureus (MRSA); and two surgical site infections after hysterectomies and colon operations.

C. diff infections, which require hospitals to be careful in using the antibiotics necessary to combat the infections, were the most common problem at Cincinnati-area hospitals, including Jewish Hospital, Mercy Hospital Anderson, Mercy Hospital West and St. Elizabeth Hospital Fort Thomas.

Seven hospitals in the Cincinnati area have lower infection rates than expected nationally: Atrium Medical Center in Middletown, Bethesda North, Christ Hospital, Good Samaritan, Mercy Hospital Fairfield, St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Lakeside Park and the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.

<strong>What do you do when safety devices designed to protect you in your car end up becoming deadly?</strong>

This is exactly what happened to Florida woman Hien Tran, who died last month after a faulty airbag exploded during a car accident, sending shrapnel flying into her neck. Detectives searched for clues about the stab wounds in her neck until a letter from Honda arrived urging Ms. Tran to get the airbags in her Accord fixed, a week after she died from her injuries.

There have now been at least three deaths associated with the mushrooming recalls of vehicles containing defective airbags made by Takata, a Japanese auto supplier. More than 14 million vehicles from 11 automakers that contain the airbags have been recalled worldwide.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has urged the owners of more than five million vehicles to &quot;act immediately&quot; to get the airbags fixed. Honda said it did not have enough parts to fix the cars immediately, and Toyota said it would in some cases disable the airbags, leaving a note not to ride in the front passenger seat.

In the midst of a safety crisis, the auto industry has recalled more than 50 million vehicles in the United States this year alone, shattering the record of about 30 million in 2004. Airbags have been one of the biggest and longest-simmering problems.

Read the full story here:

<strong>Should a bar be held liable when&#xA0;overserving&#xA0;a patron turns to tragedy?</strong>

That&apos;s what Deborah Floyd of Cincinnati believes after her husband was struck on his bicycle and killed by a drunk driver coming from Ethel&apos;s Tavern in February.

<iframe id="sbg_video_frame" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.local12.com/template/flashplayers/jwplayer/dev/files/embed.html?video=2014/10/clips/OGVhNWQzNTY3NzIy&amp;cdn=wkrc&amp;adzone=http://cmpwlaw.web13.hubspot.com/4756/WKRC/Web/News/Top_Stories&amp;autoP=true&amp;poster=http://www.local12.com/news/features/top-stories/stories//images/OGVhNWQzNTY3NzIy_19530.jpg&amp;event=iframe player&amp;googleID=UA-37182509-1&amp;parent=http://www.local12.com" width="320" height="240" frameborder="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

The driver, Todd Shaw, drank six or seven beers at another bar that morning before going to Ethel&apos;s in the afternoon. There, he was served at least seven more drinks and then sold six cans of beer for the road by bartender Linda&#xA0;Coomer, one of which he opened before walking to his car.

&quot;We think it was a daily occurrence,&quot; said Crandall &amp; Pera Law&apos;s Marc&#xA0;Pera, Mrs. Floyd&apos;s lawyer. &quot;He started his days off at another bar and typically had the equivalent of six or seven drinks at that bar every day. And part of his routine, we believe, was to head from that bar to Ethel&apos;s. This is someone that was well-known to Ethel&apos;s - they routinely served him and, we believe,overserved&#xA0;him time and time again.&quot;

Shaw, who had previously been charged with seven DUI&apos;s, pleaded guilty to the fatal hit and run of Fred Carey.

&quot;People have asked me, &apos;What do you want? Do you want Ethel&apos;s shut down?&apos;&quot; said Mrs. Floyd in an interview with WKRC, Local 12. &quot;Well of course I do - but not because it&apos;s just Ethel&apos;s and the particular bar that&#xA0;overserved&#xA0;and resulted in the death of my husband. I want every bar to learn a lesson.&quot;

<strong>Four out of five heart attacks in men can be prevented with healthy lifestyle changes, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.&#xA0;</strong>

The study&apos;s researchers estimate that fewer than 2 percent of Americans follow lifestyles considered ideal for cardiovascular health. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and diet, adopting a regular exercise program, avoiding cigarettes, and keeping alcohol consumption to a minimum.

Approximately 720,000 Americans suffer heart attacks each year, most of which can be avoided by adopting these principles on a daily basis.

According to Dr. Sam Brar, a cardiologist at Kaiser Permanente, &quot;We know that in patients who have already developed blockages in the artery and have had to have open heart surgery of stenting procedures to fix those blockages, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can significantly increase their life expectancy.&quot; Read the full details here:

<strong>With increasing concern that doctors are too quick to recommend spinal surgery, exercise is being proven as a relief to not go under the knife in many cases, according to a recent article in <em>The Columbus Dispatch.&#xA0;</em></strong>

Although exercise can seem like the worst idea when it hurts to move, spinal surgeons are finding that stretching and strengthening the core and other muscles that support the spine are essential to avoiding an operation.

Surgery should be seen as the last route in most cases, according to Dr. Safdar N. Khan, an orthopedic spine surgeon with Ohio State University&apos;s Wexner Medical Center. In Khan&apos;s practice, surgery is only available when patients have had three to six months of unrelenting symptoms, followed by six to eight weeks of non-operative treatment.

&quot;As a spine surgeon myself, the last thing I would want is to go under the knife,&quot; said Khan, who advocates for low-impact exercise like water therapy.

Physical therapy and weight loss should be the first steps for most patients, as well as quitting smoking, stretching, improving posture and getting good support during sleep, massage, yoga and acupuncture. Nonsurgical interventions, including steroid shots and chiropractic care, can also help alleviate pain in many cases. Read the full details here:

<strong>Substantial changes are coming for the government&apos;s five-star rating program for nursing homes and its controversial criteria basis, according to a recent article in <em>The New York Times</em>.</strong>

By 2013, nearly half of all nursing home facilities nationwide received four- or five-star ratings by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.&#xA0;But the current rating system relies so heavily on unverified and incomplete information that even homes with a documented history of quality problems are earning top ratings.

Two of the major criteria used to rate the facilities - staffing levels and quality statistics - are reported by the nursing homes themselves and generally not audited by the federal government.

Beginning in January, nursing homes will have to report their staffing levels quarterly using an electronic system that can be verified with payroll data. And officials will initiate a nationwide auditing program aimed at checking whether the so-called quality measures rating - which is based on information collected about every patient - is accurate.

Nursing homes&apos; ratings will also now be based partly on the percentage of its residents being given antipsychotic drugs. Read the full details here:

<strong>One of the most frequently-prescribed class of antibiotics may cause debilitating side effects much worse than the issues they are used to cure, according to a recent article in <em>USA Today</em>.&#xA0;</strong>

A citizens petition is asking the Food and Drug Administration to alert physicians and consumers about the potentially dangerous consequences of fluoroquinolones. This includes the known side effect of peripheral neuropathy, also known as nervous-system damage.

Fluoroquinolones are intended for serious infections, including sepsis, blood infections, infections that are resistant to conventional drugs, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. But doctors now prescribe the medicine for everything from sinus congestion to urinary-tract infections, often inappropriately prescribed or overused.

&quot;They&apos;re so active, they&apos;re the drug of choice for illnesses when they shouldn&apos;t be,&quot; said Dr. Ray Woosley, founder and president of CredibleMeds. &quot;There is no question we need these drugs. But when you&apos;re giving it to somebody with sinusitis (or other non-bacterial infections)...we&apos;re going to lose them because of overuse.&quot; Read the full details here:

Ohio and Kentucky have a number of V.A. facilities, including hospitals and rehabilitation centers. In general, the V.A. has come under a lot of scrutiny in the last few years as more and more of our service men and women come home with the classic signs of PTSD. But not every veteran has mental health concerns to be addressed; in some cases, the problem is much easier to see.

Back in 2008, the staff at the V.A.&#x2019;s Alvin C. York Medical Center in Murfreesboro discovered blood in the tubing of water system used for irrigation during colonoscopies. An investigation by the hospital determined that a required valve was missing during procedures performed that day, and that the tubing had not been disinfected or discarded per the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.

Investigators later found that the original valve had been replaced by one supposed to be used during the cleaning process. The new valve was not the one-way design that prevented the backflow of bodily fluids into the tubing. A review was unable to determine when the switch occurred, and the V.A. was ordered to notify veterans who had undergone colonoscopies dating back to the installation of the equipment in 2003.

A larger investigation found that sixteen other V.A. facilities reported non-compliance with cleaning guidelines for colonoscopy machines, but determined that the risk of infection was minimal and did not send warning letters to veterans.

The Murfreesboro V.A., meanwhile, sent all 6,387 veterans letters informing them of the problem, and offered precautionary blood tests. It was later reported that 92 of the veterans tested positive for viral infections- 71 for hepatitis C, 13 for hepatitis B, and 8 for HIV.

The V.A. released a statement saying, &#x201C;It is unacceptable that Veterans were exposed to harm at some V.A. facilities. When this came to light in 2009, V.A. undertook a comprehensive program that included policy implementation of new policy, standard operating procedures and additional individual training to ensure that reusable medical equipment was reprocessed properly and issues like this never happen again.&#x201D;

<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/ronan-farrow-daily/veterans-exposed-viruses-claim-va-avoided-responsibility">NBC News obtained records</a> through the Freedom of Information Act showing that 76 veterans filed malpractice claims against the V.A. as a result of the problem, including 21 who eventually tested positive for infections. Others claimed psychological harm from the stress of knowing that they were at risk. Despite the admission of guilt, however, the V.A denied most claims. In fact, the V.A. paid only 453 malpractice claims nationwide out of 1,600 filed in 2013.

The veterans affected are understandably baffled. An attorney who represented 40 veterans who filed claims said, &#x201D;After sending a letter stating that they had done something wrong and... exposed them to contaminants, they send a letter out after receiving the claims that they did nothing wrong... That makes no sense.&#x201D;

All 40 claims were denied.

Medical malpractice and medical negligence cases are complicated and difficult cases to bring forward. Numerous laws already exist which shield and benefit the defendant physicians and hospitals to the detriment of injured patients. Various legal opinions make bringing forward a malpractice case very expensive and difficult to prove at trial.

Because of the complicated nature of medical malpractice and medical negligence claims, it is important that the laws surrounding these issues remain as clear and impartial as possible, and that procedure is rigorously followed. A proposed new Ohio bill would muddy these waters by allowing doctors who speak privately with patients or families after a mistake to acknowledge responsibility or even admit to an error without that conversation being used against them in court. The bill is an expansion of the current &#x201C;I&#x2019;m Sorry&#x201D; law, which already shields doctors&#x2019; apologies.

This legislation resembles an almost identical bill pending in Congress. Six states have similar laws in effect; the stated intention is to reduce unnecessary litigation by giving affected parties the answers they seek without having to go to court. However, there are concerns that the legislation is unethical and could even lead to perjury, as doctors who admitted mistakes in private conversations wouldn&#x2019;t have to confirm such conversations under oath. Every other profession is required to disclose admission of mistakes to a jury or court.

Support of the proposed bill is understandably controversial. While the high cost of malpractice insurance is allegedly a contributing factor to high doctors&#x2019; fees, it is regarded as a necessary evil. Medical malpractice and medical negligence can have devastating impacts, and a mistake can have repercussions that last for a lifetime. Legislation like this adds an unnecessary safe guard to the physicians and hospitals, in an area of law that is already complicated and tilted in their favor.
<h3>Let Crandall &amp; Pera Law help you with your medical malpractice claims</h3>
In Ohio, there is a relatively short statute of limitations for filing lawsuits for medical malpractice cases. The same is true of Kentucky. If you believe you have a case, it is imperative to seek expert counsel as soon as possible to best protect your rights.

In an emotionally charged situation, it can be difficult to objectively assess the condition of a loved one in the care of medical professionals. Melissa Jude found herself in this situation less than a year ago, when her mother, Maxine Jude, became a resident of Raleigh Center in Daniels, West Virginia.

Over a period of six months, from April 2014 to September 2014, Maxine Jude suffered from falls, pressure sores, pneumonia, a urinary tract infection, and weight loss, ultimately resulting in her death. In the months following her death, Maxine&#x2019;s daughter sought counsel and filed a complaint on October 7 in Kanawha Circuit Court against Genesis Healthcare, the owner of Raleigh Center.

On the same day, Sandra Loftis filed a lawsuit in Kanawha Circuit Court as a personal representative of her sister&#x2019;s (Wilma Mae Mobley&#x2019;s) estate. Wilma Mae Mobley was a resident of Oak Ridge Center in Charleston, WV for four days in October of 2012. During that time, the complaint alleges that she suffered a fall, a urinary tract infection, and aspiration pneumonia, and that these injuries contributed to her death. Oak Ridge Center is also owned and operated by Genesis Healthcare.
<h2>Big business</h2>
As of 2012, Genesis Healthcare is listed as a privately held company that operates more than 200 facilities throughout 13 eastern states and employs more than 50,000 people. Genesis also supplies rehabilitation therapy to more than 1,100 healthcare providers in 35 states and the District of Columbia. It is a big business.

Both complaints, filed on the same day by unrelated parties, allege that the defendants were aware of &#x201C;<a href="http://wvrecord.com/news/271077-woman-blames-nursing-home-for-relatives-death">systematic problems</a>&#x201D; with patient care due to budgetary restrictions that caused staffing issues. According to the Genesis Healthcare website, both Raleigh Center and Oak Ridge Center are open and accepting new patients and both listings imply a high standard of professional medical care.

Melissa Jude&#x2019;s complaint also accuses the defendants of corporate negligence, negligence, nursing home violations, medical malpractice, and fraud among other charges. Sandra Loftis&#x2019; complaint accuses the defendants of statutory violations in failing to provide sufficient staff, and thus adequate care to its residents, negligence, reckless misconduct and wrongful death.

It is unfortunate that large companies operate with an eye for the bottom line as opposed to the well-being of their clients, but cases like these make use of the justice system to bring negligent practices to light. <img class="alignright wp-image-1511 size-medium" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Nursing-Home-Standards-of-Care-300x210.jpg" alt="Nursing Home Standards of Care" width="300" height="210">It is important to be make informed decisions in difficult circumstances, and to know the signs and symptoms of nursing home abuse and neglect before they occur, including:

BODY:
Elected officials and media pundits love to argue about tort reform &#x2013; namely, that this country needs it in order to secure the livelihoods of competent doctors. One of the most common arguments is that the practice of &#x201C;defensive medicine&#x201D; &#x2013; where doctors order excessive tests to ensure they screen a patient for every possibility, no matter how remote &#x2013; is driving up the cost of medicine; the other main argument is that the litigious nature of Americans is forcing doctors to close their offices, because their medical malpractice insurance is too high.

There are numerous problems with both of these arguments. First, a &#x201C;tort&#x201D; &#x2013; a wrongful act against a person for which another person or entity may be held liable &#x2013; in and of itself implies that the doctor has committed an error. People who make mistakes should be held accountable for those actions. However, &#x201C;Tort&#x201D; Reform interferes with a person&#x2019;s right to hold accountable an individual or entity who has wronged him or her.

Second, the legal system already has in place many safeguards to protect against frivolous lawsuits. In order for a case to be brought, a medical malpractice attorney must have evidence of:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Duty</strong>, or what the accepted standard level of care is</li>
    <li><strong>Breach</strong>, that your doctor failed to provide that accepted level of care</li>
    <li><strong>Causation</strong>, that your injuries or illness were a result of a breach of duty</li>
    <li><strong>Damages</strong>, which are your medical bills, lost wages, and your pain and suffering, all of which were a result of your injuries</li>
</ul>
If these four areas cannot be proved, a lawyer cannot ethically bring a medical malpractice lawsuit in Kentucky or Ohio. Thus, lawsuits that are brought against a doctor or hospital must be based on evidence of wrongdoing by a doctor or hospital. If someone commits a wrongful act, it only makes sense that they should be held accountable for their actions.

Finally, there is no real proof that &#x201C;defensive medicine&#x201D; is cost-prohibitive to hospitals. A study in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> found that &#x201C;completely defensive hospital orders accounted for just 2.9 percent of the costs, mostly because of additional days of hospitalization,&#x201D; according to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/10/15/study-dont-expect-big-health-care-savings-from-medical-malpractice-reform/"><em>Washington Post</em></a>.

What &#x201C;tort reform&#x201D; really means to most legislators is placing a limit, regardless of the severity of the injury, on the amount of money a victim may obtain. Kentucky, to date, has protected victims&#x2019; rights to receive full compensation for their injuries, but Ohio, unfortunately, has not: the most a plaintiff can recover is $1 million, and that is only in cases of catastrophic injury. &#xA0;However, both Kentucky and Ohio allow for punitive damages, which are monetary &#x201C;punishments&#x201D; for people who have hurt someone else. In Ohio in the case of medical malpractice, a plaintiff may also be granted $300,000 in non-economic damages, but a jury may award the victim another $3 million in punitive damages. Because punitive damages are rarely awarded, lowering the available compensation to victims of medical malpractice only serves to protect negligent doctors without regard for the injuries caused by their malpractice.
<h3>Protecting victims is our top priority</h3>
Tort reform is not about reform: it is about protecting the rights of doctors and hospitals at the expense of the rights of victims. For more information about tort reform in Kentucky or Ohio, we invite you to contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law. We can help you understand the effects tort reform will actually have on victims.

People with diabetes or any glucose-related health condition must test their glucose levels each day. To do so they take a small sample of blood, usually from the finger. A new sensor developed by the University of California, San Diego may put an end to those blood samples once and for all.

The researchers have developed a <a href="http://www.medgadget.com/2015/01/printed-tattoo-glucose-sensor-takes-on-hated-pinpricks.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Medgadget+%28Medgadget%29">stick-on tattoo</a> that &#x201C;samples interstitial fluid within the skin that contains glucose&#x2026;.&#x201D; So far the senor has only been tested on seven volunteers, none of whom have diabetes &#x2013; but all seven were given an accurate glucose reading. It could be the first step towards the end of pinpricks forever.
<h2>Diagnosing diabetes</h2>
The American Diabetes Association advises people who are at risk of type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease by:
<ul>
    <li>Eating healthy and maintain a healthy body weight</li>
    <li>Quitting smoking</li>
    <li>Exercising more</li>
    <li>Lowering high blood pressure</li>
</ul>
If you are at risk, you should ask your doctor to test you for signs of the disease, or for pre-screening to see if you are at risk. You may require a second test to ensure that your glucose levels are the same, since various factors can change your levels. Your doctor may determine that you have developed an insulin resistance, which could lead to diabetes if left untreated.
<h2>Symptoms related to other conditions</h2>
Diabetes shares a number of symptoms with other health conditions. Some of these conditions can mimic the symptoms of diabetes, so a complete battery of tests is necessary to rule them out. These conditions include:
<ul>
    <li>Chronic pancreatitis</li>
    <li>Polycystic ovary syndrome</li>
    <li>Carcinoid syndrome</li>
    <li>Overactive pituitary or adrenal glands</li>
    <li>Metabolic syndrome</li>
</ul>
Each of these diseases and conditions can be life-threatening if left undiagnosed and untreated, just as diabetes would be.

This is why the new sensor is so exciting. Not only will it making testing glucose levels easier and less painful for people with diabetes, but it could help doctors monitor patients who may be at risk of developing the disease. This could help patients get the help they need more quickly in the future.

BODY:
When Calven Goza&#x2019;s 2012 car crash left him unable to move anything below the chest, he expected that he would never walk again. That did not stop him from hoping he might do so again one day &#x2013; and thanks to a revolutionary program out of the University of Louisville, it looks like Mr. Goza&#x2019;s hopes were well-founded. This past December, he was able to move his leg for the first time since his accident.

So far, a total of five men &#x2013; Goza included &#x2013; have undergone the surgical treatment developed by the University. <a href="http://mtstandard.com/news/local/tech-student-paralyzed-by-wreck-can-move-legs-again-thanks/article_2ec0adb1-57e8-55cb-b1df-8e6a5a12220b.html">All five men have</a> &#x201C;regained movement in their legs, and can use them to help support them while standing. They&#x2019;ve also seen improvements in blood pressure regulation, bladder function, and sexual function.&#x201D;

Surgeons implanted electrodes near the vertebrae in the spine; in Mr. Goza&#x2019;s case, the T12 and L1 vertebrae. After recuperating from the surgery, the doctors began sending electrical pulses to the electrodes to &#x201C;map&#x201D; the spine, to see what combination of electrodes was having what effect. Because the study is ongoing, the researchers have not released all of the details about why the process works, or how they can map the spine. But Mr. Goza is living proof that whatever the University of Louisville is doing, it is definitely on the right path.
<h2>Paralysis by the numbers</h2>
Mr. Goza and the four other men in the study are lucky to have been chosen; more than 1,000 people were on the University&#x2019;s list, and nearly <a href="http://www.christopherreeve.org/site/c.mtKZKgMWKwG/b.5184189/k.5587/Paralysis_Facts__Figures.htm">6 million people</a> in the U.S. suffer with some form of paralysis. Of those 6 million, about 1.275 million are paralyzed as the result of a spinal cord injury. Like Mr. Goza, <a href="http://www.christopherreeve.org/site/c.mtKZKgMWKwG/b.5184255/k.6D74/Prevalence_of_Paralysis.htm">24% of those victims</a> were paralyzed in an auto accident &#x2013;&#xAD; the second most common cause of spinal cord injury-related paralysis in the country. Paralysis can happen if you are in an accident where:
<ul>
    <li>You collide with another vehicle or a stationary object</li>
    <li>You are not wearing your seat belt</li>
    <li>Your airbags fail to deploy, or your seat belt fails to keep you in the car</li>
    <li>You are hit by a drunk driver</li>
    <li>You suffer a traumatic brain injury</li>
    <li>You are riding a motorcycle without a helmet</li>
</ul>
We are very happy for Mr. Goza, and we hope that the University of Louisville continues to see such positive results from its new program. We also hope that one day its procedures will be available to everyone who can benefit from them.

<div class="layer text">

Sleep deprivation is a serious problem; it affects not only our overall health, but our ability to make decisions. When a healthcare provider is overly fatigued it can lead to catastrophic results. That is why the <a href="http://www.nursingworld.org/">American Nurses Association</a> is seeking to create policies to help keep nurses from working long shifts and mandatory overtime, hoping that fewer mistakes will be made if the nurses on duty are more awake and alert.

According to <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2015/01/30/nurse-fatigue/22618173/">Cincinnati.com,</a> the ANA wants employers such as hospitals to:
<ul>
    <li>Limit shifts to 12 hours or fewer and workweeks to 40 hours or fewer.</li>
    <li>Eliminate mandatory overtime.</li>
    <li>Keep consecutive night shifts to a minimum for nurses working both days and nights.</li>
    <li>Promote frequent rest breaks and provide sleep rooms or transportation when nurses are too tired to drive.</li>
    <li>Give nurses the right to reject work assignments to prevent fatigue.</li>
</ul>
Other states have already started addressing the problem of fatigued nursing staff. <a href="http://www.kentuckyonehealth.org/">KentuckyOne Health</a>, which bills itself as &#x201C;the largest and most comprehensive health system in the Commonwealth,&#x201D; employs &#x201C;flex nurses.&#x201D; These nurses work flexible hours and schedules so that no one works too long or while fatigued.
<h2>The dangers of fatigue</h2>
The article references a &#x201C;groundbreaking study in the journal Health Affairs in 2004 looked at 393 nurses over more than 5,300 shifts and found that those who worked shifts 12 1/2 hours or longer were <strong>three times more likely </strong>than others to make an error in patient care&#x201D; (<strong>emphasis ours</strong>). This is not surprising, as <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body">sleep deprivation</a> has been linked to impaired brain activity, memory problems, cognitive dysfunction and changes in mood. People who are chronically fatigued may not even have the physical energy to perform their jobs correctly. Cincinnati.com points to a study by the <a href="http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/23/1/13"><em>American Journal of Critical Care</em></a> which claims that &#x201C;fatigued nurses are more likely than well-rested nurses to make <strong>faulty decisions that lead to decision regret</strong>, a negative cognitive emotion that occurs when the actual outcome differs from the desired or expected outcome&#x201D; when it comes to helping victims in critical care situations (<strong>emphasis ours</strong>).
<h3><strong>Learn more about the dangerous effects of fatigue</strong></h3>
At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we applaud the ANA for taking steps to reduce fatigue; it will make both nurses and their patients safer.

BODY:
A traumatic brain injury, or TBI, may be life-altering. The actual injury to the brain can take many forms, and the effects can be present immediately or take weeks to manifest. No two brain injuries are alike, and the results can be range from mild to severe. Regardless of the classification of the injury, the effects can be devastating to victims and their families.

Therapy following a traumatic brain injury can be time-consuming and cost prohibitive. Long term treatments can include a mix of physical and occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, counseling, support groups, and medication. Because of the unique nature of every brain injury, there is no guaranteed path to recovery. Instead, a trial and error approach is used to determine the right mix of therapies for the victim.

An alternative therapy out of the Centre for Neuro Skills in Bakersfield, California, has so far yielded positive results. The Centre has been hosting drum circles every Tuesday and Thursday night for the last year and a half. Betty Mendez facilitates the circles, and says that every member participating in the therapy has shown signs of improvement since they started.
<h2>Why the therapy might be working</h2>
The theory is that &#x201C;any activity that crosses the midline of the body, like the act of drumming, helps the two hemispheres in the brain to start communicating again.

Richard Andretti, a client who was injured on a job site, says he looks forward to therapy as a respite from his week. He said, &#x201C;The thing about the drumming that helps me is that it takes it all away when I&#x2019;m banging the drum.&#x201D;

Mendez sometimes leads the group with a certain beat and sometimes allows someone else in the group to lead. The drum therapy is combined Reiki meditation, which Sarah Hartford, the activities director, says is an important part of the therapy. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re able to come and refocus their day after having kind of a crazy day with all the things they&#x2019;re doing in therapies and just kind of get back to their center,&#x201D; she said.

The value of some alternative medicines is highly questionable. However, the <a href="http://www.neuroskills.com/about-us/licenses-and-accreditations.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Neuro Skills</a> is accredited by CARF International (formerly the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) for its Brain Injury Specialty Programs. Until new research shines light into repairing traumatic brain injuries, it&#x2019;s important to know that there are alternative solutions.

BODY:
A state Senate committee approved legislation early this February that would create an autonomous panel to review potential lawsuits regarding medical malpractice. Senator Ralph Alvarado (R-Winchester) sponsored <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/record/15rs/SB6.htm">Senate Bill 6</a> with the intention of reducing the number of frivolous medical malpractice suits and the associated cost to medical providers.

However, opponents of the legislation believe that the addition of a medical review panel would hinder justice by adding a complex maze of hurdles for plaintiffs to navigate before they gain access to the most fundamental right that this country offers; the right to a jury by one&#x2019;s peers. The civil justice system already is painfully slow and arduous. These proposed review panels will likely add many months, if not years, to the process of having a medical malpractice case heard by a jury. The process typically takes several years before an injured victim sees a courtroom now.&#xA0;&#xA0; Unfortunately, catastrophically injured patients often die from their injuries, while waiting for their day in court, because they can&#x2019;t afford desperately needed treatment. The companies pushing this bill through the Kentucky legislature are well aware that the longer it takes a case to reach a jury always is to their benefit. The more hurdles, the less likely an injured patient lives to see their day in court. It is that simple.

Unfortunately, the proponents of this bill are misguided, misinformed or worse. For instance, Kentucky attorneys and their clients can be subject to a claim of malicious prosecution if they bring a frivolous lawsuit against a medical care provider. In Kentucky, doctors and hospitals have, on multiple occasions, successfully prosecuted attorneys and their clients for bringing frivolous lawsuits. This threat, which many states do not have, alone deters many an attorney from filing a questionable lawsuit. In addition, as Senator Reginald Thomas (D-Lexington) pointed out, judges are already able to sanction or impose civil damages on lawyers for bringing meritless suits.

Along the same lines, a Louisville lawyer testified against the bill, saying, &#x201C;A Harvard University study, not paid for by trial lawyers, published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>, concluded portraits of a malpractice system that is stricken with frivolous litigation are overblown. The data tells us that medical negligence lawsuits in this state comprise of less than one half of 1 percent of all civil cases. That&#x2019;s the data.&#x201D;

The approval of the committee is a small step toward approval of the legislation. The initiative will next go to the full Senate for consideration. Kentucky has a rich tradition of protecting the rights of the less fortunate. Make no mistake &#x2013; this bill is the product of billion dollar insurance companies, and their wealthy insureds, who want to increase their profits at the expense of citizens&#x2019; rights. Don&#x2019;t let them do it. Call your representative and let them know that you oppose any attempt to strip you of your right to a speedy trial. Let them know they should oppose Senate Bill 6.

Nursing homes across the country received lower scores from the government&#x2019;s five star rating system. A survey published in USA Today assessed <a href="http://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/story/news/local/2015/02/22/ohio-nursing-home-quality-scores-drop-new-federal-ratings/23836615/">more than 15,000 facilities</a> with information collected from over 1.5 million consumers. The slip isn&#x2019;t because of a decline in quality of care, however, but because of tougher standards implemented by the government.

Nursing home ratings involved three main categories; inspection, quality measure, and staffing rating. Inspection includes multiple years of survey data and complaints. Quality measure includes pain reports, and falls and use of restraints, while the staffing rating assesses the mix of nurses and aides as well as average time a patient has access to care professionals.

Researchers said that in addition to the categories above, the study includes a measure of the use of anti-psychotic drugs. The use of these drugs comes along with a high risk factor for the elderly, especially those with dementia. The new study also refined the way in which staffing is studied.

Not all nursing homes are happy with the changes, <a href="http://www.microcapobserver.com/new-report-one-third-of-the-nursing-homes-across-usa-are-receiving-lower-scores-on-governments-five-star-quality-scale/236387/">saying that</a> &#x201C;Federal ratings for nursing homes were inaccurate and artificially inflated, federal officials readjusted quality standards, which brought the ratings of nearly a third of the nation&#x2019;s nursing homes down...&#x201D; Operators are worried that the general public will misinterpret the new ratings as a decline in care quality instead of a change in the ranking system.

The people most affected by the change seem to be welcoming it. Robyn Grant is the Director of Public Policy and Advocacy at the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care. The group advocates for nursing home residents, and Director Grant released a statement saying, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been concerned for quite some time that the ratings have been over-inflated, particularly as they relate to quality and staffing. Rescaling the quality measures is going to result in more accurate reflections of quality care.&#x201D;

Choosing the right nursing home is difficult for any number of reasons, not least of which is the concern for an aging family member. We hope that these new standards provide a more accurate picture to prevent unnecessary suffering.

Heavy equipment was being used to separate the concrete deck on the Hopple Street overpass, a stretch of I-75 just north of downtown Cincinnati, when a late-night collapse left a construction worker dead and a big-rig driver injured. The span of bridge was being removed by Kokosing Construction as part of a three-year project to improve traffic flow and safety. At some point during the project, something went wrong, and the span fell.

Brandon William Carl, 35, of Augusta, Kentucky, was killed in the collapse, which brought hundreds of tons of concrete, metal and machinery on to the highway below. It took rescue workers <a href="http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/Deadly-bridge-collapse-shuts-down-I-75-in-Cincinnati-289105771.html">around four hours</a> to recover his body from the rubble using air bags and special equipment.

A tractor-trailer was passing under the bridge when rubble started to fall, causing driver Eric Meyers, 36, of Howell, Michigan to crash. Remarkably, Meyers wasn&#x2019;t seriously hurt. He was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center with minor injuries. Police Chief Jeff Blackwell <a href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2015/01/21/howell-man-injured-in-deadly-i-75-overpass-collapse-in-ohio/">said of the accident,</a> &#x201C;The big-rig driver is very lucky; in a matter of seconds his fate would have probably been different.&#x201D;

Police also said that the accident could have been much worse if the collapse had happened during a busy time on the interstate. Because the accident occurred around 10:30pm, instead of at rush hour, hundreds if not thousands of commuters&#x2019; lives were saved. Acting deputy director of the Ohio transportation department&#x2019;s southwest Ohio district, Gary Middleton, said the accident occurred during a &#x201C;routine operation&#x201D; and that Kokosing is a &#x201C;very safety-conscious&#x201D; contractor.

Kokosing could be fined for forcing lane closures and face disciplinary action by OSHA, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is investigating Carl&#x2019;s death. The company has had fewer than ten OSHA violations since 2003. Scott Allen, a spokesman for OSHA, said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a good track record for any company.&#x201D;

Though it could have been so much worse, this tragic accident left a young family fatherless and another man injured. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Brandon Carl, who left behind a fianc&#xE9;e and four children.

BODY:
In 2011, a jury in West Virginia awarded the family of a woman named Dorothy Douglas $91.5 million after Ms. Douglas died from neglect in a nursing home. It was a landmark case, and had that judgment been allowed to stand (it was reduced to $36.5 million later on) it might have sent a powerful message to facilities which prioritize profits over people. But instead of cheering for the justice system, the West Virginia legislature created Senate Bill 6 (SB6).

The bill expands the current definition of health care facilities to now include all operations of nursing homes. The bill gets rid of any distinction between ordinary negligence and medical negligence, which allows plaintiffs to sue for damages which are not part of the state&#x2019;s Medical Professional Liability Act.

In essence, the bill caps the amount of damages you can collect if a nursing home&#x2019;s gross negligence or abuse leads to the serious injury or wrongful death of your family member.
<h2>How the legislators are spinning the purpose of the bill</h2>
The legislature claims that large verdicts raise the costs of liability insurance, or that fear of a lawsuit will drive nursing home out of the state. They claim the bill makes sure that victims are compensated &#x201C;fairly.&#x201D;

<a href="http://wvmetronews.com/2015/02/24/lawmakers-fixing-nursing-home-loophole-in-medical-malpractice-law/">But here is the truth</a>: a person who is injured is only entitled to compensation amounts between $335,000 and $640,000 (depending on the circumstances) for an injury or a wrongful death, respectively. Now nursing homes which let their residents die, either from neglecting their needs or through abusive actions, are covered under these same caps.

While this bill makes its way into law, it&#x2019;s important to know the warning signs of nursing home abuse and neglect, especially since your options may be limited if your family member is hurt. If you have a loved one in a long-term care facility, be on the lookout for:
<ul>
    <li>Changes in behavior</li>
    <li>Physical or emotional withdrawal</li>
    <li>Unexplained injuries</li>
    <li>Bedsores</li>
    <li>Weight change or malnutrition</li>
    <li>Poor hygiene</li>
    <li>Unexplained hair loss or bleeding</li>
    <li>Missing items</li>
    <li>Unusual financial transactions</li>
    <li>Unexplained death</li>
</ul>
At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we are fighting every day for the victims of nursing home abuse and neglect. If you have a loved one in a nursing home in West Virginia, Ohio or Kentucky, it&#x2019;s important to have as much information about a facility and its caretakers as possible. If your loved one has been the victim or nursing home abuse or neglect, please contact us for a free consultation.

BODY:
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recently published a study that reports a substantial number of people have been infected by a potentially deadly bacteria who hadn&#x2019;t been in a hospital. Those infected had instead recently visited a doctor or dentist&#x2019;s office. The bacteria in question, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/pdfs/cdiff/Cdiff_tagged.pdf"><em>C. difficile</em></a>, is a type of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) that caused an estimated half a million infections and 29,000 deaths in 2011.

The bacteria cause inflammation of the colon called colitis. People who take antibiotics and get medical care are at risk. Once infected, <em>C. difficile</em> can cause deadly diarrhea. Researchers found the bacteria in six out of seven outpatient clinics in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/25/health/deadly-bacteria-doctors-offices/">2013 study</a> in Ohio. Dr. Cliff McDonald, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC, said, &#x201C;This is really an important issue. We need to understand better how people are getting C. diff.&#x201D;
<h2>Protecting yourself from C. diff</h2>
The CDC has compiled the following information about C. diff symptoms and prevention. First, the elderly and those with medical problems have the best chance of getting C. diff. The bacteria can live outside the body for a long time. An infection can spread from person-to-person on dirty equipment or on the hands of healthcare providers or visitors. Common symptoms include:
<ul>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Belly pain and tenderness</li>
    <li>Watery diarrhea</li>
    <li>Fever</li>
</ul>
If you have any of the symptoms listed above, please seek professional medical attention. An infection is usually easy to treat with antibiotics, but, if left untreated, can require surgery to remove infected parts of the intestines. Infection is also more likely when taking a broad-spectrum antibiotic. These powerful drugs eliminate good gut bacteria, leaving prime conditions for C. diff. The bacteria isn&#x2019;t vulnerable to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, so it&#x2019;s best to wash your hands after a visit to the doctor&#x2019;s office.

When seeking medical care, make sure that any healthcare professional you come in to contact with has cleaned their hands. It&#x2019;s ok to ask your doctor to wash his hands before touching you. Also, be sure to wash your own hands after a visit to any office or hospital.

If you or someone you know has contracted <em>C. difficile</em>, or has suffered any medical condition as a result of a doctor or hospital visit, please contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law for a free consultation.

A <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/herbal-supplements-targeted-by-new-york-attorney-general/">recent investigation</a> by the New York Attorney General discovered that herbal supplements being sold by Target, GNC, Walmart and Walgreens were contaminated with substances not listed on their labels, and that some brands did not contain any of the product listed on the label. The findings have led to a series of class action lawsuits against the companies seeking compensation for damages and purchase refunds.

<img class="alignright wp-image-1990 size-medium" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Herbal-Supplements-Dangerous-300x286.jpg" alt="dangerous supplements" width="300" height="286">On the face of it, herbal supplements seem at best to be harmless additions to your everyday diet. However, the findings presented by the New York Attorney General found that common herbal supplements contained contaminants that included common allergens. These undisclosed ingredients could cause allergic reactions, ranging from mild symptoms like itching or hives to major symptoms like anaphylactic shock resulting in death.

The Attorney General&#x2019;s office looked into top-selling store brands of Echinacea, Garlic, Ginkgo Biloba, Saw Palmetto, St. John&#x2019;s Wort, and Valerian Root. The supplements were DNA tested, and few were found to contain any plant DNA at all. Cease and desist letters were sent to the retailers demanding that the products be pulled from the shelves.

Among Walmart&#x2019;s store brand supplements, <a href="http://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/49382-herbal-supplement-scam-alleged-gnc-target-walgreens-wal-mart/">just 4%</a> were found to contain DNA from the plants listed on their respective labels. Walgreens faired slightly better, with 18%. Of the GNC supplements tested, 22% were found to have appropriate plant DNA, while Target scored best with 41%. Among the contaminants found were:
<ul>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Beans</li>
    <li>Pine</li>
    <li>Citrus</li>
    <li>Asparagus</li>
    <li>Primrose</li>
    <li>Wheat</li>
    <li>Houseplant</li>
    <li>Wild carrot</li>
</ul>
The Food and Drug Administration requires that food manufacturers list the eight most common food allergens. However, manufacturers of herbal supplements fall into a sort gray zone. Drugs and foodstuffs are heavily regulated, where herbal supplements generally need to prove only that a given product is fit for human consumption.

Every level of the chain is responsible in this case, but the lawsuits are targeting major retailers for failing to verify the quality of the products in question. In this, as in all else, it&#x2019;s best to be as informed as possible.

Ohio was ranked second in the nation for five-star rated nursing homes. Around 17% of the states&#x2019; facilities received the rating, the highest available. The national average of 5-star nursing homes is 21.7%. The lists are generally regarded as highly accurate, and make use of data provided by a program run by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.

The report also includes some excellent information on choosing the right nursing home, covering costs, and guaranteeing good care. Choosing a nursing home for a loved one is difficult at best; this resource provides excellent help when you need it most.
<h2>Choosing the right nursing home</h2>
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ohio-Nursing-Homes-Highly-Rated-300x200.jpg" alt="Ohio nursing homes highly rated" width="300" height="200">How do you know which nursing home to choose? Think about this:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Who&#x2019;s paying?</strong> If you are able to privately pay for a loved ones care, your options may be a bit more open. However, most facilities accept Medicare or Medicaid. The Veterans Administration has a benefit program to provide care for veterans and their spouses. Also, if the care is long-term, some facilities are open to negotiation.</li>
    <li><strong>Location, location, location</strong>. A large part of your loved ones well-being will include healthy relationships. If you have to drive several hours to visit, you may want to reconsider. Additionally, it&#x2019;s harder to ensure ongoing quality of care if you are unable to visit often.</li>
    <li><strong>It never hurts to ask</strong>. Once you&#x2019;ve done your research online, it&#x2019;s time to visit and look around. Ask residents what they think, and ask as many of them as you can. Ask if the facility accepts Medicare or Medicaid. Ask the nurses about their jobs and their patients. Ask about diets and food quality and activities.</li>
</ul>
Even the best facilities can make mistakes. Armed with these tools, the risk of abuse or neglect can be minimized but never eliminated. If your loved one has been the victim of nursing home abuse or neglect, please contact us for a free consultation.

As part of the campaign to end distracted driving for good, Attorney Crandall represented the End Distracted Driving organization (<a href="http://enddd.org/">EndDD.org</a>). The CFHS students took part in this interactive presentation by analyzing and discussing their own feelings about and experiences with distracted driving. They were then asked to have that same discussion with their parents and guardians.

EndDD.org also allows drivers to take the pledge to drive without distractions. The school offered a prize raffle for any students who took the pledge and entered their names.
<h2>April is Distracted Driving Month</h2>
Attorney Crandall&#x2019;s EndDD.org presentation could not have been timelier, as April is Distracted Driving Month. According to the organization:
<ul>
    <li>Car crashes are the #1 cause of unintentional fatalities in America, killing about 100 people per day</li>
    <li>Driver error is to blame for about 90% of all car crashes</li>
    <li>At any given time, 9% of the driving population is using a cell phone, which leads to approximately 26% of all car crashes</li>
    <li>&#x201C;The activity in the area of the brain that processes moving images <strong>decreases by up to 1/3</strong> when listening [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][or] talking on a phone,&#x201D; leading drivers to miss about half &#x2013; <strong>50%</strong> &#x2013; of what is moving outside of the car, <em>even when they are looking out the windshield</em></li>
</ul>
Part of the problem could be that different states have different laws &#x2013; and sometimes the laws against distracted driving vary from town to town. In Ohio, there is a &#x201C;<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/cellular-phone-use-and-texting-while-driving-laws.aspx">local option</a>&#x201D; when it comes to hand-held cell phone bans, meaning that there is no one law governing the entire state. However, drivers younger than 18 may not use cell phones while driving at all, and no drivers are allowed to text while they drive. Police will enforce the bans on texting as well as the ban on younger drivers using a phone in the car. In Kentucky, drivers under the age of 18 and school bus drivers are prohibited from using a cell phone while driving, and no one is allowed to text; the cops uphold and enforce these laws as well.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we believe that any steps we can take to eliminate unnecessary injuries and deaths from our communities are the right steps. We encourage you to visit EndDD.org to <a href="http://enddd.org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/">learn the facts</a>, and to take the pledge yourselves. If you have questions about distracted driving laws in Ohio or Kentucky, or if you want to learn more about becoming a presenter, we invite you to reach out to us today. Together we can save lives.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]

Firefighter and family man Daryl Gordon lost his life in the line of duty when he fell into an elevator shaft of a burning apartment building. Having served almost 30 years and just months from his retirement, Fire Apparatus Operator and Explosive Ordinance Disposal Technician Daryl Gordon lost his life doing what he loved the most &#x2013; saving lives.

Gordon leaves behind his wife, Angela and their two daughters, Angelique and Chelsea.
<h2>Protecting the community we love</h2>
Fire fighters are an integral part of our community. They are our heroes. They are the ones who are willing to run into a burning building and carry people out to safety. Every shift they know that their lives could be in danger, yet they are willing to step into dangerous situations every day to keep the members of their community safe from fires.

FAO Gordon&#x2019;s life work was keeping people safe from fires, so we&#x2019;d like to share these safety tips that can help prevent fires, and to help you keep you safe if a fire starts in your home:
<ul>
    <li>Make sure all of the smoke detectors and fire alarm system works in your building. A beeping fire alarm needs new batteries.</li>
    <li>Check for electrical hazards.</li>
    <li>Keep matches and lighters away from children.</li>
    <li>Never store flammable liquids in your home.</li>
    <li>Explore your building and be aware of all of the safety exists.</li>
    <li>Decide on a meeting place where everyone will meet after getting out the apartment.</li>
    <li>Never use the elevator in case of a fire.</li>
    <li>Rehearse an escape route with all of the members of your household.</li>
    <li>Once you have safely escaped a fire call 911 immediately.</li>
</ul>
According to WCPO.com, federal investigators will look into what led up to FAO Gordon&apos;s tragic line-of-duty death. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health will also take part in the investigation to determine if training or command played a role in fire fighter Gordon&apos;s death.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our thoughts and prayers are with FAO Gordon&#x2019;s family, fellow fire fighters and the three firefighters who were injured in the Madisonville fire.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2019" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nursing-home-neglect-200x300.jpg" alt="nursing home neglect" width="200" height="300">A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/business/as-nursing-homes-chase-lucrative-patients-quality-of-care-is-said-to-lag.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> article describes how, despite the promised luxurious amenities, many nursing facilities have a poor quality of care. There is a massive shift going on in the nursing home industry to appeal to short-term Medicare patients and turning away from catering to lower-paying Medicaid patients. However, in the rush to appeal to higher-paying Medicaid patients, it is the patients themselves who are losing out because many of these facilities do not offer the care that these patients need.
<h2>The crux of the problem</h2>
When elderly patients leave the hospital after an illness or injury, they often stay in nursing homes funded by Medicare to recuperate before going home. Medicare pays 84% more for short-term patients than these nursing facilities get for Medicaid patients, which makes competition intense to attract the Medicare patients.

But a 2014 report by <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-11-00370.pdf">the Department of Health and Human Services&apos;</a> Office of Inspector General found that 22% of Medicare residents experienced adverse events during their stay at a nursing home. (An adverse event is described as one that required a prolonged stay in the nursing facility, transfer to a hospital, permanent harm, life-sustaining intervention or death.) The report estimates that 21,777 Medicare residents experienced an adverse event, and 2.6% experienced more than one; some of those patients experienced three events during a single stay at a nursing facility.
<h2>Abuse and neglect of the elderly</h2>
The <em>NYT</em> article talks about the lofty promises of care that the Watermark at Logan Square nursing facility in Philadelphia made to Dr. Lois Johnson-Hammerman, who ended up being taken to the emergency room with a dangerously infected bedsore. She was promised hot baths and quality health care, but in reality she had difficulty getting the staff to bathe her, change her diaper and turn her every few hours to prevent bedsores.

In another sad example of neglect, Mary Dwyer, age 87, checked into the Harborview Healthcare Center after having fallen and dislocated her shoulder when she fell. The care Mrs. Dwyer received at the nursing facility was negligent, as described by her family. They did not feed her properly, they did not reposition her in bed frequently, and in just one month after she lost 20 lbs. and developed a bed sore down to the bone. She was sent to the hospital to get care for her injuries and died a month later. Her family won $13 million in a wrongful death action, which the nursing home is appealing.
<h2>Protecting your loved ones</h2>
If you must put a loved one into a nursing facility, here are a few tips from the National Institutes of Health to keep in mind:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consider</strong> what is most important to you in a nursing facility-- the quality of nursing care, the food, the physical therapy, connection to your religious faith? Is it important that the facility be close so that family and friends can easily visit?</li>
    <li><strong>Ask</strong> your friends, relatives, and social workers what facilities they recommend. Use their suggestions to make a short list.</li>
    <li><strong>Call</strong> each place on your short list. Ask about how many resident they have, what the costs are, and if they meet the priorities you considered earlier.</li>
    <li><strong>Visit </strong>the facility. Meet the director and the nursing staff.</li>
    <li>Ask questions. Look at the condition of the residents and notice if they seem well cared for and content. Does the place smell clean? Find out about the rate of turnover in the nursing staff, food service and social service departments. Finally, make a second, surprise visit at mealtime. Does the dining room look clean? Does the food look appetizing?</li>
    <li>Carefully read the contracts before you make your final selections. Talk with the director to get answers for your questions so that you are clear before you sign and pay.</li>
</ul>
Taking the time to select the right facility is vital in protecting your loved ones. If you have a loved one in a nursing home, visit as often as you can &#x2013; several times a week if possible &#x2013; to see the kind of care they are receiving. Be a constant presence and make sure that the staff knows that you are keeping an eye on your family members&#x2019; care.

If you have a loved one who has experienced abuse or neglect in a nursing facility, you may be able to take legal action against the facility. Schedule a consultation with a nursing home neglect attorney who can answer your questions and advise you of your rights.

Contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law today to discuss your nursing home negligence case. We&#x2019;ll give you the answers you need and fight to protect your rights.

In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration released updates on health complications from Lipitor, including risk of high blood sugar and development of diabetes. A study released the same year found the post-menopausal women taking Lipitor were at a <a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1108676">48% higher risk</a> of developing diabetes than those who did not take the drug.
<h2>What is Lipitor?</h2>
Lipitor, which is manufactured by Pfizer, is a statin: statins are prevent the body from creating the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is used by the liver to create cholesterol. By preventing the production of the enzyme, statin drugs like Lipitor can help lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke.

Lipitor was approved for use by the FDA in 1996, and quickly became the gold standard for high cholesterol patients. The drug is extremely effective. It is chemically designed to block the production of &#x201C;bad&#x201D; cholesterol and raise levels of &#x201C;good&#x201D; cholesterol.
<h2>Why Lipitor can be dangerous</h2>
Unfortunately, Lipitor is not nearly the perfect cholesterol drug it was believed to be. Pfizer did not properly indicate potential risks until 2012 &#x2013; <em>sixteen years</em> after the drug became publicly available. Lipitor has a relatively high risk of serious side effects, including:
<ul>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)</li>
    <li>Muscle and joint problems</li>
    <li>Myopathy (muscle tissue fiber damage)</li>
    <li>Rhabdomyolysis (severe myopathy resulting in muscle death)</li>
    <li>Liver disease or injury</li>
    <li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
</ul>
To date, about 2,000 lawsuits have been consolidated in the court of the District of South Carolina. The first of the bellwether trials (where a small number of cases are tried in lieu of all the cases, thus eliminating costly and time-consuming litigation while also giving the plaintiffs and the defendant, Pfizer, a good understanding of how a jury will find and how much compensation might be expected, should the jury find for the plaintiffs) are expected to begin in November of 2015. There is still time to file a lawsuit.

Medical side effects, though rare, can have serious implications. Taking Lipitor can have lifelong repercussions. If you or a loved one is currently taking Lipitor, please take the time to discuss these concerns with a medical professional. If you or someone you know has taken Lipitor in the past and suffered complications, please <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> to schedule a consultation at one of our multiple offices throughout Ohio and Kentucky.

Some of these drugs are injectable and some come in the form of a topical gel. While there are many options, one thing is becoming clear; the side effects are outweighing the potential benefits.

There is a legitimate market for these drugs. A condition called male <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-hypogonadism/basics/definition/con-20014235">hypogonadism</a>, in which a man&#x2019;s body does not produce enough testosterone, can be treated with testosterone supplements. The condition can be inherited or be the result of injury or infection. In these cases, testosterone supplements can be a lifesaver.

When testosterone supplements are prescribed for anyone not suffering from hypogonadism, however, the effects can be disastrous. Topical gels can transfer to sexual partners, boosting testosterone to dangerously high levels in women. Because of a massive amount of lawsuits against the makers of &#x201C;Low T&#x201D; products, a consolidated suit is pending in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Illinois.

The consolidated suit could have important ramifications; mainly, it hopes to effect changes in the ability of drug manufacturers to advertise directly to potential customers. The suit claims that manufacturers essentially created a condition (Low-T) by spending millions of dollars on advertising campaigns.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/arleneweintraub/2015/04/06/whats-next-for-the-thousands-of-angry-men-suing-over-testosterone/">According to Forbes</a>, &#x201C;AbbVie [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][the manufacturer of AndroGel] initially estimated that hypogonadism affects about a million men, but shortly after AndroGel was approved in 2000, the company announced that the market had grown to at least four million potential patients. By 2003, the complaint says, that number was 20 million. &#x2018;These numbers did not, and could not represent, the number of men with the conditions for which AndroGel is indicated, which are believed to be substantially smaller,&#x2019; the complaint reads.&#x201D;
<h2>Dangerous side effects</h2>
These topical gels can also cause a range of other side effects in otherwise healthy men, including:
<ul>
    <li>Prostate cancer</li>
    <li>Enlarged blood cells</li>
    <li>Reduced sperm count</li>
    <li>Edema</li>
    <li>Enlarged breasts in men (gynecomastia)</li>
    <li>Sleep apnea</li>
    <li>High cholesterol</li>
</ul>
If you are currently taking a prescription testosterone supplement or have taken one in the past, we advise you to contact a medical professional for a full checkup.

Going organic is one of the latest trends in health food; organic foods are supposed to be free of harmful pesticides and growth-enhancing drugs. However, growing foods without harsh chemicals can have unintended consequences. A recent recall by four organic food companies highlights this issue.

Amy&#x2019;s Kitchen, Rising Moon Organics, Superior Foods, and Twin City Foods have recalled products because of listeria-contaminated spinach from an organic supplier. Some of the products sold by Twin City Foods were re-sold later under the Wegman&#x2019;s brand name.

While FDA policy does not require the supplier to be named or to comment on whether it is investigating a particular issue, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/amys-kitchen-recall-spinach-listeria-outbreak/story?id=29894726">ABC News</a> reports that Coastal Green LLC of Oxnard, California supplied &#x201C;leafy greens&#x201D; to all of the above-listed companies. Spokesman for the company, Paul Fanelli, said, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re in the middle of an investigation here as to what the root cause was of the listeria. Once we determine what that is, we&#x2019;ll change our policies and our procedures accordingly.&#x201D;
<h2>The dangers associated with listeria</h2>
Listeria is a bacterial contaminant. If ingested, it can cause listeriosis, a serious infection. The elderly, newborns, pregnant women, and those with a weakened immune system are at higher risk, but anyone can be infected if proper care isn&#x2019;t taken to wash raw foods. Common symptoms of listeriosis can include:
<ul>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Stiff neck</li>
    <li>Confusion</li>
    <li>Loss of balance</li>
    <li>Convulsions</li>
    <li>Fever, fatigue, and headaches (in pregnant women)</li>
</ul>
According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/treatment.html">Center for Disease Control and Prevention</a>:

&#x201C;Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. A person in a higher-risk category (pregnant woman, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems) who experiences fever and other non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue and aches, within 2 months of eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the physician or health care provider about eating the contaminated food...Even with prompt treatment, some listeriosis cases result in death. This is particularly likely in older adults and in persons with other serious medical problems.&#x201D;

For a full list of the recalled products, we encourage you to visit the manufacturer&#x2019;s websites; Amy&#x2019;s Kitchen, Rising Moon Organics, Superior Foods, and Twin City Foods. These products are commonly distributed throughout the United States. Any organic food product containing spinach should be checked against a database. Any organic spinach products purchased recently should be thrown out. If you have any of the symptoms listed above, please seek medical attention immediately.

Listeriosis is a dangerous and potentially deadly illness. If you or a family member have gotten ill because of your food, or if a doctor failed to recognize the symptoms of the condition in a timely manner, Crandall &amp; Pera Law wants to hear your story. Please <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact the firm</a> to speak with a skilled liability lawyer at one of our multiple office locations throughout Ohio and Kentucky.

On arrival, paramedics were moving Charles Borton, 81, from his house to a waiting ambulance when they dropped the gurney, causing Borton to strike his head. Borton passed away three days later.

The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner recently released a report that listed skull and brain injuries as conditions related to his death &#x2013; yet the primary cause of Borton&#x2019;s death was heart disease.

Though the circumstances surrounding Charles Borton&#x2019;s death do seem a bit &#x201C;odd,&#x201D; it is possible that the head injury he suffered led to a blood clot, which could have led to his death. It is also possible that the trauma affected already weakened blood vessels or a strained heart, and no information has come forth disputing it. According to the American Heart Association, &#x201C;Heart and blood vessel disease &#x2014; also called&#xA0;<a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/MyHeartandStrokeNews/Coronary-Artery-Disease---Coronary-Heart-Disease_UCM_436416_Article.jsp">heart disease</a>&#xA0;&#x2014; includes numerous problems, many of which are related to a process called <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/WhyCholesterolMatters/Atherosclerosis_UCM_305564_Article.jsp">atherosclerosis</a>. Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when a substance called plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. If a blood clot forms, it can stop the blood flow. This can cause a heart attack or stroke.&#x201D;

Charles Borton&#x2019;s head injury could have exacerbated any number of heart disease-related problems, leading to:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Heart attack.</strong> A heart attack happens when a clot blocks blood flow to a part of the heart. If the clot completely blocks blood flow, heart tissue can be damaged.</li>
    <li><strong>Ischemic Stroke.&#xA0;</strong>The most common type of stroke happens when blood flow to the brain is interrupted. A stroke can cause irreparable brain damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Hemorrhagic Stroke.</strong> This type of stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. Hemorrhagic stroke can be the result of hypertension.</li>
    <li><strong>Heart failure. </strong>Heart failure can also be called congestive heart failure. As the heart weakens, it becomes unable to maintain an adequate amount of oxygenated blood to the body.</li>
    <li>Arrhythmia is irregular beating of the heart. Whether too fast or too slow, arrhythmia can cause a variety of health issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Heart valve problems. </strong>When heart valves don&#x2019;t work properly, they can allow too much or too little blood to flow through. In certain cases, heart valve problems can allow blood to flow the wrong way.</li>
</ul>
Or Mr. Borton&#x2019;s death could have been the direct result of his traumatic brain injury, and the case of death is listed as heart disease to avoid liability &#x2013; even though emergency workers are often exempt from liability when in the course of attempting to save a life, and the fall was ruled an accident. In any event, we wonder if this tragic case is not an example of post-mortem misdiagnosis.

The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm271924.htm">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> has warned that taking Zofran or its generic equivalent, ondansetron, while pregnant can cause serious birth defects. The product is still available because it has other uses, but pregnant women and doctors should be aware of the potential dangers of the drug.
<h2>What is Zofran?</h2>
The drug blocks natural chemicals that are responsible for nausea and vomiting. Zofran can be taken orally or intravenously. Zofran was originally intended to treat cancer victims suffering nausea as a result of surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Because the drug is so effective, doctors are turning to the anti-nausea treatment for pregnant patients experiencing morning sickness.

According to the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003119.htm">National Institute of Health</a>, morning sickness usually occurs for the first three or four months of pregnancy, and eventually tapers off. While uncomfortable and frustrating, morning sickness poses very little health risks unless it is so severe that the pregnant mother loses a lot of weight because of &#x201C;severe vomiting.&#x201D;
<h2>Complications with morning sickness</h2>
If the nausea is severe and accompanied by vomiting, doctors can prescribe an anti-nausea drug. Unfortunately, drugs like Zofran are more likely to be prescribed during the first trimester, when the developing fetus is most vulnerable. The studies surrounding the drug are controversial, but four main potential birth defects have been identified:
<ul>
    <li>Musculoskeletal anomalies, such as club feet</li>
    <li>Mouth deformities, like cleft palate</li>
    <li>Jaundice</li>
    <li>Heart defects</li>
</ul>
If you are experiencing morning sickness and your doctor decides to prescribe medication, it is important that you discuss any potential side effects. While the studies regarding the effect of Zofran on pregnant women may not all agree, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the drug&#x2019;s maker, GlaxoSmithKline, in 2012 for promoting off-label use of Zofran and other drugs. The lawsuit resulted in a $3 billion settlement.

GlaxoSmithKline readily admitted that the drug had not been tested on pregnant women; some patients taking the drug have reported rashes, shortness of breath, constipation, irregular heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, and difficulty breathing and swallowing.

If you were prescribed Zofran or its generic equivalent during your pregnancy, please <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> for more information.

Her radiologist failed to notice a cancerous mass that was visible on the images. In 2010, she was diagnosed with bone cancer and underwent surgery at OSU. She received no follow-up treatment from the center. Colcord later had to undergo further cancer-related surgeries.

Last month, OSU settled with Colcord for $800,000 in the Ohio Court of Claims. As a matter of course, OSU admitted no liability by settling the lawsuit. This information was published in <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/03/30/osu_settles_lawsuit.html"><em>The Columbus Dispatch</em></a>, but the story has not been picked up by media giants or even anyone outside of the state. The sad fact of the matter is that settlements like this are becoming all too common.

Medical malpractice can devastate patients and their families. This particular case of malpractice falls under failure to diagnose; had Becky&#x2019;s pelvic mass been properly identified in 2004, she would not have faced later surgery. The lack of follow-up treatment after her surgery is particularly inexcusable in light of the original failure to diagnose.
<h2>A cascade of additional problems</h2>
A cancer diagnosis causes fear, anger, and anxiety. Time is of the essence, as early detection can drastically affect the treatment outcome. When doctors fail to correctly diagnose cancer, they rob their patients of timely treatment that could have saved them from long, drawn-out chemotherapy sessions, surgeries or even a tragic death. Cancer misdiagnosis can be the result of:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mistakes made in the lab.&#xA0;</strong>If a lab technician makes an error or loses a culture, there could be a delay in the doctor&#x2019;s ability to recognize a cancer. Poorly or insufficiently trained technicians also increase the risk of a mistake, as do poorly maintained medical devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Failure to read the results correctly.</strong>Doctors who misread the lab results or ignore important elements of the results may diagnose a cancer patient with a different condition entirely.</li>
    <li><strong>Miscommunication between all parties.</strong>Failure to request or send medical histories, failure to include all parts of a test or failure to inform a patient about the results of a test could all lead to a delay in treatment. In some cases, a doctor who does not spend adequate time with his or her patients may not recognize that the lab results are wrong, or that the lab results actually belong to another patient.</li>
    <li><strong>Relying too heavily on past experience</strong>. While the experience of medical personnel is usually a benefit to patients, it can also sway a doctor or specialist to discount certain signs or avoid additional testing based on preconceived notions &#x2013; such as assuming a male patient&#x2019;s symptoms are not breast cancer simply because he is male.</li>
</ul>

Finding a nursing home for your loved one is never an easy process. A high standard of care and good reviews are a must, but these come with a high sticker price. Long-term care is more expensive than ever, making finding the right provider for your loved one more difficult than ever.

<a href="http://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/2015/04/20/aging-costs-on-the-rise-survey-says-a-614238.html">A recent industry survey found that</a> &#x201C;the median bill for a private room in a nursing home is now&#xA0;$91,250&#xA0;a year. This past year, it was&#xA0;$87,600, according to Genworth Financial, a&#xA0;Virginia-based life insurance company.&#x201D; The survey was based on 15,000 long-term care providers across the country. The findings were illuminating; prices varied greatly in different areas, with West Virginia averaging $107,631 for a year of care. That cost breaks down to just under $300 <em>per day</em>, which is far beyond the capabilities of most families.

With costs on the rise, nursing homes are catering to wealthier clients to help offset the high cost of care. For the less well off, these price increases and the associated quality of care can be the difference between life and death for an aging loved one.
<h2>How to pay for long-term care</h2>
There are alternatives to paying out of pocket. Medicare can cover short-term care costs and even home health aides, but will not help with long-term care. Medicaid can cover the entire cost of long-term care, but strict conditions must be met.

Additionally, the Veterans Administration Aid and Attendance assists veterans and/or their spouses. This little used resource can be a godsend when looking for quality care for your loved one.

Finding the right nursing home can affect your entire family&#x2019;s quality of life. There are resources to help you make that choice; we recommend the U.S. News &amp; World Report Nursing Home Search Tool. You can narrow your choices by region, by star rating (the standard 1 through 5 stars is applied) and by whether or not the facility accepts Medicare or Medicaid. You can also ask your doctor to make recommendations based upon your family members&#x2019; specific health needs.

Crandall &amp; Pera Law is proud to represent nursing home residents and their families when their rights have been abused. If you live in Ohio, West Virginia or Kentucky, and you or your family members has been abused or neglected in some manner, we invite you to <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact us</a> today.

That equates to one in three adults, and about <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm">half of these people use medication</a> to control their hypertension. High blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, chronic heart failure, and kidney disease.

Benicar (olmesartan medoxomil) is a common prescription drug used to control hypertension. While the drug does lower the risk of cardiovascular problems, this may come at a higher cost than anyone anticipated.

Benicar has been linked to severe gastrointestinal problems. The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm359477.htm">conditions caused by Benicar</a> include sprue-like enteropathy and villious atrophy, which destroys the finger-like villi in the intestinal that absorb nutrients from food. Symptoms can include chronic diarrhea, malnutrition and weight loss.

The side effects of Benicar are very similar to Celiac disease. Because of this, doctors can misdiagnose these side effects, which can have serious long-term health effects. A Food and Drug Administration report based on data from the Mayo Clinic called Benicar&#x2019;s side effects &#x201C;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538487/">life-threatening</a>.&#x201D;
<h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
While symptoms improved after stopping use of the drug, damage to the gastrointestinal system can be permanent. In addition to these severe effects, Benicar has been associated with:
<ul>
    <li>Abdominal pain</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
    <li>Kidney damage</li>
    <li>Liver damage</li>
    <li>Chest pain</li>
    <li>Arthritis</li>
    <li>Hair loss</li>
    <li>Angioedema (swelling of the skin)</li>
</ul>
Damage caused by the medication is not only serious in the short term, resulting in severe weight loss and malnutrition, but the long-term effects can accrue medical bills staggeringly quickly. When the villi of the intestine are damaged, it can become impossible for you to absorb necessary nutrients from food. In extreme cases, malnutrition can result in permanent organ damage and death.

Furthermore, Benicar may lead to fetal toxicity, making the drug especially dangerous to pregnant women. If the drug passes through the placental membrane, it could lead to developmental defects later. It could also potentially cause the death of your child.

If you are taking Benicar, we advise you talk to your doctor immediately. Other medications with less severe side effects are available. If you have experienced any of the side effects listed above from prescription Benicar and have found it necessary to seek medical attention, Crandall &amp; Pera Law is here to help you.

The transition from paper records to electronic records has many stumbling blocks, not least of which include data management. In addition, the complexities of new record keeping systems can be challenging to doctors and nurses; learning to navigate new computer systems is daunting.

An <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/electronic-record-errors-growing-issue-in-lawsuits-117591.html">article published recently in Politico</a> names EHRs as a main cause of medical malpractice cases in the eyes of insurers as well:

&#x201C;According to a review by The Doctors Company, the largest physician-owned U.S. medical malpractice insurer, EHR issues were involved in only 1 percent of a sample of lawsuits concluded from 2007 through 2013. But that finding could be deceptive since it takes five or six years to close a suit, and during that period the numbers of such cases grew rapidly as electronic health records become more pervasive in hospitals and physician offices. The pace of these cases&#xA0;<a href="http://www.thedoctors.com/KnowledgeCenter/Publications/TheDoctorsAdvocate/CON_ID_006908">doubled</a>&#xA0;from 2013 to early 2014.&#x201D;

The lawsuits allege a variety of mistakes, from typos to imperfect voice recognition, that result in medication errors and bad status updates. Sometimes, the information contained in an EHR does not link up with reality. &#x201C;In one case, a patient in septic shock had suffered gangrene and a severe skin rash, but computer records read &#x2018;skin normal.&#x2019; They also showed repeated physician interviews with the patient &#x2014; when she was comatose,&#x201D; according to Politico.

A spokesperson for the Electronic Health Record Association said the industry &#x201C;takes very seriously the need to enhance the well-documented ability of EHRs to increase patient safety. It also recognizes the importance of looking for opportunities to identify and reduce any potential risk associated with development and use of EHRs.&#x201D;

However, the commitment of the industry to making EHRs safer and more valuable does not help when faulty medical records or prescription errors put your or your family at risk. The errors go beyond typos and misuse; the complexity of medical diagnoses can be difficult to relate in digital form. When doctors take an EHR as gospel, there can be significant information gaps that lead to fatal misunderstandings.

It is vital to understand the role that EHRs play in medical malpractice cases. While they offer an opportunity to increase safety and help doctors make better decisions, it should be understood that EHRs are still very much in their infancy. We will continue to bring you more information about how EHRs can affect your standard of care. In the meantime, if you have been misdiagnosed or untreated because of faulty records, please <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> for a free consultation at one of our office locations throughout Ohio and Kentucky.

The hole is made to help you breathe.

A tracheostomy usually is temporary, although you can have one long term or even permanently. How long you have a tracheostomy depends on the condition that required you to get it and your overall health.

Tracheostomies are generally performed when someone needs to be on a ventilator for a significant period of time. Ventilators support breathing, and are connected to a trach tube that supplies oxygen-rich air directly to the lungs. During ventilation, it is also necessary to suction out naturally occurring mucus to keep the airways clear.

Ventilators are lifesaving machines. As with all medical devices,&#xA0;they carry an inherent degree of risk. In this case, anyone on a ventilator is completely dependent on a health care provider to keep them alive. Often the patient is unconscious and unable to alert anyone if a problem occurs.
<h2>The dangers of unclean equipment</h2>
Ventilators and trach tubes are made from medical grade plastic, but the warm, moist air from exhalation and the natural bacteria present in the throat can lead to bacterial colony growth in the equipment. If the tubes are not cleaned regularly, mucus can build up inside of them, ultimately cutting off the oxygen flow that ventilators are designed to provide. When this happens, hypoxia sets in quickly. If help takes too long, death will follow shortly thereafter.

According to the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000013.htm">U.S. National Library of Medicine</a>, permanent brain damage can occur after only four minutes without oxygen, and death can occur in as little as four minutes after that.

If your loved one is on a ventilator, it is important to be vigilant and ask questions about the standard of care they are receiving. Unconscious or infirm patients benefit from having an advocate. When accidents happen, we are here to be your advocate. Please <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> to learn more about your options if your loved one was harmed because of a negligent healthcare provider in an Ohio nursing home.

After the race, she experienced dizzy spells and went to Dedham Medical Associates to be treated. There, she was seen by Dr. Jehane Johnston. Johnston ordered an MRI and CAT scan, which showed brain abnormalities.

According to the <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/05/07/walpole-woman-awarded-million-medical-malpractice-case-lawyer-says/yxUOo2yzRNBZtVOzZSdvjL/story.html">Boston Globe</a>, these abnormalities required Johnston &#x201C;to place Larkin on a special list of patients with certain medical conditions that other doctors can access... Johnston failed to place Larkin&#x2019;s name on the list. When Larkin became pregnant four years later, her obstetrician was not aware of her brain issues because her name did not appear in the database.&#x201D;

Had Mrs. Larkin&#x2019;s obstetrician been aware of her condition, a caesarean section would have been ordered because of the danger to the mother during birth. Unfortunately, because of the Dr. Johnston&#x2019;s negligence, Mrs. Larkin delivered her daughter, Alexa, naturally. Within hours of Alexa&#x2019;s birth, Mrs. Larkin suffered a massive stroke, leaving her completely paralyzed except for some movement in her right arm.
<h2>Justice for the Larkins</h2>
Andrea Larkin goes to therapy sessions twice a week, but she requires caregivers and is mostly homebound. The Larkin family pays most of their expenses (such as for care givers) out of pocket, and it costs approximately $200,000 a year to get Mrs. Larkin the proper care she needs.

After years of litigation and endless medical expenses and experts, there is finally hope for Tim and Andrea Larkin. A jury awarded the family $35.4 million, finding Dr. Johnston and Dedham Medical Associates guilty of medical malpractice. Tim Larkin said he hopes the jury award &#x201C;can help bring some comfort to her moving forward to give her the best possible support that she needs,&#x201D; according to the Globe.

While doctors make small mistakes every day, what happened to Andrea Larkin and her family is inexcusable and devastating. A lack of accountability led to a mother being paralyzed and a family with mountains of medical expenses. We are happy that in this case justice was served.

Oxytocin is commonly administered to either induce labor or strengthen contractions during labor. While a Pitocin injection is generally considered helpful during difficult births, one study &#x201C;found that the use of Pitocin to induce or augment labor was linked to unexpected admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to lower Apgar scores,&#x201D; according to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/07/pitocin-risks_n_3224811.html">Huffington Post</a>.

The danger to an unborn child can be serious and potentially fatal. Once Pitocin has been administered, labor is either induced or hastened. If complications develop, or go unrecognized, the baby can be starved for oxygen.&#xA0; Stronger contractions can increase the risk of shoulder dystocia, uterine rupture and placental abruption.&#xA0; Doctors generally weigh the risks against the rewards and determine when Pitocin is necessary.

However, the numbers do not lie. The use of Pitocin during labor statistically correlates to a higher rate of problems for infants after birth. The Huffington Post also reported that &#x201C;Pitocin use appeared to be a risk factor for babies being admitted to the NICU and staying for at least one day. It was also tied to&#xA0;<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003402.htm">Apgar scores</a>&#xA0;of less than 7. A score under 7 is a red flag, indicating that the baby needs medical attention, but is not an indication that the newborn necessarily has a serious medical condition or that he or she will have lasting health issues.&#x201D;

Use of the drug comes with risks for mom too. Pitocin is administered intravenously, and both mother and child are carefully monitored during labor. However, it can have unintended side effects, especially in mothers who suffer from conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, arrhythmia, and more. Allergic reactions to Pitocin can additionally complicate labor. Common symptoms of an allergic reaction to Pitocin include:
<ul>
    <li>Fast, slow, or uneven heart rate</li>
    <li>Excessive bleeding long after childbirth</li>
    <li>Headache, confusion, slurred speech, hallucinations, severe vomiting, severe weakness, muscle cramps, loss of coordination, feeling unsteady, seizure (convulsions), fainting, shallow breathing or breathing that stops</li>
    <li>Dangerously high blood pressure (severe headache, blurred vision, buzzing in your ears, anxiety, confusion, chest pain, shortness of breath, uneven heartbeats, seizure).</li>
</ul>
At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we have helped parents and their children from around Ohio and Kentucky who suffered because of problems with Pitocin injections.

According to <a href="http://www.news-medical.net/news/20150423/Stem-cell-treatment-repairs-birth-defect-provides-facial-regeneration-for-people-suffering-traumatic-injury.aspx">News Medical</a>, the research has shown that stem cells actively encourage the damaged bone to heal. If the lab trials prove successful, doctors may be able to avoid complicated, high-risk surgeries where they break the skull into pieces and staple it back together (the current method for fixing the problem). Rather, &#x201C;doctors will be able to help people who have suffered disfiguring facial injuries and infants diagnosed with craniosynostosis through biological means instead of multiple, high-risk surgeries.&#x201D;
<h2>Additional applications</h2>
The procedure could take up to ten years to become publicly available, but it appears to be worth the time and effort. With a true cure for craniosynostosis, children who would otherwise suffer lifelong debilitating injuries could lead normal, successful lives.

Additionally, the procedure can be used to reduce or relieve the effects of:
<ul>
    <li>Open head injuries caused by piercing objects</li>
    <li>Facial disfigurement as a result of an accident or a physical altercation</li>
    <li>Encephalocele, the condition where a baby&#x2019;s brain may poke through a part of its skull</li>
    <li>Skull fractures caused by repeated or jarring hits to the head</li>
</ul>
Research like this comes along once in a great while,&#xA0;but scientists like this are the ones who help to make the world a better place. These findings will wind up saving lives and preventing needless suffering, but, unfortunately, they are still quite a long way off from being commonplace. Until they are, medical bills must be paid and birth injuries can lead to a lifetime of physical and emotional suffering.

The following is intended to be a back to basics approach to medical malpractice that will help to more clearly define the concept.
<h2>What is medical malpractice?</h2>
Healthcare workers and physicians are expected to provide a reasonable standard of care in any situation; from emergency room triage to childbirth and at every point along the way, our healthcare system has contingencies in place designed to maximize the chance of a positive outcome for any patient.

When healthcare professionals deviate from these contingencies, malpractice has occurred. Additionally, if other professionals in a given field agree that an action was unwarranted or unnecessarily endangered a patient, malpractice has occurred.
<h2>Common types of medical malpractice</h2>
Medical malpractice is a broad term that covers any number of incidents. Some of the most common forms of medical malpractice include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Failure to diagnose or misdiagnosis. </strong>A misdiagnosis, or worse, the failure to diagnose an injury or medical condition can lead to unnecessary pain and suffering. This pain can affect every surrounding a patient and lead to a decrease in the quality of life. Sometimes, errors cannot be fully corrected if too much time has passed.</li>
    <li><strong>Prescription and medication errors. </strong>From dosage errors to illegible handwriting, medication errors cause thousands of deaths every year, and even more injuries. Nurses, doctors and pharmacists may be held accountable for a medication error.</li>
    <li><strong>Emergency room errors.</strong> Emergency rooms can be chaotic places, but that does not mean the healthcare workers are exempt from the standard of care. Ignoring patients, misdiagnosing them, misreading their charts &#x2013; all of these can cause irreparable harm to a patient.</li>
    <li><strong>Surgery errors.</strong> From anesthesia mistakes to amputation errors to performing an operation despite open and obvious signs of risk to the patient, a surgical mistake can cause permanent damage to a patient. A doctor who performs a procedure in the attempt to save a person&#x2019;s life but fails to do so may not be guilty of malpractice, but a surgeon who operates under the influence &#x2013; even if the surgery goes perfectly &#x2013; is absolutely guilty.</li>
    <li><strong>Nursing home abuse and neglect.</strong> Caring for aging loved ones can be difficult and time-consuming. We often turn to long-term care facilities to provide for our loved ones, so it is doubly devastating to learn that your loved one has been abused or neglected by trusted professionals. Elder abuse or neglect is the failure of a healthcare professional to observe physical, behavioral, or emotional changes in a patient indicative of a problem.</li>
</ul>
While this list is hardly comprehensive, it does provide a concise idea of medical malpractice; namely, that malpractice is a failure on behalf of a healthcare worker or professional to provide an adequate level of care for you or someone you know.

Moore was a 19-year-old recruit when he arrived at Lackland Air Force Base last year for basic training. Doctors pulled him from normal training after test results revealed a genetic condition that can lead to sudden death during physical exertion.

Just 9 days later, despite the test results, Moore was running a mile-and-a-half test when he collapsed at the finish line. He was rushed to the hospital, where efforts to save his life failed. His mother, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/us/service-members-are-left-in-dark-on-health-errors.html?ref=politics">Anita Holmes, said</a>, &#x201C;I raised T. J. as a single mother on little income for 19 years, and kept him safe. They had him for nine days and sent him home to me in a box.&#x201D;

This past December, Anita received an official report on the death of her son after months of inquiries. The official Air Force explanation stated that the military followed proper procedure. The explanation admitted no mistakes and no fault.
<h2><strong>Why service members have a more difficult time</strong></h2>
Serious medical mistakes happen all the time, and sometimes getting an accurate version of what went wrong can be difficult, expensive, and time consuming. However, our active-duty service members can have an even more difficult time. According to the <em>New York Times</em>, they &#x201C;are in a special bind, virtually powerless to hold accountable the health care system that treats them.&#x201D;

Service members must use the military medical system; they are unable to seek outside treatment without specific permission. If a service member is hurt or killed during a medical procedure, there is no legal recourse. The Federal Government has immunity and damage caps from cases of malpractice. Because of this totalitarian power, there is no incentive to change a very badly flawed system.

Any errors made by military doctors are not reported to a national database, but are instead reported to an internal database, and then only if a patient is disabled or dies during treatment. Active-duty patients are stonewalled in their efforts to find out about suspected mistakes, and there is no law that allows these people their basic rights as a citizen.

Our military affords us a degree of freedom unmatched anywhere in the world. They keep our borders safe and provide law and order for an incredible number of people. However, our active-duty service members deserve the right to know when they have been wronged. We will continue to fight for that right and for all those who have been injured because of somebody else&#x2019;s negligence.

With the start of the summer approaching, we will all be spending a lot more time out of the house and in the sunlight. That means it is time to head to the pharmacy and facedown the confusion of picking up some sunscreen. With all of the choices of brands, and the varying SPFs and price points, sometimes you narrow your choice by which one has the best price and smells the best. But how do you know if it is effective?

An article by Consumer Reports outlines exactly what to look for, and narrows down their Top 15 choices. They recommend sunscreens which:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Have an SPF 30 (but be wary of numbers that are too high)</strong>. The FDA warns that any product claiming an SPF over 50 is &quot;inherently misleading,&#x201D; so choosing a product off the rack without doing your research first can hurt you. Still, you do not want a sunscreen which is too weak, either. Look into sunscreens with an SPF of 30 to start.</li>
    <li><strong>Block 97% or more of UVB rays. </strong>UVB is the Ultraviolet B spectrum of sunlight that causes redness in the skin and sunburn. The sun&apos;s UVB rays are higher in the summertime between 10am and 4pm, and they tend to damage the outer layers of the skin. Choose a sunscreen that provides sufficient UVB protection.</li>
    <li><strong>Provide broad spectrum coverage. </strong>UVA rays are always present in daylight all year round, and exposure to UVA rays accelerates the aging process. Those rays penetrate to deeper layers of the skin than the UVB rays. Exposure to UVA raises melanoma risk and can suppress the immune system. Broad spectrum sunscreen protects the skin from both UVA and UVB.</li>
    <li><strong>Are applied and re-applied every two hours when you are in the sun. </strong>The best sunscreen is the sunscreen that you actually use. Apply sunscreen after you dry off from taking a shower, and let it dry for 10 to 15 minutes before getting dressed to lessen the risk of staining your clothing. Re-apply sunscreen after two hours regardless of whether you see any redness, but also consider finding shade for a while to give your skin a break from the sun.</li>
    <li><strong>Are used in a ratio of 1 teaspoon per body part. </strong>Apply sunscreen liberally, using about one teaspoon per body part. Make sure you apply sunscreen to the inside of the arms and legs, the back of the neck and the tops of the feet.</li>
</ol>
A good sunscreen is the first preventative step to keeping yourself safe when outdoors. A serious sunburn is just as dangerous any other kind of burn, and in some cases could land you or your children in the hospital. Excessive exposure to the sun can also cause melanoma, a treatable yet still potentially deadly cancer.

We want everyone to stay safe and healthy this summer. If you do sustain an injury, we invite you to <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> to schedule a consultation at one of our offices in Ohio or Kentucky.

The study included data from 52,671 breech deliveries, and concluded that planned C-section is by far the safest method of delivery for breech babies.
<h2>What is a breech baby?</h2>
During normal pregnancies, the baby shifts around in the womb. Full-term babies naturally rotate so that the head emerges first during delivery. In breech babies, this shift has not occurred, and the legs or buttocks are positioned to emerge first. While vaginal birth is possible for breech babies, there are significant risks to the infant.
<h2>What the study found</h2>
This new study, lead by Dr. Janet Lyons of the University of British Columbia, has quantified those risks, and the results are incredible. Breech babies can be delivered one of three ways; planned C-section, C-section during labor, or vaginally. Those delivered by planned C-section had the lowest incidence of birth injury. Breech babies delivered by C-section during labor were 2.79 times more likely to be injured, while those delivered vaginally were 3.6 times more likely to suffer a birth injury.

Dr. Lyons told the <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/for-breech-births-c-sections-may-be-the-safest-choice/?_r=1">New York Times</a> that &#x201C;The role of the provider is to decide who is suited to a vaginal breech and who is not, and to make sure the woman has all the information to make a good decision.&#x201D; While the final decision is ultimately up to the parents, it is imperative that both parents be fully aware of the risks that a natural birth poses to a breech baby.

Vaginal breech births can have <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18803893">negative effects</a> on both mother and baby. During a vaginal breech birth, the baby isn&#x2019;t situated to minimize the pressures of labor, and can become stuck in the birth canal resulting in an emergency C-section. Additionally, the mother can suffer cervical or vaginal tearing from the unusual presentation that may require multiple surgeries to correct.

If you discover that your baby is in a breech position, the best single thing you can do is to be well informed. Consult with your doctor and your OBGYN to determine the risks to you and your baby. If you are uncomfortable with the conclusions, get a second opinion. There is everything to be gained by ensuring a healthy delivery for your child.

There is a big difference between congenital birth defects and birth injury. A birth injury, also called a birth trauma, is a physical injury to an infant that occurs during labor. While birth injuries are not terribly common, when they do happen the results can impact your child forever.

Birth injuries are complicated; not only in terms of the damage caused, but also in how the actual injury was allowed to happen. Pregnancy, from inception to delivery, often involves a large number of medical professionals, all of whom must share appropriate information at important stages throughout. From primary care physicians and OBGYN&#x2019;s to nurses and midwives, everyone must function as a team to ensure the health of your child.
<h2>Kinds of negligence</h2>
Childbirth is a delicate process from a medical standpoint &#x2013; though mothers in labor might find it otherwise. There are any number of problems that can arise in an instant, and the presence of a competent medical professional can be invaluable. Some of the more common types of birth injuries can include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prenatal negligence</strong> &#x2013; when screening or testing for certain conditions is omitted or improperly administered</li>
    <li><strong>Labor and delivery negligence</strong> &#x2013; when late-stage monitoring is not used or a healthcare worker fails to notice signs of infant distress</li>
    <li><strong>Negligent use of delivery tools</strong> &#x2013; when a vacuum or forceps causes physical harm to an infant when used improperly or in an untimely manner</li>
    <li><strong>Postpartum negligence &#x2013; </strong>when an appropriate standard of care is not administered to a vulnerable infant, resulting in severe injury or death</li>
</ul>
Most types of birth injuries are avoidable, which is all the more devastating to a parent left with a permanently disabled child. Birth injuries can be immediately apparent or take several months to manifest symptoms. In severe cases, infant death can result from improper care.

Birth injuries can and do result in lifelong conditions, including Cerebral Palsy, brachial plexus injury, and Klumpke&#x2019;s palsy to name but a few. Some of these conditions require lifelong medical care and support, and can be emotionally and psychologically devastating to a family.

If your family has been affected by a birth injury, you may be entitled to compensation for medical bills. Our experienced birth injury attorneys and registered nurses can be your family&#x2019;s advocate.

That is why we rely on our doctors to answer our questions &#x2013; often before we even know what we want to ask &#x2013; and assuage our fears about new medications, upcoming surgeries or potential illnesses. Yet ask any person who has spent time in a hospital, and you are bound to hear horror stories of doctors only coming in for a few brief moments, or being &#x201C;handled&#x201D; entirely by nurses and interns, of having questions left unanswered.

As it turns out, that lack of communication seems to have a direct correlation to which doctors are sued and which are not. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/upshot/to-be-sued-less-doctors-should-talk-to-patients-more.html?emc=eta1&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0">New York Times</a> looked into numerous studies over the past few decades, and found that the &#x201C;primary care physicians [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][who are] sued less often are those more likely to spend time educating patients about their care, more likely to use humor and laugh with their patients and more likely to try to get their patients to talk and express their opinions. It seems that more likable physicians are less likely to have claims filed against them.&#x201D; In short, the studies show that communication between doctors and patients can reduce the chances of those doctors being sued for malpractice.
<h2>Poor communication and a failure to warn</h2>
The findings make sense, even if the numbers do not: after all, there is no empirical proof that a doctor who talks to his patients is less likely to make a mistake than a doctor who does not. However, the <em>Times </em>found that in one study from 1992, about a &#x201C;third of respondents said that their doctor would not talk openly to them, half said their doctor had tried to mislead them, and <strong>70 percent said that they were not warned about long-term neurodevelopmental problems in their children</strong>&#x201D; who had suffered a &#x201C;permanent injury&#x201D; or who had died (emphasis ours). Thus, the leading reason in these particular malpractice cases is a failure to warn about the potential dangers &#x2013; after all, a doctor who fails to speak with his patients seems most likely to fail to give them pertinent information about the risks a mother and her unborn child may face.

But there is hope: in 2000, the University of Michigan instituted a new program &#x201C;to improve communication around medical errors. When errors occurred, the program encouraged physicians to tell patients about them, how they happened, and what would be done to make them less likely to occur in the future.&#x201D; In follow up studies done in 2010 and 2014, medical malpractice claims dropped by 36% and 58% respectively, and that the costs associated with litigation had dropped more than 60% in both years.

As medical malpractice attorneys, we can attest to just how poor communication often is between patients and their doctors. The <em>Times</em> article draws attention to a very important finding: namely, that patients can be better consumers of healthcare, and that doctors can be better purveyors of healthcare, if the lines of communication are open. A doctor who talks to her patients will likely have better informed and more satisfied patients, and could decrease her chance of being sued for malpractice over a failure to war or inform. It is certainly a start in the right direction.

Actively sedating a person and invasively altering an internal part of the body carries a relatively high risk even in routine cases. Competent professionals working together can minimize, and in most cases, eliminate, any major risk to a relatively healthy patient. However, care and responsibility don&#x2019;t end with the surgery. Post-operative evaluations can be crucial to the continued health of a patient.

Melissa Gravitt underwent surgery at age 36 to increase her chances of a successful pregnancy. During the procedure, her small bowel was perforated &#x2013; a serious problem, yes, but a commonly accepted risk for the procedure Ms. Gravitt was undergoing. The surgery was deemed a success and she was sent home.

According to <a href="http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/crime-courts/2015-06-11/jury-returns-157-million-verdict-medical-malpractice-trial">The Augusta Chronicle</a>, Ms. Gravitt went to an emergency room the next day complaining of high fever, racing pulse, and abdominal pain. Three days later she was back, this time with a distended abdomen and vomiting. Her doctor Peter Grossman admitted her to the hospital, but failed to order the CT scan that would confirm her perforated bowel for a further two days.

Because of Dr. Grossman&#x2019;s failure to recognize Ms. Gravitt&#x2019;s symptoms, she had to undergo further surgeries to correct the problems caused by the bowel perforation. On June 11, a Richmond County, GA Superior Court jury awarded over $1.57 million to Melissa Gravitt to cover the medical expenses resulting from her doctors&#x2019; negligence and pain and suffering.
<h2>Risks of abdominal surgery</h2>
If you have recently undergone abdominal surgery, or are planning on having abdominal surgery for any number of reasons, you are at risk of a bowel perforation. Untreated, a bowel perforation can lead to peritonitis, which can be fatal. Knowing the signs and symptoms of bowel perforation could save your life. The <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000235.htm">National Institutes of Health</a> recommends contacting a medical professional if you experience:
<ul>
    <li>Blood in your stool</li>
    <li>Changes in bowel habits</li>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Severe abdominal pain</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
</ul>
When a medical professional fails to recognize that symptoms or behaviors point to medical condition, they are guilty of malpractice. Malpractice can lead to unnecessary pain and suffering, as in the case of Melissa Gravitt. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we have successfully prosecuted a number of bowel perforation cases, including the Stamper verdict of $1.2 million that was reported by the <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/courts/2014/09/11/medical-malpractice-lawsuit/15460567/">Cincinnati Enquirer</a>.

Longtime former United States Congressman Steve LaTourette has recently been diagnosed with an advanced form of pancreatic cancer. This type of cancer is aggressive and our hearts go out to his family and loved ones, as well as to Mr. LaTourette himself. In fact, Mr. LaTourette may seek to preserve his testimony on video for the legal case due to the aggressive nature of the cancer he is fighting.

According to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/steve-latourette-lawsuit-federal-government-cancer-medical-malpractice-118338.html">Politico.com</a>, the former Congressman &#x201C;filed administrative claims against the government for what he says was negligent care from the Office of the Attending Physician of the U.S. Congress, which oversees lawmakers&#x2019; primary care&#x2026; [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][and] is planning to sue for past and future medical expenses, lost wages and compensation for his mental anguish and suffering&#x201D; stemming from his advanced pancreatic cancer. Mr. LaTourette believes the physicians caring for him were negligent and he now is seeking damages for this negligence.
<h2>A history of hurting constituents who filed cases like these in the past</h2>
Ironically, while in office, Mr. LaTourette was a huge proponent of tort reform and perpetually attempted to limit or even block a patient&#x2019;s right to sue his or her physician for malpractice. Looking at LaTourette&#x2019;s track record, it is safe to say that he has had a &#x201C;problem&#x201D; with medical malpractice cases in general, as well as the same type of plaintiffs&#x2019; attorneys he has now hired, for a long time.

<a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/OH/Steven_LaTourette.htm">OnTheIssues.org</a> records the voting record of the country&#x2019;s politicians in multiple areas. LaTourette has voted &#x201C;yes&#x201D; on issues such as &#x201C;restricting frivolous lawsuits (Sep 2004),&#x201D; &#x201C;limiting medical malpractice lawsuits to $250,000 damages (May 2004)&#x201D; and &#x201C;capping damages &amp; setting time limits in medical lawsuits (Mar 2003&#x201D;).
<h2>The heart of the matter</h2>
The numerous and restrictive barriers to justice and the ridiculously low caps on damages will now impact Mr. LaTourette and his family personally. Even if Mr. LaTourette&#x2019;s case is proven correct, he and his family will face severe limitations on the amount of damages he can receive as well as bars on the type of damages he can even ask for. It is certain Mr. LaTourette and his family will view the issues from an entirely different perspective. Hopefully Mr. LaTourette and his family can take this perspective and advocate what they now should know is the correct view; meritorious lawsuits should have no caps or limitations of any kind.

The problem is not that LaTourette wants to sue his doctor. Cancer misdiagnoses cases are incredibly difficult, and if it is a true case of malpractice than he and his family deserve to be compensated for the future they have lost. The problem is that LaTourette, and other lawmakers, should already know Tort Reform is incredibly wrong and unfair to anyone wrongfully injured by medical malpractice <strong><u>before</u></strong> they become a victim themselves.

Birth injuries can range from something relatively minor that will eventually heal, to severe injuries such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. But there are some indications that your child may suffer an injury that can be explained and detected before you go into labor, such as:
<ul>
    <li>Fetal Macrosomia (when the baby is much larger than he or she should be for his or her gestational age, or if the infant is heavier than 8 lbs. 13ozs, and the mother&apos;s pelvis is not large enough for the child&apos;s head to pass)</li>
    <li>Breech presentation</li>
    <li>Prolonged labor</li>
    <li>Induction of labor</li>
    <li>Use of epidural</li>
    <li>Delivery with instruments such as forceps and vacuum</li>
    <li>Premature delivery (before 37 weeks)</li>
</ul>
Babies who suffer severe injury at birth and survive will often face difficult lives filled with many challenges including developmental delays, cerebral palsy, cognitive difficulties and other disabilities. Raising a child with all of these health challenges can be costly and stressful. In some cases, the child will have ongoing medical needs that will cost the family a significant amount of money each month.
<h2>Can you pursue a medical malpractice lawsuit for a birth injury?</h2>
If your child is born with brain injuries or any other birth injuries caused by the doctor&apos;s or hospital&#x2019;s negligence, you may wonder if your case is eligible for filing a medical malpractice lawsuit. If you believe your child&#x2019;s injury was the result of negligence, or if the signs of a potential injury were there but they were ignored, then you may be able to bring a medical malpractice lawsuit on behalf of you child and yourself. The lawsuit can help you recover money for:
<ul>
    <li>Medical bills, such as hospital stays and surgical procedures</li>
    <li>Medication and prescription costs</li>
    <li>Rehabilitation costs, including tools and technologies you use in your home to care for your child</li>
    <li>Loss of income, both past, present and future if you must now care for your child full-time</li>
    <li>Pain and suffering of you or your child</li>
    <li>Funeral expenses if the injury should lead to a tragic loss of life</li>
</ul>
Living with a child with a serious birth injury can be challenging, but you do have options. We invite you to <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> in Kentucky and Ohio to find out more about your options.

As more baby boomers live longer and move into nursing homes in their later years, increasing numbers of people are being mistreated by the staff at these facilities. According to the Kentucky Elder Abuse Committee&apos;s annual report, more than 47% of patients in nursing homes (who have dementia) have been abused or mistreated by their caregivers.

Fortunately, there are several warning signs that you can look out for if you suspect that your elderly loved one is not being cared for properly, including:
<ul>
    <li>Infections</li>
    <li>Unexplained bruises and other injuries</li>
    <li>Medication errors</li>
    <li>Weight loss, dehydration, hunger</li>
    <li>Withdrawal from social activities, depression, fearfulness, lethargy</li>
    <li>Unsanitary living conditions</li>
    <li>Bedsores</li>
    <li>Missing valuables, money</li>
</ul>
If you see these or any other signs of neglect or abuse you are obliged by law to report it. You can report the abuse to the manager of the nursing home and you and report it to Kentucky Adult Protective Services at 800.752.6200. If it is an emergency situation where the individual has been seriously injured dial 911 immediately.
<h2>Preventing nursing home abuse</h2>
There is so much that you can do to prevent elder abuse. Educating yourself about the signs and symptoms, and encouraging others to learn them too, is a great first step in helping to end abuse and neglect. Remember:
<ul>
    <li>If you see signs of abuse, you should report it right away</li>
    <li>Visiting your loved ones in their nursing homes more often makes it more difficult for &#x201C;caretakers&#x201D; to abuse or neglect your family member</li>
    <li>Surprise visits at mealtimes can ensure that your parent, sibling or grandparent is both hydrated and properly nourished</li>
    <li>Keep an eye on your family members&#x2019; medications. Make sure that they are taking them according to the schedule and dosage amounts on the bottle</li>
    <li>Active listening is key. Be aware of any changes in attitude or personality, and ask questions about your family members&#x2019; experiences and happiness. Often, elders who are being abused or who have witnessed others being abused do not report it because they fear retaliation. Keep the lines of communication open, and look for a new home if your loved one feels unsafe.</li>
</ul>

The 2010 U.S. Census recorded the greatest number of people age 65 and older in all of the history of the census at 40.3 million, which is about 13% of the population of this country. By the year 2050, those age 65 and older will comprise 20% of the total U.S. population. Those who are age 85 and older are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population.

Along with the greater numbers of elders in nursing homes is the greater incidence of nursing home abuse. One of the ongoing challenges with identifying and curtailing this rampant abuse is getting people to report it. According to the National Research Council, only one in 14 cases of elder abuse is ever reported to authorities, which means that a huge number of cases of abuse, exploitation and neglect go unreported each year.

There are five general categories of abuse that our senior citizens endure every day at the hands of their caregivers including:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Physical abuse</strong>. Physical abuse can take the form of hitting, punching, kicking, shoving, restricting an elder to one room and using unnecessary restraints</li>
    <li>Any kind of unwanted, non-consensual sexual contact, touching and sexual assault</li>
    <li><strong>Psychological</strong>. Making threats, cursing, scolding and disparaging the elderly person</li>
    <li>Modifying documents without the elder&apos;s consent, forging and cashing checks, charging their account for unneeded services</li>
    <li><strong>Neglect</strong>. Neglect of a person in elder care can range from failing to maintain clean living conditions, insufficient access to medical care, neglecting personal hygiene, nourishment and hydration</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to report elder abuse in Kentucky</h2>
Kentucky is a mandatory reporting state, (KRS 209.030) which means that if you see or suspect elder abuse you are required by law to report it. You can call a toll-free number anonymously to report any instances of nursing home abuse in Kentucky: 800.752.6200. If you want to make a report about a nursing facility, you can contact the Office of the Inspector General at 502.564.7963.

If you have a loved one who has experienced abuse in a nursing home, you may be able to take legal action against the facility. Make sure that you have reported the abuse to the proper authorities and then talk to an experienced nursing home abuse attorney who will help you to hold the responsible parties liable for your loved ones&#x2019; injuries.

If your loved one has suffered an injury at a nursing home, we want to help make sure the responsible party is held liable for your loved one&#x2019;s suffering. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law we will protect your interests and help you get the justice you deserve.

Oxygen deprivation to the infant&#x2019;s brain can cause the most severe birth injuries. When the doctor fails to monitor the baby, perform a Cesarean section in time or commits any other preventable error, this can contribute to severe brain injuries in the infant.
<h2>Birth injuries by the numbers</h2>
In the U.S. approximately six to eight of every 1,000 infants are born with a birth injury, which means that 28,000 infants are born each year with a birth injury according to <a href="http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/">HCUP data</a>. The National Healthcare Quality Report lists the ten most common birth injuries in the U.S. as:
<ul>
    <li>Brachial plexus palsy</li>
    <li>Bone fractures</li>
    <li>Cephalo-hematoma</li>
    <li>Perinatal asphyxia</li>
    <li>Intracranial hemorrage</li>
    <li>Subconjuctival hemorrhage</li>
    <li>Facial paralysis</li>
    <li>Spinal cord injuries</li>
    <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
</ul>
As many as half of the birth injuries that occur in the U.S. are due to preventable medical errors.
<h2>Hypoxic brain injuries</h2>
Anoxia occurs when decreased oxygen gets to the brain; hypoxia occurs when anoxia goes on too long which then leads to irreversible brain cell death, also known as ischemia. Usually, these conditions are the result of decreased blood flow. Some of the more common causes of hypoxia include:
<ul>
    <li>Placental insufficiency</li>
    <li>Placental abruption</li>
    <li>Umbilical cord injuries or prolapse</li>
    <li>Congenital heart defect</li>
    <li>Too much medication used to cause contractions during labor</li>
    <li>Infections</li>
    <li>Shoulder dystocia</li>
</ul>
A hypoxic-ischemic injury can cause permanent damage leading to cerebral palsy and can even result in death. It is a rare birth injury that occurs in approximately three of 1,000 births.

Of the infants born with hypoxic-ischemic injuries, between 15 and 20% of them will die closely following their birth. Those who survive face a life of neurological problems such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, learning disabilities and mental retardation.

Discovering that your much anticipated new baby has been born with a life-altering birth injury can be devastating and heart breaking. If they live, these injuries will have a lasting impact on your child&#x2019;s life and their future. If your baby suffered a brain injury at birth, at Crandall &amp; Pera Law we want to help you get justice.

Recovering from a brain injury can be long and difficult process. Cognitive and physical therapies are time-consuming, and results often depend on the individual circumstances of the case. When someone suffers a brain injury, time saved is brain saved; the faster doctors can intervene, the better the chances of a full recovery.

In the past, it was believed that the best way to heal after suffering a brain injury was rest and inactivity, to prevent changes in blood flow and to allow injuries to heal as best as possible. However, a promising new study by a nurse in Cleveland may change the way doctors treat patients after a brain injury.

Kate Klein began working at the Cleveland Clinic&#x2019;s Neurointensive Care Unit some time ago. She noticed that the majority of patients were bedridden, and also knew that current medical practice has found that getting patients out of bed as soon as possible after an injury helped to promote healing. She began to wonder if there was a difference between bodily injury and brain injury.

In response, she designed and carried out a study on over 600 patients. During the year it took to conduct the test, Klein got more than half of her patients out of bed, sometimes on their first day in the ICU. Her findings were amazing. According to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/07/06/419519145/people-with-brain-injuries-heal-faster-if-they-get-up-and-get-moving">National Public Radio</a>, &#x201C;What she found was that getting up and moving had clear benefits. Patients who started their rehabilitation earlier spent less time in the ICU and less time in the hospital. &#x2018;They have less pressure ulcers, less infections and spend less time on the ventilator if they need ventilator therapy,&#x2019; says Klein. And most say they feel a lot better.&#x201D;

In response to Klein&#x2019;s efforts, the Cleveland Clinic has installed ceiling-mounted lifts to help get patients out of bed. The results have been nothing short of amazing. One patient, a mother, spoke for the first time after walking outside the hospital for the first time.

Doctors believe that the experience gained by performing routine tasks like walking down a hallway, sitting outside on a bench, or even getting out of chair help to promote brain healing. These familiar tasks engage the brain, and can begin to let the brain rewire itself to compensate for an injury. Doctors caution that this research is still in its early stages, and that not all brain injuries may respond the same way to this treatment. However, thanks to Kate Klein in at the Cleveland Clinic, there is more hope from brain injury victims than ever before.

When brain injuries happen, the medical costs can be staggering. Hospital stays, rehabilitation, and cognitive and behavioral therapy sessions can add up quickly. If you or someone you know suffered a brain injury during an accident, you may be entitled to compensation.

The <em>New York Times</em> has been publishing personal stories about the heart-wrenching experience of mothers delivering stillborn children. To the average person, such stories might seem too personal to share, the grief too deep to express properly &#x2013; but to the thousands of women whose children are stillborn, bringing the topic to light could offer some relief or catharsis. The<em> Times</em> reports that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/health/after-a-stillbirth-a-silent-delivery-room.html">1 in 160 pregnancies</a> will result in a stillbirth, which means the chances are high that someone you know and love will experience this terrible tragedy.
<h2>Potential causes for a loss</h2>
Dr. Eleni Michailidis, whose loss of her son Alexander is recounted in the article, states that approximately half of all stillbirths have no known cause. A stillbirth, referred to as fetal death in the medical field, occurs when a child dies in the womb after 20 weeks. If a child dies in the womb before 20 weeks, it is generally categorized as a miscarriage. According to the <a href="http://www.marchofdimes.org/loss/stillbirth.aspx">March of Dimes</a>, the other 50% of fetal deaths may be attributed to:
<ul>
    <li>Birth defects</li>
    <li>Placental abruption</li>
    <li>Physical trauma to the mother, such as a car accident</li>
    <li>Undiagnosed or untreated infections</li>
    <li>Chronic health conditions, including diabetes</li>
    <li>The advanced age (over 35 years) of the mother</li>
    <li>Obesity</li>
    <li>High blood pressure in the mother</li>
    <li>&#x201C;Multiple gestation,&#x201D; or carrying two or more babies at one time</li>
</ul>
With the exception of a car accident, which could not be anticipated, each of these scenarios can occur if a doctor fails to warn the mother of a potential problem. Many times, improper monitoring of a pregnancy &#x2013; high-risk or not &#x2013; may lead to the loss of the baby. In some of the most tragic experiences, however, it is the medical team&#x2019;s negligence during the labor and delivery process which leads to the wrongful fetal death. Failing to discover a problem with the umbilical cord in a timely manner could deprive a child of oxygen, leading to brain damage or death. Waiting too long to perform a C-section is another cause of stillbirths, especially if the mother presents with bleeding, a sign of placental abruption.

These are delicate and challenging cases; for many families, the pain is too new and too raw to think about much else. But if a doctor&#x2019;s negligence led to the stillbirth of a child, then that doctor should be held accountable for the loss. Furthermore, a mother may require additional medical procedures or treatments associated with the event. Perhaps most important, a family who has experienced the death of their child should have access to the highest levels of aftercare and counseling to help them regroup. All of these things cost money &#x2013; money which insurance companies will be loath to give unless their hands are forced.

The unexpected loss of a child is almost too heart-breaking to bear; discovering that loss may have been prevented cold be even more so. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we understand the challenges of these cases, and we understand how to win. Steve Crandall won the largest verdict in Miami County in a case involving a wrongful fetal death caused by a complication with the umbilical cord; Marc Pera won a verdict in Hamilton County for $2.25 million not long after, which remains one of the highest if not the highest verdict in the area for a stillbirth lawsuit. We have what it takes to help you at the moment you need help the most.

The Federal Transportation Department recently released two internal reports that detailed the course of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x2019;s investigation of defective ignition switches in vehicles produce by General Motors.

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/06/business/nhtsa-admits-missing-clues-to-gm-ignition-defects.html?nl=afternoonupdate&amp;emc=edit_au_20150605&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a> reports &#x201C;While the reports still focused blame for the defect squarely on G.M., the nation&#x2019;s largest automaker, they also included an unusually blunt assessment of mistakes made by regulators. The agency, for example, admitted it had clues of the defect that it did not pay attention to, and acknowledged that it failed to use its full authority to hold G.M. accountable.&#x201D;

The internal reports have caused a stir in Congress and are instigating a series of changes to the NHTSA&#x2019;s investigative procedures. However, the agency&#x2019;s new administrator, Mark Rosekind, told the <em>Times</em> &#x201C;that he had not disciplined or fired any government officials for their role in failing to force G.M. to fix its defective small cars before the automaker began recalling 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and other affected models in February of last year.&#x201D;

This is negligence of the highest order; at a minimum, hundreds of people were aware of the public hazard created by the defective switches and not one person took appropriate action.&#xA0; General Motors employees, including engineers and inside and outside lawyers, actively worked to hide the fact that a faulty ignition switch was present and killing people in their vehicles.

In addition, and even more inexcusable, the watchdog agency by the taxpayers and for the taxpayers mishandled evidence to such a degree that Senators are calling for agency-wide reforms. The agency admitted a failure to acknowledge evidence, and in doing so put unknown numbers of lives at risk. At every step of the way, the system failed those it was intended to protect.

Ultimately, we must question whether an agency so rife with error can self-correct. If no employees are going to be fired or disciplined for an error of such magnitude, is it possible that the same mistake can be made with same people in place? When this question affects millions, can we trust those who failed us in the past? In effect, who watches the watchmen?

If you or someone you know have been affected by the GM ignition recall, or have suffered needlessly because of the lack of action on behalf of a trusted government agency, please contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law for a free consultation. We maintain offices throughout Ohio and Kentucky for your convenience.

When politicians speak of tort reform, they try to appeal to a large base of voters by skewing the facts about lawsuits. They purposely make victims (and attorneys) sound like greedy penny-pinchers who are purposely &#x201C;gaming&#x201D; the system for a payday. And they do this so that people will vote for them, because they sound like they are advocating for justice.

But there is no justice in tort reform &#x2013; there never has been, and there never will be. All the proof you need is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/25/us/amtrak-derailment-victims-face-a-liability-limit.html">in the case of Kathryn Varnum</a>, a woman so severely injured in the May 12<sup>th</sup> Amtrak derailment that her medical expenses are already up to $200,000 and her treatment is still far from complete. She has already had multiple procedures (and may be facing more) after fracturing her hip, back and leg, and is largely confined to a wheelchair. She can no longer work, and the doctors cannot tell her when she may be able to return to her job. She is being cared for by her husband who was also seriously injured in the derailment, and is reliant upon her parents to help ferry her to various hospitals and appointments.

All of their money is gone, and there is no guarantee of more money coming in. And Ms. Varnum and her husband, Declan McFarland, risk receiving only a limited amount of funds because of a &#x201C;congressionally mandated cap on liability for Amtrak accidents can leave victims with enormous bills [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][and is] aimed at keeping railroad companies in operation when hit with major lawsuits.&#x201D;

In other words, Congress ensured that injured Plaintiffs could only sue for a limited amount of money.&#xA0; &#xA0;As Harvard professor John C.P. Goldberg explained, &#x201C;When Congress enacted the cap, it made the judgment that victims of large-scale railroad crashes will be among those who have to bear the cost of keeping Amtrak up and running.&#x201D; By limiting how much compensation Amtrak can provide, either through a trial or a settlement (they chose to settle), victims are essentially paying to help keep Amtrak running.
<h2>A history of choosing corporations over people</h2>
This is not, sadly, the first time victims will be made to pay. The <em>Times</em> cites a 2008 Metrolink commuter train crash that occurred in California; 199 people were injured and 24 people died. &#x201C;Judge Peter D. Lichtman, now retired, said an additional $64 million beyond the liability cap was needed to properly compensate victims&#x2026;. But he was unable to get more because of the federal limit on damages.&#x201D; Judge Lichtman was forced to decide which family &#x201C;deserved&#x201D; more money, even if it meant taking away compensation from other victims.

The Amtrak case highlights the true problem with capping damages: the victims are hurt all over again. Damage caps make the injured parties help bear the cost of keeping a corporate entity up and running even though it has acted negligently. The same is true for medical malpractice caps, too. It is incredibly insulting at best and unjust and unfair at worst. Tort reform may be needed in some jurisdictions, but caps are almost never the answer. &#xA0;Victims&#x2019; ability to obtain the help they need to move forward, after horrific losses and suffering, should not be limited by arbitrary caps.

Dawn Miller, 33, of Hankins, New York recently pled guilty &#x201C;<a href="http://poststar.com/news/blotter/former-nursing-home-worker-sent-to-prison-for-theft/article_3461afea-22fd-11e5-8f7b-cb983d9a2204.html">to scheme to defraud</a>&#x201D; for thefts she perpetrated during her employment at Indian River Nursing Home in Granville. Miller was sentenced to 1 to 3 years in state prison and was ordered to pay restitution for the nearly $4,500 she stole from residents. According to the Post Star, &#x201C;She was found to have taken money from numerous residents&#x2019; personal accounts and to have created fake paperwork indicating it was used for legitimate purposes.&#x201D;

This story sheds light on one of the more insidious forms of nursing home abuse; namely, that not all negligence involves the physical care of patients. Your elderly family members are also at risk of having their money stolen from them, making it impossible to ensure their continued care. Financial abuse is a particularly difficult subject, as it requires monitoring your loved one&#x2019;s assets and proving that improprieties exist. If your loved one suffers from dementia, it can be even more difficult to trace a chain of events.
<h2>Common signs of abuse and neglect</h2>
Financial abuse carries its own particular set of symptoms, and they may not be immediately recognizable. Often times, elderly patients&#x2019; accusations are ignored by family members who are not intimately familiar with their loved one&#x2019;s finances. This is especially true in cases where one parent is in a nursing home and the other is not; if you cannot access your parents&#x2019; accounts, you may not realize they are being drained until it is too late.

In order to protect your family members, familiarize yourself with their finances, and look out for missing items and any transactions that are out of the ordinary. If you see new charges to an account, it is reasonable to request that the facility explain any new or different charges. Listen carefully to what your loved ones say, and pay particular attention if your loved one mentions that something might be missing.

If you or someone you know has been the victim of elder abuse, it is important that you take action as soon as possible. Crandall &amp; Pera Law serves clients in nursing homes throughout Kentucky, and our experienced legal team can help guide you through the steps you need to take to protect your loved one.

A new article from the <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2410">British Medical Journal</a> published on June 10 recommends that guidelines for Cesarean delivery as a delivery method should be reviewed. The recommendation is made in light of new evidence that links C-sections with childhood chronic disease and long-term health issues.

Dr. Jianmen Liu of Peking University and Dr. Jan Blustein of New York University&#x2019;s School of Medicine reviewed a series of studies that linked C-sections and chronic health issues. During the review, the team found some 20 studies that connect Type 1 diabetes with C-sections, 23 that linked the delivery method to asthma, and 9 related to obesity.
<h2>Understanding the risks with C-sections</h2>
In some cases, a Cesarean section is a potentially life-saving medical procedure &#x2013; for both the baby and the mother. It allows for safe delivery during complicated births, and can help prevent debilitating conditions caused by anoxia or hypoxia, where the baby does not get enough oxygen to his or her brain and suffers permanent brain damage as a result.

However, C-sections are still surgical procedures, and that means there will be risks to the mother and the child. If a surgeon cuts too deeply or in the wrong spot, both the baby and the mother could risk permanent scarring or excessive bleeding. The study references &#x201C;caesarean [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][sections as being] associated with increased risk of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit,&#x201D; especially if the procedure was not planned, or if the child had to be delivered prematurely.

If the procedure is delayed and the doctor must now rush, if the anesthesiologist makes an error, or if there is a secondary problem that is not addressed by the medical providers, both mother and child are at potential risk for life-long repercussions.

Choosing a C-section can affect both your life and the life of your child forever. Making an informed decision can mean the difference between a healthy child and a sickly one. We invite you to <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> to learn more, or to learn whether your child may have been the victim of labor or delivery negligence.

The facility was found to have been dangerously understaffed. The Office of Inspector General released a 700-page report on the conditions. Some of the problems, cited by <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/07/13/feds-cut-funds-louisville-nursing-home/30108299/">The Courier-Journal</a>, included:
<ul>
    <li>&#x201C;Insect infestations that left two residents- one a quadriplegic- screaming for help from staff because of ants crawling on them in a bed.</li>
    <li>Chronic staff shortages that one nurse described as &#x2018;ghost staffing,&#x2019; workers listed on schedules who were not actually on duty.</li>
    <li>Unattended or unexplained injuries, including a resident&#x2019;s broken leg apparently suffered in a fall, an injury that went undetected for 16 hours.</li>
    <li>Rooms and units that reeked of urine, clogged toilets, feces smeared on floors and in bathrooms and residents who complained of being forced to lie for hours in their own urine because no one was available to help them to a bathroom or change them.&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
In addition to the cessation of funds, the facility is to be fined $629,000 for a variety of violations. Florida-based Consulate Health Care operates the nursing home, and it is unknown whether it will remain open in the future. Federal funding will continue until August to allow state officials and families time to relocate their loved ones to other facilities.

This case, which unfortunately required federal intervention to resolve, constitutes elder abuse and neglect to the highest degree. At the Hurstbourne Care Center, some residents were unable to eat without assistance and were at risk of malnutrition without that aid. According to the investigative report, &#x201C;One resident at risk of choking was observed eating a paper napkin.&#x201D;

When major care providers operate health facilities with an eye on the bottom line, people suffer. While it pays to research and prepare to move your loved one to a nursing home or full-time care facility, you ultimately must trust a caregiver with your loved ones&#x2019; life. When a caregiver betrays that trust, we are here to protect your rights and get you the compensation you deserve.

Doctors are not sure exactly what causes gestational diabetes, but fluctuating hormones in both your body and in the placenta can block the effectiveness of naturally secreted insulin and cause elevated sugar levels. When this happens, both you and your baby are at a higher risk of complications during birth.

The good news, of course, is that gestational diabetes, properly known as gestational diabetes mellitus, is manageable and treatable. While Mom may be more susceptible to developing diabetes after pregnancy, the odds of a successful delivery are higher than ever before.
<h2>Potentially dangerous drugs</h2>
Gestational diabetes mellitus is considered Type II diabetes, in which the body manufactures insulin but does not use it properly to control sugar levels. There are many different types of drugs that are available to treat Type II diabetes, all with their own merits. However, <a href="http://injurylawyer-news.com/2015/07/glyburide-tied-higher-gestational-diabetes-birth-injury-risk-insulin/">a new study</a> has linked Glyburide to a higher risk of complications in newborns.

The study, which included 9,000 women, looked at the differences between natural insulin therapy and prescription Glyburide during pregnancy. The findings are nothing short of incredible; when pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes were treated with Glyburide, the risk of complications during pregnancy went through the roof.

According to the study, infants whose mothers received glyburide during pregnancy, were:
<ul>
    <li>41% more likely to be admitted to NICU</li>
    <li>40% more likely to have hypoglycemia</li>
    <li>63% more likely to suffer respiratory distress</li>
    <li>50% more likely to be delivered via cesarean than a natural birth</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2211139">The study concluded that</a>, &#x201C;Newborns from privately insured mothers treated with glyburide were more likely to experience adverse outcomes than those from mothers treated with insulin. Given the widespread use of glyburide, further investigation of these differences in pregnancy outcomes is a public health priority.&#x201D;

If you or your spouse was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during pregnancy and were treated with glyburide, and your child suffered birth defects or complications, we can help protect you and your child.

An Oklahoma mother sent her 5 and 7-year-old sons off to daycare for a day of fun at a splash park. Before the trip, Shaunna Broadway called Happiness is Learning to find out if she was required to provide sunscreen for her fair-skinned boys. She was assured that the facility would supply sunscreen and take proper precautions. When Broadway picked them up after the trip, the boys were crying in pain.

Connor and Trae Broadway suffered second- and third-degree burns after the daycare failed to supply and apply sunscreen. They were airlifted from an emergency room to a burn hospital in Texas, and are undergoing treatment for their painful injuries.

The Happiness is Learning Center has since shut down, and has remained unavailable for comment to the major media sites. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/28/health/boys-sunburn-daycare-irpt/">According to CNN</a>, &#x201C;The day care service has been visited in the past... for a list of non-compliance violations. These violations include expired fire extinguishers, incorrectly placed and updated food menu, and &#x2018;no one on staff with a current director&#x2019;s credential.&#x2019;&#x201D;
<h2>Why sunburns are more serious than you might think</h2>
Second-degree burns are serious. The first two layers of skin are damaged, and if the burn is larger than 3 inches in diameter, it is treated as a major burn that needs professional attention. Third-degree burns are far worse, and extend through all layers of the skin and underlying fat. These burns can require skin grafts to repair the worst of the damage. Both boys developed blisters from their burns so severe, that CNN issued a warning on its website for viewer discretion.

While the immediate damage from a burn is painful, repeated burns can have long-term health effects. This makes a new social media trend all the more worrisome. A recent article from <a href="http://6abc.com/health/sunburn-art-becoming-dangerous-new-trend-on-social-media/856394/">ABC Action News</a> highlighted a growing fashion trend in which teens are using stencils and sunblock to burn tattoos on to their skin. This new trend, popularizing a dangerous condition, has potentially disastrous consequences. The best way to counter this trend is to monitor and inform your friends and family. Repeated and extreme exposure to UV rays can result in skin cancer, while even brief exposure can cause painful burns.

If your children have been exposed to dangerous conditions, or injured due to an Ohio or Kentucky care facility&#x2019;s negligence, you may be entitled to compensation. Please stay safe, and <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> today for a free consultation.

A civil complaint has been filed on behalf of dozens of insurance companies. The complaint alleges a huge national health care fraud scheme involving the use of, and billing for, fake surgical hardware, and implicates fifteen surgeons and seventeen hospitals across the country.

According to the complaint, Spinal Solutions, LLC, of California, engaged in the production and distribution of fake spinal implants as long ago as 2007. The company would then sign an agreement to have doctors implant their non-FDA approved devices and pay kickbacks to those who participated.

The doctors involved allegedly entered into &#x201C;sham agreements&#x201D; with Spinal Solutions. For example, &#x201C;...Maryland surgeon Dr. Randy Davis entered into a &#x2018;sham agreement&#x2019; with Spinal Solutions and was paid $458,962 in kickbacks in exchange for getting the... products used in surgeries at the University of Maryland&#x2019;s Baltimore Washington Medical Center,&#x201D; according to <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2015/5/28/lawsuit-allegation-fake-spinal-parts-used.html">Aljazeera America</a>.

What may be worse is the level of conscious participation these agreements required. The fake spinal parts were delivered via private jet, and the surgeons participating in this counterfeit ring are alleged to have received cash, vacations, free plane trips, and other kickbacks for implanting the fake medical devices.

The healthcare facilities that are implicated participated by falsely justifying surgeries and deliberately ignoring the activities of surgeons and their supply chain. These hospitals then billed insurance companies as if the parts were from an approved source, sometimes marking up the false products as much as 250%.

On top of this, patients who were implanted with the fake devices may have a difficult time finding out. Paper trails were complicated and, allegedly, intentionally obscured. Scott Lederhaus, the president of the Association for Medical Ethics, said, &#x201C;This has got to end. The spine industry is corrupt and it needs a washing from top to bottom.&#x201D;

Participation in this counterfeit ring is gross negligence to the highest degree. Medical facilities and surgeons agreed, with intent and knowledge aforethought, to put patients at risk by using untested, unapproved medical devices&#xA0;purely for financial gain. The fact that they betrayed the trust of their patients and did not consider the potential lifelong ramifications of implanting fake medical devices shows the degree of their negligence, and those affected deserve to be compensated.

Diversicare of Nicholasville has received the largest fine in recent years after a January inspection found that an outbreak of scabies went on for months and affected 45% of residents. The facility was fined $891,350 because of the operators&#x2019; unwillingness to respond to nurses and their supervisors complaints about residents with rashes.

One of the residents had to be hospitalized, and others developed bacterial infections. This is an extreme case of elder neglect, and the federal government responded with an equally extreme fine. These residents, under Diversicare&#x2019;s care, were unable to speak for themselves, and the facility neglected even to respond to the nurses who attempted to speak on their patients&#x2019; behalf.
<h2>What is scabies?</h2>
Scabies is caused by a burrowing mite called <em>Sarcoptes scabei</em>. As the mites burrow into the skin, they cause intense itching which can result in red, irritated rashes. While the condition isn&#x2019;t fatal on its own, it is extremely uncomfortable. The mites can cause breaks in the skin, leaving the victim vulnerable to bacterial infections and other conditions.

<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scabies/basics/definition/con-20023488">According to the Mayo Clinic</a>, &#x201C;Scabies is contagious and can spread quickly through close physical contact... Because of the contagious nature of scabies, doctors often recommend treatment for entire families or contact groups.&#x201D; The facility, the report said, failed to wash linens and did not properly disinfect rooms and furniture.

Scabies is easily treatable with prescription creams. The ease of resolving the infestation makes the conditions at Diversicare all the worse. According to Kentucky.com, &#x201C;33 residents... were infested with scabies...Nearly all of the infested senior citizens were listed as having moderate to severe cognitive impairments.&#x201D;

Elder abuse and neglect is a serious matter. When you choose a nursing home for your loved ones, you are placing their health and well-being in the hands of trusted professionals. When that trust is breached, you are entitled to compensation for the physical and emotional suffering of your loved one and your family members.

Medical malpractice can devastate patients and their families. When a doctor is guilty of malpractice, he or she has failed to administer an appropriate standard of care. Malpractice comes in many forms, and it is much more prevalent that you think.

A report by <a href="http://www.businessreviewusa.com/finance/5070/How-hospitals-can-avoid-medical-malpractice-suits">Business Review USA</a> says, &#x201C;According to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), medical negligence is the third leading cause of death in the U.S., and the number of medical malpractice suits filed each year is more than 85,000. Among fatal medical injuries, 12,000 individuals die during an unnecessary surgery and 7,000 from medication errors...&#x201D; Unless something changes drastically, it does not seem likely that these numbers will change.
<h2>What constitutes medical malpractice?</h2>
While there are many different circumstances that fall under the category of medical malpractice, all have one thing in common; a doctor or healthcare provider failed to act reasonably. In other words, a doctor did not act as a reasonably careful doctor should have in those circumstances.

Some of the more common areas of medical malpractice include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Birth injuries.</strong> Birth injuries and birth trauma are almost always the result of inattention to detail during labor. Birth injury or trauma can have lifelong consequences.</li>
    <li><strong>Failure to diagnose and misdiagnosis. </strong>Failure to diagnose can allow a disease to progress and become untreatable. Mistaking one condition for another can have similar effects, and both can be fatal.</li>
    <li><strong>Medication errors. </strong>Over- or under-dosing can have a serious effect on your health or recovery. Being prescribed the wrong medication entirely can be disastrous.</li>
    <li><strong>Emergency room errors.</strong> Prompt treatment can minimize damage and promote faster recovery. The wrong treatment can turn even minor injuries into life-threatening conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Dangerous drugs&#xA0;and defective devices. </strong>Whether your doctor did not adequately research your condition or new information has come to light, your life can be altered when medicine goes wrong.</li>
    <li><strong>Nursing home abuse or neglect. </strong>The elderly are at higher risk of abuse or neglect because they may lack the ability to be their own advocates.</li>
</ul>

In early June, a tractor-trailer carrying 2,200 piglets overturned on Rt. 35 in Xenia, Ohio. The single vehicle accident caused only minor injuries to the driver and passenger. However, the cargo caused no small problem for authorities in Xenia Township.

According to <a href="http://abc7chicago.com/news/-big-rig-wreck-spills-thousands-of-piglets-on-highway/774719/">ABC7 News</a>, &#x201C;Numerous agencies and volunteers worked to corral the animals after the rash Monday night on U.S. Route 35 in Xenia Township, near Dayton. Crews picked up the squealing pigs by their hind legs. They were taken to Greene County Fairgrounds. Authorities say... some of the animals ran into a nearby wooded area.&#x201D;

This recent mishap highlights a rarely mentioned aspect of big rig wrecks; namely, that the cargo itself can be hazardous. Details surrounding the accident are unclear, but pending an investigation it appears that the driver lost control during the last leg of his trip from South Carolina. Driver fatigue was likely a factor.

Big rigs are dangerous, and not only because they represent up to 80 tons hurtling down the road at highway speeds. Mechanical failures, load shifting, and human error can wreak havoc on roadways and with traffic when these trucks crash.

In this case, the roadway had to be closed to facilitate the cleanup of livestock. The accident left between 300 and 400 piglets dead, with the rest running around a busy highway and the surrounding woods. If this truck had been carrying hazardous materials instead, a full HAZ-MAT crew would have been required to respond to the accident and the repercussions could have been far more severe.

When trucks spill their load, they can create road hazards and obstacles that drivers are not used to seeing. Luckily, this accident happened at night in a relatively low traffic area. Had it happened in broad daylight on a major highway, the damages could have been much worse.

Whether the cause is driver fatigue or a mechanical mishap, the company that owns the truck is responsible for any damages caused. The driver in this case has since <a href="http://www.whio.com/news/news/local/semi-crashes-on-us-35-west-at-xenia/nmYcr/">lost his license</a>. Accidents happen, and when big trucks are involved, the consequences are usually disastrous.

BODY:
Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey, a Canadian pharmacologist instrumental in preventing birth injuries from medications, <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/849632">died on August 7</a> at the age of 101. Dr. Kelsey&#x2019;s passing is notable because of her lifetime of work protecting the public from dangerous drugs and medications. Her most notable accomplishment led to the ban of thalidomide in the U.S.

Dr. Stephen Ostroff, acting commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said of her passing, &#x201C;Our nation lost a true pioneer in public health and consumer protection.&#x201D; Because of her efforts, countless birth defects were prevented and the United States passed legislation that gave rise to the modern regulatory practices of the FDA.
<h2>Her history with the FDA</h2>
Dr. Kelsey began working for the FDA in 1960; one of her first assignments was to review an application to allow Richardson-Merrill to sell thalidomide, a tranquilizer and painkiller intended to reduce morning sickness in pregnant woman, in the United States. Despite its popularity in other countries and pressure from the company to approve the drug, Dr. Kelsey insisted further research was necessary.

Her efforts led to the discovery that thalidomide dramatically affected a fetus and caused serious birth defects. Children of mothers who took thalidomide during pregnancy were born without limbs and sometimes did not survive birth. At her insistence, thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States.

John F. Kennedy presented Dr. Kelsey with a President&#x2019;s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service in 1962. In 2000, she was inducted into the National Women&#x2019;s Hall of Fame. Dr. Kelsey retired in 2005 after 45 years in the service of public health. Because of her work, an entire generation was spared the emotional anguish and lifelong suffering that thalidomide caused in other countries.

Today, the FDA&#x2019;s drug-approval process is far more stringent and complex than it was in 1960. This is due, in part, to Dr. Kelsey&#x2019;s efforts and her insistence that the public be protected whatever the cost:

&#x201C;Her efforts on thalidomide fueled the passage of legislation giving the FDA greater oversight and regulation of pharmaceutical products, requiring drug companies to conduct phased clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy of a new drug, in addition to safety, obtain informed consent from participants, and report side effects to the FDA. The regulations also gave the FDA greater control over drug advertising.&#x201D;

While the procedures are still imperfect, they have protected countless lives and prevented needless suffering.

Dr. Ostroff said, &#x201C;Our nation owes a great debt of gratitude to Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey for her decades of service to public health.&#x201D; We at Crandall &amp; Pera Law would like to add our own thanks to Dr. Kelsey. Without her, untold numbers of children would never have had a chance at life, and countless more would be at risk without the protections afforded by the FDA.&#xA0; While the struggle continues to refine the system, mistakes can be made; if you or someone you know has suffered because of a faulty medication or medical device, please contact us today to schedule an appointment in one of our Ohio or Kentucky offices.

The National Football League recently agreed to pay former players nearly $1 billion in compensation to settle the class action lawsuit against them. The plaintiffs were <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/22/us/nfl-concussion-lawsuit-settlement/">more than 5,000</a> former NFL players who were &#x201C;suffering from dementia, depression or Alzheimer&apos;s that they blamed on blows to the head&#x201D; and started the class action suit against the NFL, &#x201C;accusing it of concealing the dangers of concussions and rushing injured players back onto the field while glorifying and profiting from the kind of bone-jarring hits that make for spectacular highlight-reel footage.&#x201D; The final approval on the settlement came this past April from a federal judge.

Some people are incredibly angry at Roger Goodell, for putting the NFL&#x2019;s profits before its players. Some people blame the players themselves, accusing them of being greedy. Some people want to end football forever; some want to change the rules; some want to say that there&#x2019;s no excuse now, and that playing football when you know the dangers is no different than lighting a cigarette or driving drunk.

However, regardless of your position, this much is crystal clear: we all now have definitive proof that repeated blows to the head &#x2013;&#xAD; even those which do not cause a concussion &#x2013; cause a devastating brain injury called Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is &#x201C;a progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in athletes (and others) with a history of repetitive brain trauma, including symptomatic concussions as well as asymptomatic subconcussive hits to the head.&#x201D; At this point, whether or not the NFL or its doctors knew about the dangers they placed their athletes in is almost irrelevant (which makes it no less despicable). What is relevant is the following question: If the NFL would pay nearly $1 billion to compensate former players for their brain injuries, which occurred while playing football, why would any parent voluntarily allow their son or daughter to play football?

Playing football leads to brain damage. Permanent, devastating brain damage. The numbers are in; <a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/Neurology/HeadTrauma/44760">the science is clear</a>. Every single player at every single age is at risk.

And that includes your child.
<h2>Why your child is at-risk of developing CTE from playing sports</h2>
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy used to be called &#x201C;punch drunk,&#x201D; because the condition was observed so frequently in boxers. It was not until the last decade that it became apparent football causes CTE due to the repetitive blows to the head.&#xA0; It occurs when a person takes repeated blows to the head, over a certain period of time, even when they do not result in a concussion. While not every football player will develop CTE, it is now clear the overwhelming majority of players will. This is due to &#xA0;repeated trauma causing a build-up of a protein called tau. Tau normally makes sure that the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/31/tau-protein-not-plaque-may-cause-alzheimers-study-says/">nerves in your brain</a> are operating smoothly, but after football related blows to the head, it twists and collapses into what doctors call &#x201C;tangles.&#x201D; These tangles directly lead to irreversible brain damage.

This is the worst part: according to Boston University, &#x201C;these changes in the brain can begin months, years, or even decades <strong>after the last brain trauma or end of active athletic involvement</strong>&#x201D; (emphasis ours). That means that one season of middle school football can cause your child to suffer a debilitating, degenerative brain disease that could lead to dementia, violent tendencies and even suicide.

Imagine what four years of high school football can cause. Imagine what 15 years of professional football in the NFL leads to.
<h2>Choose life</h2>
The underlying problem with all of this doesn&#x2019;t only lie with Goodell and the NFL: it lies with every single person who watches the games, who buys the merchandise, who lets their children play a game that may one day cause them to <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/01/sport/football/nfl-chiefs-shooting/">kill their families and then themselves</a>. It&#x2019;s about choosing a life where your child has an <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/concussion-watch/76-of-79-deceased-nfl-players-found-to-have-brain-disease/">80% chance of developing CTE</a>. It&#x2019;s about not examining the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/study-cte-linked-domestic-violence-article-1.1978936">causes of domestic violence</a> that plague American football players.

Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy is real. It is linked to football. It is killing our kids. And until we, as parents and community members, decide to stand up and say &#x201C;No more!&#x201D; it will continue to do so.

It&#x2019;s time to stop choosing football. Choose the future. Choose your children. Choose life.

The comedian was critically injured and lost his close friend, 62-year-old comedian James McNair. Three other passengers were badly hurt in the accident.

Christopher Hart, Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, informed those <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/250857-ntsb-tracy-morgan-crash-caused-by-speed-driver-fatigue">attending the hearing</a> that the &#x201C;driver in the Cranbury crash had been on duty for 13&#xBD; hours of a 14-hour day, with more driving planned. <strong>He had been awake more than 28 hours </strong>when his truck struck the limo van, including an overnight drive from his residence in Georgia to the distribution center at which he was based&#x201D; (emphasis hours).

Hart&#x2019;s detailing of the NTSB&#x2019;s findings highlights national issues with big rigs on the road. The accident occurred while Congress was debating changes to federal regulations for truck-driver scheduling. Currently, drivers must take a 30 minute break for every 8 hours of driving, are not supposed to drive more than 10 hours in an 11 hour work-day, and have a maximum work week of 70 hours, after which they must take a 34-hour break before continuing a job or starting a new one. With the conclusion of the NTSB&#x2019;s investigation, more voices than ever are calling for national reform and Congress has paused its look into loosening restrictions like these.

The AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/251275-unions-tracy-morgan-crash-findings-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-feds">has spoken out</a>, claiming that the high-profile accident should be a &#x201C;wake-up&#x201D; for federal regulators. Ed Wytkind, President of the AFL-CIO TTD, went so far as to describe the situation as a &#x201C;driver fatigue crisis&#x201D; in a blog post.

In this case, the driver of the truck was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto. Tracy Morgan settled with Walmart earlier this year for an undisclosed amount, but the wounds he suffered and the attention this case has garnered will hopefully leave a more lasting mark. Until federal regulations prevent this sort of accident from happening, if injured, you may need help recovering from the companies that operate these too often dangerous vehicles.

Mike Fuller has filed a complaint against Southwestern Illinois Health Facilities, Inc. doing business as Anderson Hospital Urgent Care. The <a href="http://madisonrecord.com/stories/510633888-anderson-hospital-doctors-deny-liability-in-patient-s-medical-malpractice-suit-over-stroke">complaint alleges</a> that due to the facilities&#x2019; negligence, Fuller suffered a stroke that left him unable to move his limbs, accrued staggering medical expenses, and caused him pain and suffering.

According to the complaint, agents of the company allegedly failed to examine Fuller&#x2019;s carotid arteries and failed to order imaging for a &#x201C;diabetic, hypertensive, former smoker who was later documented to have significant coronary artery disease.&#x201D;

When cases like this come along, there are significant factors to consider. Fuller&#x2019;s past behavior and history certainly should have been indicative of a potential problem, but Southwestern Illinois Health Facilities has the resources to argue any motion and counter any case that Fuller can argue.
<h2>Know the risk factors</h2>
Strokes are the number 4 killer of <a href="http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@adv/documents/downloadable/ucm_307206.pdf">people in Ohio,</a> and the number 5 killer of <a href="http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@adv/documents/downloadable/ucm_307175.pdf">people in Kentucky</a>. Any of the following lifestyle factors automatically put you in a higher risk category of suffering a stroke; smoking, high blood pressure, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, high cholesterol, poor weight management, or drug use. If you have any of these lifestyle factors, you should know the signs and symptoms of stroke. The faster you are treated for a stroke, the better your chances of a full recovery. The <a href="http://yourdiseaserisk.wustl.edu/YDRDefault.aspx?ScreenControl=YDRGeneral&amp;ScreenName=YDRStrokeFact_Sheet#q5">symptoms of a stroke</a> include:
<ul>
    <li>Sudden weakness or numbness, especially in one side of your body</li>
    <li>Sudden loss of vision or problems seeing</li>
    <li>Sudden confusion, inability to speak or understand others</li>
    <li>Sudden dizziness and lack of coordination</li>
    <li>Sudden severe headache</li>
</ul>
Failure to diagnose cases are rarely a straightforward. In the case of a stroke, the waters may be even muddier. Strokes are preventable, mostly through healthy living, and they are treatable within a reasonable time frame. While there is no guaranteed test of who will or will not suffer a stroke, there are certain indicators that a patient may be in a high-risk category. Failure to monitor people exhibiting those risks may increase their chances of having a stroke, and could be construed as medical malpractice depending on the circumstances.

If you or someone you know has suffered a stroke while under medical care, our experienced medical malpractice attorneys are here to help. Our skilled legal staff and registered nurses work together for you.

For adults with Type 2 diabetes, there is a range of drug regimens available to control the condition. However, two drugs have recently been linked to acute pancreatitis leading to precancerous changes and an increased risk of heart failure.

Onglyza or Kombiglyze XR both belong to a class of Type 2 diabetes medications called incretin mimetics. Both contain the active ingredient saxagliptin, and work by increasing the amount of incretin released by the intestine. Incretin plays an important role in regulating the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreas.
<h2>Type 2 diabetics taking these drugs are at risk</h2>
According to the Food and Drug Administration, there have been reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking Onglyza. Saxagliptin should not be prescribed to people who have a history of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) because it is not known whether the medication can increase the risk for the disease.

In 2014, the FDA issued a safety alert after a study found that Onglyza was responsible for a 27% increase in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. The drug is still available for sale, and is still being prescribed despite the known risks.

Your doctor should be aware of your family history, and should not prescribe either of these drugs if you have any risk factors for pancreatitis or a heart condition. However, some doctors may not be aware of the adverse side effects of these drugs. If you are taking Onglyza or Kombiglyze XR for Type 2 diabetes, you should discuss alternative treatment options with your doctor.

If you or someone you know is currently taking or has taken Onglyza or Kombiglyze XR for Type 2 diabetes, you should have a full physical examination as soon as possible and talk to your doctor about alternative treatments.

You may be entitled to compensation if you have suffered any injuries or damages while taking these medications. Our experienced medical malpractice and defective medical device attorneys can get you the compensation you deserve.

The General Motors ignition switch debacle has been splashed across the news in varying degrees for years. The Department of Justice has recently ended the controversy with decisive action, and it looks like the story is just going to go away. News media&#x2019;s coverage of the agreement has been perfunctory at best.

We submit that the Department of Justice handled the GM ignition switch scandal astoundingly badly. As a condition of the final settlement, there will be no criminal charges. General Motors was fined less than $1 billion, significantly less than Toyota received several years ago for their sticking accelerator issue.
<h2>Why everyone should be outraged</h2>
The deaths were the result of a decade long cover-up, perpetuated by the company&#x2019;s intentional conduct to hide the issue. This type of gross corporate negligence is inexcusable, and the Department of Justice essentially punished GM with a slap on the wrist.

The DOJ agreed to defer prosecution in the case, placing the company on a three-year probation. The charges, by the way, would have been for failure to disclose a defect. Not for intentional conduct, not for killing people &#x2013; but for failing to report a problem. The DOJ said that GM&#x2019;s executives were extraordinarily cooperative after the issue was uncovered. Tell that to the families of those killed by their mistake.

No indictments, no criminal charges: no one will be punished for directly causing the deaths of 124 people. No one will suffer financially with the possible exception of GM&#x2019;s stockholders. The DOJ managed to shove a little more money into the government&#x2019;s coffers, and in doing so, passed on the message that killing people with your products, while frowned upon, is ultimately forgivable if you apologize.
<h2>Protecting the people once again</h2>
GM&#x2019;s ignition switch recall was an outrage, and constituted negligence in the highest degree. The company lied about the scope and scale of the issue and lied about the number of people affected. They attempted to save face by downplaying an issue that cost 124 people their lives. The number of deaths, by the way, was not freely submitted by GM but was instead uncovered by plaintiff&#x2019;s lawyers diligently working to correct a life-threatening wrong.

The difference between a good resolution to this abhorrent situation and the resolution that we got is very simple. The difference is about 5 plaintiff&#x2019;s lawyers that could have represented the friends and families of those who were killed by GM&#x2019;s gross negligence. Those lawyers would have ensured that the message hit home for GM &#x2013; that people suffered on their watch because of their mistakes. General Motors and the Department of Justice should be ashamed.

The power of an experienced plaintiff personal injury attorney cannot be denied. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our personal injury lawyers help people, like the victims of the GM defect, every single day.

New research from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University has found that &#x201C;87 of 91 deceased NFL players tested were found to have evidence of the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.&#x201D; The study found that the prevalence of the disease is overwhelming; &#xA0;96% of former players had evidence of CTE, and 79% of <em>all players at all levels</em> showed signs.

And yes, that includes your high school age children.
<h2>All players AT ALL LEVELS show signs of CTE</h2>
One more time; all players, at all levels. PBS reports that &#x201C;CTE [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][was found] in the brain tissue in 131 out of 165 individuals who, before their deaths, played football either professionally, semi-professionally, in college <strong>or in high school</strong>&#x201D; (emphasis ours). That does not mean that your child is merely at an increased risk of possibly developing the disease. It means that your child is virtually guaranteed to develop symptoms of CTE if he or she plays football.
<h2>What is CTE?</h2>
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy was technically <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/league-of-denial/the-four-stages-of-cte/">discovered in 2002</a>, in the brain of a former football player named Mike Webster. Before that, it was called &#x201C;punch drunk,&#x201D; a term reserved almost exclusively for boxers. Thus, we always *knew* about CTE; we just did not have an official name for it.

There are four stages to the disease:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stage One. </strong>The protein tau builds up in unconnected parts of the brain, usually around the frontal lobe or the crown. Tau can lead to irreversible brain damage by &#x201C;interrupting normal functioning and eventually killing nerve cells,&#x201D; according to Frontline.</li>
    <li><strong>Stage Two.</strong> As the tau affects more brain cells, you can observe changes in behavior of the afflicted person. Depression, rage and poor impulse control are common.</li>
    <li><strong>Stage Three.</strong> The tau has expanded into the temporal lobe, and begins to affect the hippocampus and amygdala. Confusion is a common result; memory loss another.</li>
    <li><strong>Stage Four.</strong> Frontline puts it best: &#x201C;The brain becomes deformed and brittle, and cognitive function is severely limited. By Stage 4 tau deposits have overwhelmed the brain, killing many nerve cells and shrinking it by roughly half its size.&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
This is what will happen to your children when you let them play football.
<h2>Playing with fire</h2>
If you still believe that your child will beat the odds, consider these numbers from the <a href="http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx">National Safety Council</a>:
<ul>
    <li>Chance of dying from heart disease, the Number 1 killer in America: 1 in 7</li>
    <li>Chance of dying in a car crash: 1 in 112</li>
    <li>Chance of dying from a fall: 1 in 144</li>
</ul>
Chance of a football player developing CTE: <strong>96 out of 100.</strong>

There is one more piece of crucial information that you, as parents of high school football players, need to know: CTE cannot necessarily be diagnosed in living players. Your high school football player is likely to already have some evidence of CTE, and there is the distinct possibility that <strong>no doctor will be able to diagnose it.</strong> This has nothing to do with the quality of your doctor or the facility in which he or she works, and everything to do with the test itself. It is only possible to reach a definitive conclusion after a player has died &#x2013; and by then, it is too late.

This is a real disease affecting thousands of men and women around the country. We cannot change the past, but as parents we can take steps towards securing a better future. That starts with putting an end to high school football by refusing to let our children play. As parents, it is our duty to protect our kids as best we can by making the hard decisions for them when they cannot make those decisions themselves.

Choose the future. Choose your children. Choose life.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]

BODY:
On September 26, 2015, the American Museum of Tort Law (the first and only museum of its kind) opened its doors in Winsted, Connecticut &#x2013; the hometown of the museum&#x2019;s creator and founder, Ralph Nader. It is not your typical museum; instead of interactive art or history exhibits, you can see the 1963 Chevrolet Corvair that led Mr. Nader to write <em>Unsafe at Any Speed</em>, the book that helped Americans see that they deserved to be treated with respect and dignity &#x2013; and that defective product manufacturers needed to be held accountable &#x2013; when they suffered a serious personal injury.

It seems almost serendipitous that Mr. Nader&#x2019;s museum opened only a week or so after the GM recall debacle, because it once again underlines the importance of having dedicated counsel on the side of injured consumers. Car safety, factory safety, medical safety, air quality control, the dangers of football: these issues, which so many people scoffed at when they first arose, have been challenged and addressed because of the work of Plaintiffs&#x2019; Bars and attorneys all over the country.
<h2>&#x201C;The cruelest movement I&#x2019;ve ever encountered&#x201D;</h2>
At the heart of the museum lies the ever-changing debate regarding tort reform. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/us/ralph-naders-tort-law-museum-seeks-to-keep-his-crusade-evergreen.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share">The New York Times</a> quotes Mr. Nader as saying that &#x201C;&#x2019;Tort law is being run into the ground, maligned, caricatured and slandered because it&#x2019;s effective,&#x2019;&#x201D; and that the &#x201C;conservative agenda of tort reform, which seeks limits on lawsuits and financial awards, [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][is] &#x2018;the cruelest movement I&#x2019;ve ever encountered.&#x2019;&#x201D;

This new museum could help to counter the push for tort reform throughout the country, by reminding people about the good done by personal injury lawyers and consumer protection agencies. Some of the exhibits on display examine:
<ul>
    <li>The history of the Ford Pinto&#x2019;s problems with exploding gar tanks</li>
    <li>The Dalkan shield, an unsafe IUD that was linked to pelvic inflammatory disease and harmed more than 200,000 American women</li>
    <li>The Stella Liebeck case, where a woman suffered second and third degree burns from a cup of McDonald&#x2019;s coffee</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20150926/ralph-naders-american-museum-of-tort-law-opens-in-winsted">Big Tobacco&#x2019;s fall from power,</a> as the New Haven Register describes it</li>
    <li>The infamous &#x201C;<a href="http://abnormaluse.com/2012/06/the-flaming-rat-case-a-revisonist-analysis.html">Flaming Rats</a>&#x201D; case, which forced manufacturers and facilities owners to take responsibility for their own shoddy training, and to be held liable for the injuries their workers sustained when that training was not in place</li>
</ul>
In the end, the American Museum of Tort Law offers a fascinating look into what it takes to make the world a better and safer place for our families. While the museum may look like a &#x201C;greatest hits&#x201D; collection for Ralph Nader, it explore so much more than just his contributions. And it reminds us that those contributions can sometimes take years and years of persistence, rejection and dedication before they come to fruition.

As personal injury attorneys, we fight many of the same battles that Ralph Nader fights, albeit on smaller scales. The legal communities we join allow us to work together to fight on a larger scale. Everything we do, we do to help our clients have better futures &#x2013; and to make it less likely that future generations will have to fight the same battles over and over again. So if you happen to be in Connecticut (or are a student, practitioner or passionate follower of the justice system), consider making the American Museum of Tort Law one of your stops. We bet it will be a fascinating day.

In July of this year, Wave 3 news reported (in an understated way) that a Jeffersontown, Kentucky nursing home had lost its certification to care for Medicare and Medicaid patients. According to <a href="http://www.wave3.com/story/29521475/report-finds-deficiencies-at-nursing-home-medicare-medicaid-patients-to-be-moved">Wave 3</a>, &#x201C;In late May, the CHFS Office of Inspector General completed several investigations that were begun after receiving complaints about Hurstbourne Care Centre at Stony Brook, located at 2200 Stony Brook Drive. CHFS cited Hurstbourne Care Centre for numerous violations of state and federal laws that regulate the health and safety standards for care by nursing homes.&#x201D;

The investigations resulted in Medicare and Medicaid patients being relocated to other, approved facilities. Upon closer inspection, however, one realizes that the reasons for the loss of certification were quite horrific. The report by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services include deficiencies like:
<ul>
    <li>A resident interview revealed that ants were in the resident&#x2019;s bed and crawling all over the resident&#x2019;s body. The resident was scared and screamed for help from the staff.</li>
    <li>A resident was found on the floor, and no physician was notified. According to records, there was no evidence that precautions were taken against another fall. An x-ray taken 16 hours later showed a broken right tibia.</li>
    <li>A resident was not weighed weekly in direct violation of a physician&#x2019;s order. The resident lost 9.4% of total body weight in a month. Records showed that caloric intake was not properly monitored during that time.</li>
    <li>Residents were observed smoking on the grounds while unsupervised, indicating a failure to ensure a plan of care.</li>
    <li>A resident suffered an eye injury that remained untreated and unexamined for 30 days after the injury occurred.</li>
</ul>
The scope of negligence on behalf of this facility is overwhelming. What is more shocking, perhaps, is that the after an investigation by Kentucky officials, the facility was not shut down. Losing Medicare and Medicaid approval may ultimately prove devastating to the facility, but how much more damage will they be allowed to do before the business fails?

The regulatory system for nursing homes is obviously not working properly. That this level of neglect and abuse is even possible is downright horrifying. Elder abuse is very real, and when it occurs on an institutional level it is absolutely unforgivable.

If your loved one is in a nursing home or long-term care facility, you have placed faith in a facility and its&#x2019; personnel to take care of them. When that faith is betrayed, you and your loved one may be entitled to compensation. Our experienced and compassionate Kentucky nursing home abuse attorneys can help get you the compensation you deserve.

An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is designed to stop a blood clot from traveling to the lungs. It is implanted into the inferior vena cava, the largest vein in the body. The filters are designed and intended to be used in patients who are unable to take blood thinners. IVC filters come in two types; permanent and retrievable.

Patients who experience clotting issues while taking blood thinners are good candidates for permanent implantation, which causes fewer problems. However, retrievable IVC filters are commonly used in situations where blood thinners are ill-advised, such as after accident trauma, bleeding, or surgery.

It is this group that is at the highest risk. The retrievable IVC filters are prone to a host of problems. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a safety alert in 2010, and another in 2014, detailing the types of issues regarding retrievable IVC filters. These include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Device migration.</strong> The filters dislodge from the implantation site and travel through the body. The filter is then unable to perform as indicated and is likely to cause other problems.</li>
    <li><strong>Filter perforation. </strong>The filter stays in place but, due to improper placement or a change in conditions, punctures the side of the vein. This results in internal bleeding and can be fatal.</li>
    <li><strong>Filter fracture.</strong> The filter breaks apart in place, allowing clots to pass through in the heart or lungs, causing potentially fatal embolisms.</li>
    <li><strong>Detached device components. </strong>Parts of the filters break free and circulate through the bloodstream. This can be particularly dangerous because there are now multiple pieces that can puncture different parts of the body, leading to severe internal bleeding, pulmonary embolisms, and death.</li>
</ul>
The FDA is aware of the problem and has issued two major safety communications in regards to the device. The latest report said, &#x201C;The FDA recommends that implanting physicians and clinicians responsible for the ongoing care of patients with retrievable IVC filters consider removing the filter as soon as protection from pulmonary embolism is&#xA0;no longer needed.&#x201D;

If you or a loved one has been implantable with a retrievable IVC filter, you should speak with a medical professional immediately to determine the best way to proceed. If you or someone you know has been injured because of a defective medical device, you may be entitled to compensation. Our experienced defective medical device attorneys in Ohio and Kentucky can help you through a confusing and painful time. <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> today for a free consultation.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3390" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/High-School-Football-Injuries-300x200.jpg" alt="High School Football and Head Injuries" width="300" height="200">It would have seemed impossible, extraordinary, even unfathomable a few years ago &#x2013; but the exodus has begun, and it is starting with Maplewood Richmond Heights High School in Missouri. This year&#x2019;s homecoming game will be a game of soccer, because in June the school board voted to disband their football team &#x2013; a football team that had gone to the state championship only 5 years ago. Lest you think this was the decision of only the Board, know this: the decision to ultimately disband the team came in large part from the very players themselves.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/sports/football/As-Worries-Rise-and-Players-Flee-a-Missouri-School-Board-Cuts-Football.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share">The New York Times</a> cites Nelson Mitten, &#x201C;the school board president, [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][who] said that the series of injuries [sustained by the school&#x2019;s team] last season led the board to discuss disbanding the team. The students were polled about their interests, and just 15 said they would try out for the team this season, including only five returning players.&#x201D;

&#x201C;When you simply don&#x2019;t have the players, it&#x2019;s obvious,&#x201D; the school board president explained. &#x201C;I had two parents informally raise concerns, but this was more of a student-participation-driven decision. It withered.&#x201D;

And these players are not alone.
<h2>Taking steps around the country</h2>
Other schools around the country have seen interest wane, leading them to disband their teams. Ridgefield Memorial High School in New Jersey only had 13 students show up for varsity tryouts. Camden Hills Regional High School in Maine had to cancel games because of the sheer number of injuries their experienced players sustained, and they believed their younger player were at risk. All in all, &#x201C;the number of male high school football players has fallen to about&#xA0;<a href="http://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatics/PDF/2014-15_Participation_Survey_Results.pdf">1.08 million this year</a>, a 2.4 percent decline from&#xA0;five years ago.&#x201D;

Even the mighty Pop Warner organization is feeling the squeeze, as its numbers fall each year. It is currently being sued by a parent whose 25 year old son committed suicide; brain scans showed that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.
<h2>A call to action for parents and school boards alike</h2>
It is time for us to stop thinking about &#x201C;tradition&#x201D; and to listen to our children, who are making their stances known. Decreasing numbers of participants and increasing numbers of injuries &#x2013; football is hurting our children. It has led to the deaths of three students this season alone, and the year has only just begun. How many more children have to die before we all, as a collective group, put an end to this horrific game?

The doctors have spoken. Your children have spoken. It is time to put an end to high school football once and for all.

Choose the future. Choose your children. Choose life.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]

Recent research published in the <em>Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation </em>has shown that direct brain control can be used to control the legs after a spinal cord injury. For the first time in this case, scientists are attempting to allow direct brain control of the muscles involved. Scientists in this case used a combination of an electroencephalogram (EEG) system and direct muscle stimulation with electrodes.

The study&#x2019;s participant has been paralyzed for five years as the result of injury. He is categorized as a paraplegic, and does not have sensation in or the use of his legs. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150923213931.htm">Science Daily</a> said that in preparation for the experiment, &#x201C;Mental training was initially needed to reactivate the brain&apos;s walking ability. Seated and wearing an EEG cap to read his brainwaves, the participant trained to control an avatar in a virtual reality environment. He also required physical training to recondition and strengthen his leg muscles.&#x201D;

After almost 20 weeks of intensive training, he was able to walk a 12-foot long course with the aid of a body support system. This experiment serves as a proof-of-concept for the neurological community. In time, the researchers hope to use brain implants and implanted electrodes to develop a more seamless version of this technology.

Lead researcher Dr. Zoran Nenadic said, &#x201C;We hope that... implant[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][s] could achieve an even greater level of prosthesis control because brain waves are recorded with higher quality. In addition, such an implant could deliver sensation back to the brain, enabling the user to feel their legs.&#x201D;

This experiment is a rare treat for us. We so often bring news of risks and dangers that have lifelong impacts; in this case, we get to tell you that there is hope on the horizon for victims of spinal cord trauma.

However, a full solution may be many years down the road. In the meantime, medical bills and lifestyle changes require compensation. Until we get to the point where simple surgery can repair life-altering injuries, experienced personal injury attorneys are necessary to help you get the compensation you deserve. If you or someone you know has suffered a traumatic injury with life-altering consequences, we are here to fight for your rights.

In 2011, Rita Vasquez underwent cervical spine surgery at Our Lady of the Resurrection Medical Center in Chicago. The surgery was intended to relieve the severe pain that she was suffering as a result of a compressed disc. Instead, Vasquez sustained serious injuries including vascular injury, hemorrhage, nerve injury, and continued bodily pain.

Vazquez filed suit this past September against her surgeon, Dr. Michel Malek, alleging negligence. According to the <a href="http://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/510640533-patient-sues-doctor-alleging-medical-malpractice-in-cervical-spine-surgery">Cook County Record</a>, &#x201C;The suit says Malek failed to protect vasculature and neurological structures at the time of the surgery from damage and excessive bleeding.&#x201D; Vazquez is seeking compensation for her emotional distress, pain and suffering, and lost time and wages.
<h2>What is cervical spine surgery?</h2>
Cervical, in this case, refers to the part of the spine from the base of the brain to the bottom of the neck. Surgery on this area is complex; there are many important structures to navigate, from blood vessels and nerve endings to the esophagus and trachea.

The most common form of cervical spine surgery is called Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion (ACDF). The procedure is intended to eliminate root nerve pain that can translate into pain and weakness in other parts of the body. During the procedure, surgeons must navigate a complicated maze of vessels and organs. The esophagus, and by extension the trachea, must be moved out of the way to allow unimpeded access to the cervical vertebrae. Several layers of tissue must be cut or removed to allow access to the spine. Finally, tools must be inserted through all of these layers to allow surgeons to grind bone spurs and screw plates on to your spine.

This kind of surgery is invasive and carries a high risk of complications. The primary complication of ACDF is dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing. Sometimes, the degree of dysphagia is so high that a feeding tube is required. Occasionally, dysphagia is present before surgery as a result of a herniated disc. In these cases, it can be exacerbated during surgery and require a feeding tube for months after the operation.

The benefits of the surgery (i.e., relief from chronic pain) often outweigh the risks, but no one should be made to suffer unintended consequences of surgery. If you or someone you know has undergone ACDF surgery and suffered complications, you may be entitled to compensation.

A chilling <a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=21794">report</a> from the Institute of Medicine in Washington, DC says that most people will suffer at least one wrong medical diagnosis in their life. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/arleneweintraub/2015/09/22/report-doctors-are-screwing-up-diagnoses-and-patients-should-speak-out/">Forbes</a> magazine summarized the report, in which authors found, &#x201C;...5% of American adults who receive outpatient care every year are victims of erroneous diagnoses. Such errors are responsible for up to 17% of adverse events in hospitals and 10% of patient deaths. And diagnostic mistakes comprise the most common types of paid medical malpractice claims.&#x201D;
<h2>IOM Report says patients can help fix the problem</h2>
The solution, the report recommends, is to get patients more involved in their own medical care. However, doctors are trained professionals; their sole job is to diagnose and prevent harm. Car companies do not ask customers to tinker around under the hood. In fact, aside from basic maintenance, you are encouraged to let professionals diagnose and solve any problem.

So why is the healthcare system different? According to Michael Cohen, professor of pathology at the University of Utah School of Medicine and member of the committee that published the recent report, &#x201C;Making a diagnosis is a complex problem. To improve the whole process we need to be better integrated in terms of how we address patients&#x2019; problems. Teamwork across disciplines is really critical.&#x201D;

Cohen&#x2019;s comment points to a larger problem; medical technology is not being utilized to its&#x2019; fullest potential. Electronic health records are largely aimed at compliance. The report states that most EHRs are &#x201C;...aimed at meeting billing and legal requirements.&#x201D; Because these records are not being used to increase clarity between doctors, laboratory technicians, and specialists, they create a failure point as opposed to strengthening the system.

The long and short of it is that this report encourages patients to be more involved in their own care. This is not a bad concept, but the healthcare system is not currently designed to encourage patient input. Often times, patient intervention is considered an annoyance at best.

While there is no doubt that being more involved in your own healthcare can only benefit you, your lack of questioning is not an excuse for a misdiagnosis. When you or a loved one is sick, you may not have the emotional strength or the presence of mind to ask insightful questions.

In this situation, having an experienced medical malpractice attorney on your side could save your life. If you or someone you know has suffered a misdiagnosis, please <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> today for a free consultation at one of our Ohio or Kentucky offices.

Veteran Wade Ayer lost his sister in 2003 to medical malpractice, and has taken up the cause of medical malpractice victims everywhere. He proposed an idea to Wisconsin State Rep. Christine Sinicki, who authored Assembly Bill 255, variously known as the &#x201C;Julie Ayer Rubenzer Law&#x201D; or the &#x201C;Surgical Black Box Bill.&#x201D;

The idea is simple. According to <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/255533-black-box-to-combat-medical-malpractice">The Hill</a>, the Surgical Black Box Bill would give &#x201C;the patient consumer the right to choose to have their surgery recorded by audio and video. All data can be used in a court of law.&#xA0; It is designed for disciplinary boards to review and weed out bad doctors. It is also to protect whistleblowers and good doctors.&#x201D;

Ayer has faced many obstacles to his idea, not least of which is a lack of response from several senators and representatives. He, and we, believe that this bill and the resultant conversations need to be addressed.
<h2>Can a black box really help?</h2>
Surgical malpractice is a large and serious problem. According to researchers at <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/johns_hopkins_malpractice_study_surgical_never_events_occur_at_least_4000_times_per_year">Johns Hopkins</a>, &#x201C;a surgeon in the United States leaves a foreign object such as a sponge or a towel inside a patient&#x2019;s body after an operation 39 times a week, performs the wrong procedure on a patient 20 times a week and operates on the wrong body site 20 times a week.&#x201D;

These are preventable problems. A surgical black box would benefit everyone, from surgeons in training to insurers and, most importantly, to patients and victims of medical malpractice. In a technologically advanced society, we can review a football play from nearly any angle; why can&#x2019;t we do the same when a person&#x2019;s life is on the line?

Study leader Dr. Marty Makary, an associate professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said &#x201C;There are mistakes in health care that are not preventable. Infection rates will likely never get down to zero even if everyone does everything right... But the events we&#x2019;ve estimated are totally preventable. This study highlights that we are nowhere near where we should be and there&#x2019;s a lot of work to be done.&#x201D;

This bill could change all of that. Until it does, surgical malpractice will continue to be a common and devastating issue. If you are a victim of medical malpractice, our experienced and compassionate medical malpractice attorneys in Ohio and Kentucky can help get you the compensation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> today for a free consultation.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2657" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Brain-Injury-300x225.jpg" alt="Brain Injury Attorneys in Ohio and Kentucky" width="300" height="225">Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is making headlines across the country. Sports pages are full of wins and losses and player statistics, but they are not reporting on the devastating effects of this disease on those players and their families. Active research is providing hope for CTE sufferers, but we at Crandall &amp; Pera Law believe the cause needs greater attention.
<h2>What is CTE?</h2>
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a brain disease, like Alzheimer&#x2019;s and Parkinson&#x2019;s. The problem with these types of brain diseases is that they are undetectable until the symptoms progress to a point where daily function is impaired. At this point, doctors can make a best guess diagnosis, but Alzheimer&#x2019;s and CTE can only be confirmed by a brain biopsy after death.

CTE is caused by repeated traumas to the brain. Minor impacts over time contribute to a gradual and increasing degeneration of brain tissue. The degeneration is accompanied by a build up of a protein called &#x201C;tau.&#x201D; Tau proteins exist in the brain to stabilize the connections between neurons; in a person with CTE, tau proteins are &#x201C;tangled&#x201D; and no longer able to stabilize the connections. In response, the body produces more protein to &#x201C;fix&#x201D; the damage. CTE is thus evidenced by a high level of tau protein in brain fluid.
<h2>How research is helping</h2>
<a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/skin-test-identifies-more-tau-protein-alzheimers-and-parkinsons-patients-possible-323434">Medical Daily</a> reports that researchers are exploiting the fact that human brain tissue and skin tissue originate from the same type of tissue in developing embryos. With this knowledge, Dr. Ildefonso Rodriguez-Leyva of Central Hospital in Mexico put a team together to develop a skin test for tau protein levels.

The research was aimed at developing a single test to identify Alzheimer&#x2019;s and Parkinson&#x2019;s, but the results could have implications for CTE sufferers as well. The study found that those suffering neurodegenerative disorders had tau protein levels as much as &#x201C;...7 times higher than healthy participants.&#x201D; &#xA0;This is exciting news, as a conclusive test would enable doctors to start treatment earlier, potentially averting the more devastating effects of these degenerative diseases.

Study author Dr. Rodriguez-Leyva said in a press release, &#x201C;More research is needed to confirm these results, but the findings are exciting because we could potentially begin to use skin biopsies from living patients to study and learn more about these diseases... This procedure could be used to study not only Alzheimer&#x2019;s and Parkinson&#x2019;s, but also other neurodegenerative diseases.&#x201D;

In the meantime, researchers around the world are continuing the effort to understand and cure neurodegenerative disorders. The CTE Center at Boston University continuously examines the efficacy of treatment protocols, and offers the general public opportunities to <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cte/our-research/">volunteer</a> their time or money to benefit the sufferers of CTE.

Research is progressing in a number of exciting ways, but the only thing we know for certain is that CTE is real and that the proximate cause is repeated trauma. The only way to avoid the condition is to prevent the circumstances that cause it. Contact sports, like football, are proven to result in CTE 96% of the time. It is a virtual guarantee that players will be affected to a greater or lesser degree.

Parents should consider the potential risks involved when deciding whether to allow their children to participate in contact sports that put their child at high risk of developing CTE later in life. &#xA0;&#xA0;There is nothing wrong with saying &#x201C;no&#x201D; when the future health of your child&#x2019;s brain is at stake.

Choose the future. Choose your children.

This failure to adhere to proper infection control practices put every single one of those employees at needless risk.

While errors of this magnitude are rare, they are not unheard of. The nurse has been reported to the state Board of Nursing, and will likely face stiff penalties, up to and including the revocation of her license. However, even when best practices are observed, you are still at risk.
<h2>Proper procedures can still make you sick</h2>
A study published in early October in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) <em>Internal Medicine</em> found that even when healthcare providers changed protective gloves and gowns, both they and their patients were still at risk of contamination.

According to <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hospital-workers-often-transfer-germs-when-removing-gloves-gowns/">Scientific American</a>, &#x201C;the participants put on protective gowns and gloves in their usual manner and then had a small amount of fluorescent lotion placed in the palm of their hands, which they then rubbed between their hands for 15 seconds to simulate dirtied gloves, then smeared the gloves over the chest and abdomen area of the gown. Then the gloves were exchanged for clean ones.&#x201D;

Researchers examined the participants with a black light after a change of gloves and gowns. The results were astounding; the participants&#x2019; skin and clothing were contaminated 46% of the time. When proper procedures were followed, contamination occurred 30% of the time, as opposed to 70% when best practices were not observed.

Dr. Curtis J. Donskey of the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center said, &#x201C;Most of the participants appeared to be unaware of the high risk for contamination and many reported receiving minimal or no training in putting on and taking off personal protective equipment.&#x201D;

This study hopes to use the fluorescent dye technique to implement training procedures to reduce contamination of and by healthcare professionals. In the meantime, approximately 1 in 25 hospital patients contract a healthcare-associated infection (HAI) <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/surveillance/index.html">every day</a>. Until better training procedures are established, you and your loved ones are at risk.

If you or someone you know has contracted a healthcare-associated infection, you may be entitled to compensation.

The study is the largest ever of its kind, evaluating the outcome of early labor induction in 822 pregnant women with the condition. The results are promising, and bring attention to a little known issue.
<h2>What is fetal macrosomia?</h2>
According to the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fetal-macrosomia/basics/definition/con-20035423">Mayo Clinic</a>, The term fetal macrosomia is used to describe a &#x201C;newborn who&apos;s significantly larger than average. A baby diagnosed with fetal macrosomia has a birth weight of more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams), regardless of his or her gestational age. About 9 percent of babies born worldwide weigh more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces.&#x201D;

Fetal macrosomia is difficult to detect and diagnose during pregnancy, but the condition puts your child at a higher risk of birth injury. In particular, fetal macrosomia is associated with an increased risk of shoulder dystocia and emergency cesarean section. The risks associated can also include:
<ul>
    <li>Significant shoulder dystocia resulting in oxygen deprivation</li>
    <li>Clavicle or long bone fractures</li>
    <li>Brachial plexus injury</li>
    <li>Intracranial hemorrhage</li>
    <li>Death</li>
</ul>
The study found that induced labor mitigated these risk in early term babies. However, as always, the best protection is knowledge. While the causes of fetal macrosomia are imperfectly understood, some factors like obesity or diabetes can place expectant mothers in a higher risk category.

In fact, the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fetal-macrosomia/basics/risk-factors/con-20035423">Mayo Clinic</a> suggests that, &#x201C;Fetal macrosomia is more likely to be a result of maternal diabetes, obesity or weight gain during pregnancy than other causes. If these risk factors aren&apos;t present and fetal macrosomia is suspected, it&apos;s possible that your baby might have a rare medical condition that affects fetal growth.&#x201D;

The health of you and your child is ultimately the responsibility of your healthcare provider. During pregnancy, a team of healthcare professionals working together can help ensure a safe and healthy outcome. However, when conditions are missed or overlooked, you and your baby are placed at unnecessary risk.

If your child suffered birth injuries as a result of fetal macrosomia, you may be the victim of medical malpractice.

The wheel suddenly becomes an enemy. Wrestling for control, your vehicle does not respond the way you anticipate, and just getting to the side of the road can be difficult.

Passenger vehicle tires range from about 20 to 30 inches on average. Big rig tires, on the other hand, can come in at almost four feet high. Larger tires represent significantly more mass, and more mass in a high-speed blowout can have devastating consequences for other drivers on the road.

The blowouts are dangerous because of both speed and force. A blowout represents a tremendous amount of force, and at highway speeds shredded tires become ballistic shrapnel. An episode of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters_(2007_season)#Episode_80_.E2.80.93_.22Big_Rig_Myths.22">MythBusters</a> tested this scenario and found that shrapnel from a big rig tire blowout had enough force to literally decapitate a human being.
<h2>The dangers of retreaded tires</h2>
Tire blowouts on big rigs are more common than you care to think. Trucks travel all over the country, and all those miles mean a tremendous amount of wear on tires. Additionally, most truck tires are not purchased new as a cost-saving measure. Instead, companies use &#x201C;retreads,&#x201D; tires that use old sidewalls and have new tread fused on. Most retreads are considered as safe as new tires. However, a study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found a problem with retreads that is costing lives.

<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-rig-fatal-accidents-linked-driving-trucks-over-75-mph-top-speed/">CBS News said</a>, &#x201C;According to the NHTSA, no truck tire is rated in excess of 81mph and most are rated at 75 mph, but 16 states have trucks speeds equal to or greater than 75 miles per hour; four even go beyond that, to 80mph.&#x201D; At high speeds, retread tires are more likely to fail. This type of blowout directly caused 223 deaths between 2009 and 2013.

Big rigs are worth paying attention to on the road. Try to not to get stuck on the side of a big rig in traffic, and make sure that you can see the driver in his or her mirrors. Unfortunately, even the most cautious drivers can be the victims of circumstance.

The study was published in the journal <em>Anesthesiology</em> after researchers observed 277 procedures at the medical center.

The study is bringing an overlooked aspect of surgery into the spotlight. Previous studies of this nature relied mostly on self-reported information from clinicians as opposed to direct observation. According the lead author, Karen Nanji, medication errors and drug side effects during surgery &#x201C;have really not been studied in any systematic way.&#x201D;
<h2>Why the problem persists</h2>
More than a third of the observed errors caused some kind of patient harm. Harm, in this case, is defined as an adverse reaction that could have devastating implications. Sometimes, vital signs were affected. In other situations, mislabeled or improperly administered drugs elevated the risk of post-operative infection.

Nanji told the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/10/25/hospitals-mess-medications-surgery-lot/MxJK6yX4lMHOG26wqcXwAM/story.html">Boston Globe</a>, that &#x201C;In the operating room, things happen very rapidly, and patients&#x2019; conditions change quickly, so we don&#x2019;t have time to go through that whole process, which can take hours.&#x201D; Furthermore, there are additional safeguards put in place throughout hospitals that cannot be out in place during surgical procedures. For example, when a prescription is issued from the hospital&#x2019;s pharmacy, that medication is double-checked by a nurse before the patient received it. In an operating room, that extra set of eyes may not be possible.

The Food and Drug Administration is <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm143553.htm">actively working</a> to reduce the impact of medication errors, but these efforts may not be enough. Unfortunately, the full scope of the problem is difficult to grasp, as medication errors are reported on a voluntary basis.

Additionally, the efforts of the FDA are primarily focused on improper prescriptions. They concentrate on doctor-patient communication, naming conventions, and bar code technology. However, patients undergoing surgery are generally under anesthesia; they are unaware of what is being administered and how, and cannot speak up if a problem arises.

Ultimately, this is an avoidable problem. Unfortunately, until we know the extent of the issue and its common culprits, it is a difficult problem to solve. There is no such thing as a routine surgery, and a medication error can result in permanent injury or death.

If you or someone you know has experienced complications due to surgery, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help you get the compensation you deserve.

There are many different factors that cause truck accidents, but the majority of accidents are caused by driver error. Mechanical defects can also be a cause or a contributing factor to a commercial truck accident. Given the fact that there are so many different types of commercial trucks that are used under lots of different circumstances, there will be almost countless different types of truck accidents.
<h2>Common types of truck accidents</h2>
There are dozens of different kinds of commercial trucks on the roadways today. Each truck has a different job to do, but what they all have in common is their massive size and their ability to inflict catastrophic harm to smaller, passenger vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians with whom they must share the road. Some of the different types of truck accidents include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Flatbed truck accidents.</strong> Flatbed trucks do not have a compartment, so the loads they carry sit on the flat bed of the truck and must be carefully secured so that the weight of the cargo does not shift and cause the truck to tip and cause an accident.</li>
    <li><strong>Box delivery truck accidents.</strong> Box trucks are commonly used to make package deliveries in neighborhoods and in commercial districts. These tall, wide trucks have blind spots which do not allow the driver to see when another vehicle is trying to overtake them quickly especially on the right side. Box truck drivers who are making local deliveries are up against tight deadlines, so they might drive a bit faster than they should and a bit more aggressively than is safe for the situation, which can cause an accident.</li>
    <li><strong>Trash truck accidents.</strong> Garbage trucks are tall and wide and heavy, which makes them challenging to maneuver on city streets and suburban neighborhoods. They pose a danger to pedestrian and bicyclists because they have blind spots where the driver is unable to see what is coming up from behind them.</li>
    <li><strong>Dump truck accidents.</strong> Dump trucks are another type of big truck that can become unbalanced and tip. A big dump truck can cause a terrible accident if its contents spill, while not suffering much damage to itself at all.</li>
    <li><strong>Cement truck accidents.</strong> The drum on a concrete truck that holds the cement rotates while the truck is in motion. These trucks are huge and unwieldy, and they are a challenge to operate either on city streets or on the highway. When these big trucks end up in an accident they can cause serious injuries and property damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Causes of commercial truck accidents</h2>
Human error or negligence is the cause of most motor vehicle accidents. When the driver is not giving 100 percent of their attention to the task of driving, they can end up causing an accident. Drunk driving, distracted driving, drowsy driving, speeding and lack of training are all forms of negligence on the part of the driver. Mechanical problems, unbalanced loads, defective equipment can be attributed to inadequate maintenance, which is also the driver&apos;s responsibility.

If you have been injured in an accident with a commercial truck whether you were driving a passenger vehicle or you were a pedestrian or cyclist, you may be able to take legal action against the driver and the owner of the commercial vehicle. There are civil remedies available which allow you to recover damages that will compensate you for your losses.

You may contact an experienced commercial truck accident attorney at Crandall &amp; Pera Law, who will discuss your case with you and answer your questions. <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation in Ohio and Kentucky.

Physical and chemical restraints are sometimes used in a nursing home environment in an attempt to control the behavior of residents despite the fact that the <a href="http://www.aarp.org/home-garden/livable-communities/info-2001/the_1987_nursing_home_reform_act.html">Nursing Home Reform Act</a> (NHRA) of 1987 prohibits the use of restraints as a means of controlling behavior or convenience.
<h2>Common forms of chemical and physical restraints used in nursing homes</h2>
A nursing care facility may be understaffed and they are using physical restraints as a convenience in order to control the movement of residents. Patients who suffer from dementia may be difficult to manage, so the nursing home may over medicate them in order to keep them docile enough for the staff to be able to care for their needs. Some examples of physical and chemical restraints include:
<ul>
    <li>Straps, belts, vests</li>
    <li>Wheelchair bars and brakes</li>
    <li>Chairs that tip backwards</li>
    <li>Tucking bed sheets in so tightly that the resident is unable to move</li>
    <li>Locking a resident in their room</li>
    <li>Side rails on a bed (when used to keep an ambulatory patient from getting up on their own)</li>
</ul>
Chemical restraints may include the use of sedatives, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety, anti-depressants and other medications for the purpose of controlling resident&apos;s behavior.
<h2>Risks associated with the use of physical or chemical restraints</h2>
The excessive use of chemical restraints can cause an individual to suffer from over-sedation, confusion, fatigue, dehydration and lack of appetite. The drugs used to chemically restrain the resident might conflict with other medications that the person might be taking. The physical consequences are also quite serious, and may lead to:
<ul>
    <li>Bruises</li>
    <li>Decubitus ulcers</li>
    <li>Urinary incontinence and constipation</li>
    <li>Loss of muscle tone and weakness</li>
    <li>Bone weakness</li>
    <li>Cardiovascular problems</li>
    <li>Depression</li>
    <li>Withdrawal</li>
    <li>Increased agitation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nursing home residents have rights</h2>
Under federal law, nursing home residents are protected by several laws including the specified rights listed in the Residents&#x2019; Rights of Kentucky, which includes the right to be free from restraints, physical or mental abuse, corporal punishment, involuntary seclusion and any physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident&apos;s medical condition. These are all outlined in the Federal Rights of Nursing Facility Residents as well.
<h2>What you can do if your loved one is under unnecessary restraint</h2>
If you are visiting a loved one and you can see that they are being physically restrained by nursing home staff, or they seem unresponsive or over-medicated, you can report what you see to the nursing facility administrators, and you can also report it to the state authority. Even if it is another resident that you see not receiving proper care being restrained or even neglected, you can report the incident and make sure that the situation is addressed immediately.

If you believe that your loved one is being abused or neglected by nursing home staff you may be able to take legal action against the facility on their behalf. Our compassionate nursing home negligence attorneys in Kentucky can help get you the compensation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml">Contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law</a> today for a free consultation.

<strong>Cerebral hypoxia</strong> takes place when the brain (and eventually the entire body) is not getting enough oxygen to stay alive. <strong>Hypoxic brain injury</strong> occurs when there is a decrease in the oxygen supply to the brain. This can be caused by many things such as a head injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, a rapid drop in blood pressure or a heart attack. Brain cells will begin to die if there is not enough oxygen, and after five minutes the person can fall into a coma, experience seizures and the brain will begin to die. The lack of oxygen that causes hypoxia can also be caused by medical mistakes that take place in operating rooms and delivery rooms under emergency conditions.
<h2>Medical causes of hypoxia</h2>
There are several different medical mistakes that can occur in a health care setting that can bring on a state of hypoxia that can lead to brain injuries, including:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Birth-related injuries</strong>. The obstetrician might have failed to perform a Caesarian-section in time, failed to detect that the fetus was in distress, that the umbilical cord was prolapsed, or the baby was in the birth canal for too long. Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is the damage to the cells in the central nervous system caused by lack of oxygen, and it can cause permanent complications.</li>
    <li><strong>Anesthesia errors.</strong> The anesthesiologist might have failed to administer the proper dose of anesthesia, maintain the patient&apos;s blood pressure during surgery, they might not have been aware of the patient&apos;s allergy to a drug, or they could have used a defective ventilator.</li>
    <li><strong>Excessive bleeding</strong>. A surgeon might have nicked a vein or an artery during surgery causing excessive bleeding, which can lead to a drop in blood pressure. This drop in pressure deprives the brain of the oxygen it needs to function and keep the body alive.</li>
    <li><strong>Hypoglycemic encephalopathy.</strong> A patient who falls into a diabetic coma can suffer hypoxia because the brain is not getting an adequate supply of glucose to fuel its function.</li>
    <li><strong>Overmedication.</strong> Some of the sedatives that doctors use act as anesthetics. Given in doses that are too high, and when the airway is not being monitored, these medications can cause the patient can go into respiratory and then cardiac arrest, which can cause brain injury, and eventually death if the patient does not get enough oxygen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms of oxygen deprivation</h2>
When a person is experiencing hypoxia, the symptoms develop in a subtle way. As the brain gets less and less oxygen, the symptoms become more severe. The severity of the brain injury from hypoxia will depend on the length of time the brain was deprived of oxygen. Common symptoms of oxygen deprivation include:
<ul>
    <li>Dizziness</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Headache</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Breathing fast</li>
    <li>Loss of coordination</li>
    <li>Hot and cold flashes</li>
    <li>Cognitive problems</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the long-term consequences of oxygen deprivation?</h2>
If an infant is deprived of oxygen too long during the birth process they can develop cerebral palsy or mental retardation. Health consequences for hypoxia for adults may include:
<ul>
    <li>Neurological impairment</li>
    <li>Depression</li>
    <li>Memory loss</li>
    <li>Decline in executive brain function</li>
    <li>Lack of physical coordination</li>
</ul>
Hypoxia caused by medical malpractice can have far-reaching consequences in the life of the patient. Those who have a child who suffered from oxygen deprivation at birth, or who might have suffered hypoxia during a botched surgery can speak to an experienced medical malpractice attorney at Crandall &amp; Pera Law who will discuss all of the options available.

Power morcellators are produced by various companies, and have been approved for surgical use by the Food and Drug Administration. Several recent lawsuits are raising questions about the known risk associated with power morcellators and the ethics of their use in during surgery.
<h2>What is a power morcellator?</h2>
<img class="alignright wp-image-3696 size-medium" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Power-Morcellator-Approval-Questioned--300x200.jpg" alt="Power Morcellator Approval Questioned " width="300" height="200">A power morcellator is a device used during surgery to cut and shred tissue for removal. The medical device consists of a long, hollow tube with cutting jaws. The jaws slice unwanted tissue during surgery, which is then removed via the hollow tube.

Power morcellators are most often used to remove uterine fibroids, or cysts, during surgery. The problem is that doctors are unable to distinguish cancerous cysts from non-cancerous cysts. If the morcellator cannot remove every single cancerous cell from a cyst, there is potential for that cancer to spread and change.

For example: a Michigan woman recently <a href="http://legalherald.com/michigan-woman-files-power-morcellator-lawsuit/">filed a lawsuit</a> against power morcellator manufacturer Karl Storz Endovision, Inc, after undergoing a laparoscopic hysterectomy, during which power morcellators were used to shred fibroid cysts. The woman was later diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, which her lawsuit alleges is the result of the morcellator use.

Lawsuits such as this raise questions about the medical community&#x2019;s approval of the device. Power morcellators are known to cause upstaging of cancer, turning a treatable Stage 1 ovarian cancer into a terminal Stage 4 cancer affecting other parts of the body. In fact, last year, the FDA issued a warning about the risk of cancer upstaging by power morcellators. In response to this warning, Johnson and Johnson pulled their version of the device from global markets.

It may, however, be a case of too little, too late: &#x201C;Even though the FDA has flagged morcellators&#x2019; risk of spreading undetected cancer, its warning came &#x2018;decades after some studies were already pointing to a serious problem.&#x2019;&#x201D; It appears that action on the issue may come sooner rather than later. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) announced recently that it was beginning an investigation into the FDA&#x2019;s approval of the device.

While Stage 4 cancer is always terminal, uterine fibroids are not. They can cause severe discomfort, but there are many treatments available that do not carry the risk of a power morcellator.

If you or someone you know has undergone surgery with a power morcellator, you should have a comprehensive physical examination as soon as possible. If you have suffered complications due to surgery or cancer upstaging, you may be entitled to compensation for you medical bills and pain and suffering. Our experienced defective medical device attorneys are here to help you. Please contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law today to reserve a consultation with an experienced medical malpractice attorney.

Here are some of the more telling highlights:
<ul>
    <li><strong>6%:</strong> the average return for medical malpractice carriers</li>
    <li><strong>1,000,000:</strong> estimated number of avoidable deaths in relation to medical negligence or malpractice each year, according to a 2011 study by <em>HealthAffairs</em></li>
    <li><strong>$400,000:</strong> the median amount of money awarded by a jury in a medical malpractice lawsuit. (The median is the middle number in a set, or the &#x201C;center&#x201D; number.)</li>
</ul>
What these numbers prove when taken in context is simple: that the only people who fare better because of tort reform are the insurance companies.

Not the doctors in tort-reformed states, who &#x201C;prescribed just as many MRIs and CAT scans as doctors in the control states,&#x201D; thus eliminating the argument that &#x201C;defensive medicine&#x201D; drives up costs, and whose &#x201C;insurance premiums haven&#x2019;t gone down&#x201D; compared to doctors in other states.

Not the taxpayers, who are led to believe they are fronting the costs of &#x201C;frivolous&#x201D; lawsuits (which were never actually filed) with &#x201C;lottery-size sums&#x201D; (which are rarely awarded, and often have more to do with the cost of medical care &#x2013; an area not covered by tort reform).

Certainly not the patients, whose access to justice has been limited by arbitrary rules imposed by legislators who spend more time with insurance company lobbyists than patient advocates &#x2013; or whose recovery has been stifled because of pathetic stall tactics employed by those same insurance companies, thus imposing additional hardships on the victims and their families.
<h2>Denying accountability</h2>
We are given few avenues to truly hold medical professionals accountable for the errors, the insurance companies are desperately trying to take away what vehicles we have left. The Forbes article cites changes in the field of anesthesiology, reporting that:

&#x201C;[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][M]ajor reforms in anesthesiology in the 1980&#x2019;s were the direct result of anesthesiologists&#x2019; frustration with many large malpractice verdicts against the specialty &#x2013; and the attendant negative publicity. In response, anesthesiologists revamped their procedures, established mandatory monitoring, improved training, limited the number of hours anesthesiologists could work without rest, redesigned machines and outfitted others with safety devices. <strong>Within 10 years, the mortality rate from anesthesia dropped from 1 in 6000 administrations to 1 in 200,000.</strong> And anesthesiologists&#x2019; malpractice insurance rates fell to among the lowest of any specialty.&#x201D; (<strong>Emphasis ours</strong>)

Tort reform allows dangerous hospitals and healthcare providers to carry on in the same ways they always have, because their insurance companies have made it virtually impossible to hold them accountable. Tort reform is not about protecting doctors: it is about protecting profits &#x2013; the insurance companies&#x2019; profits. And if we continue to elect legislators who vote for tort reform, we may as well tell victims outright that their pain, suffering and loss do not matter.

Tort reform is dangerous to patients, to victims and to their families. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we always fight on behalf of victims. If you are suffering, we want to be your advocates.

Sonya had had a normal pregnancy; no issues were detected and no problems were anticipated. However, an unfortunate combination of events led to her daughter, Alex, suffering umbilical cord injuries during birth that left her a quadriplegic.

<a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/girl-awarded-further-9m-for-injuries-sustained-during-birth-1.2294058">The case</a> that the family filed against the hospital and the obstetricians who help deliver Alex brought some shocking details to light. Sonya Butler&#x2019;s pre-operative assessment was substandard, and failed to reveal the necessity of C-section. The hospital failed to ensure that a competent obstetrician was present during birth, and a hearing determined that had Alex been born 10-12 minutes earlier, she likely would have suffered no injuries.

The failure of these medical professionals to determine that a C-section was necessary left Alex confined to a wheelchair and requiring a lifetime of medical care. Umbilical cord injuries are serious, and can have devastating consequences.
<h2>What is an umbilical cord injury?</h2>
The umbilical cord is a lifeline between mother and child. It provides blood, oxygen and vital nutrients to an unborn fetus. However, the umbilical cord can become wrapped around a child as it moves in the womb, necessitating surgical intervention to prevent any damage. Problems with the umbilical cord can lead to serious birth injuries, which can affect your child for the rest of his or her life. While problems with the umbilical cord itself are not necessarily a form of medical malpractice, failure to properly monitor the mother and child, and failure to diagnose potential problems as a result of poor monitoring, are indeed forms of medical negligence.

The three most common types of umbilical cord problems include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Umbilical cord prolapse,</strong> when the umbilical cord precedes the infant through the cervix during delivery. This puts the baby at greater risk of becoming entangled in the cord. Prolapse can be the result of premature or breech births or excessive amounts of amniotic fluid.</li>
    <li><strong>Nuchal cord,</strong> which occurs when the umbilical cord is wrapped around the infant&#x2019;s neck. This can lead to oxygen deprivation, known as hypoxia, and the resultant brain damage, known as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE,) that is associated with the compression of the cord during the birthing process often has serious, long lasting effects. Children who suffer HIE can be born with cerebral palsy, or may die as a result. This type of injury was the one that affected the Butler family.</li>
    <li><strong>Umbilical cord knots,</strong> which can result from the natural motions of an infant in amniotic fluid. While knots usually remain loose, there is a higher risk of constriction during delivery. This can restrict the amount of blood and oxygen available to an infant during birth, leading to hypoxia or to HIE.</li>
</ul>
The suffering of the Butler family was entirely preventable. The hospital and doctors had only to exercise a reasonable standard of care to prevent a child from permanent disability.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3750" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/What-Does-&#x201C;Medical-Malpractice&#x201D;-Really-Mean-300x200.jpg" alt="What Does &#x201C;Medical Malpractice&#x201D; Really Mean?" width="300" height="200">In the simplest of terms, medical malpractice occurs when a patient is injured by a medical professional during the course of medical treatment, and that injury was the result of an act of negligence. This is a somewhat over-simplified definition because each state has its own rules about the process for filing the lawsuit, the time limitations and requirements for medical experts.

In order to prove medical negligence you must be able to prove that the act or omission of medical negligence that caused injury or harm deviated from the standard of care or the generally accepted methods or approaches used by doctors in the same specialty to care for patients with a similar condition or under comparable circumstances.

You must be able to prove that the medical professional breached the standard of care in causing your injury. You and your attorney would find a medical expert who would testify and show evidence of how your doctor&apos;s actions or omissions deviated from what another doctor might do in the same situation.
<h2>Was there an injury or harm done?</h2>
In addition to proving the medical mistake or the breach of the acceptable standard of care, you must be able to prove that the medical negligence directly caused the injury or harm.

Here are some basic examples of common mistakes that might lead to a claim of medical malpractice:
<ul>
    <li>Anesthesia errors</li>
    <li>Failure to diagnose a disease</li>
    <li>Failure to monitor a patient after surgery</li>
    <li>Wrong site surgery</li>
    <li>Amputation errors</li>
    <li>Misdiagnosis</li>
    <li>Birth injuries</li>
    <li>Surgical mistakes</li>
    <li>Medication errors</li>
</ul>
<h2>Statutory Rules for medical malpractice cases in Ohio &amp; Kentucky</h2>
Under Ohio law, you must file a medical malpractice lawsuit within one year after the cause of action occurs. You, as the claimant, must give notice to the prospective defendant before you file the actual lawsuit. You will be required to hire the services of an expert to testify with regard to the breach of standard of care, and whether that breach caused an injury. You will also have to provide an affidavit of merit with regard to the facts of the case.

When you prevail in a medical malpractice case, in a jury trial, the jury decides on the amount of damages you will receive for your economic and non-economic losses. <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2323.43">Ohio</a> has placed a cap on non-economic damages for medical malpractice of $250,000 or three times the economic damages with a maximum of $350,000 per plaintiff and $500,000 per occurrence. If the plaintiff has suffered any kind of permanent physical deformity, lost a limb, an organ or has been left with a permanent injury so severe that the person is unable to care for themselves, the maximum amount increase to $500,000 per plaintiff and $1 million per occurrence.

<a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/chapter.aspx?id=39261">Kentucky</a> also has a one year statute of limitations for malpractice. The plaintiff is required to hire an expert to testify as to how the medical professional breached the acceptable standard of care, but there is no requirement for an affidavit of merit in Kentucky. There is also no cap on damages recoverable in medical malpractice lawsuits.

The decision also clarified his April 15 ruling that barred lawsuits for victims that were injured or killed prior to GM&#x2019;s bankruptcy filing in 2009.

The <a href="http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202742135934/With-IgnitionSwitch-Punitives-Possible-GMs-War-Room-Details-Sought?mcode=0&amp;curindex=0&amp;curpage=ALL">National Law Journal</a> reported, &#x201C;In his latest decision, Gerber found that GM could be liable for punitive damages even if its actions involved knowledge of the defect it inherited prior to its bankruptcy&#x2014;such as old documents or employees who stayed with the company.&#x201D;

Finally, a roadmap to justice

In the past, we have written about how poorly the Department of Justice handled the ignition switch recall and how the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration failed to hold GM accountable. With this new decision, it looks like GM may finally face significant financial consequences for the injuries and deaths caused by their defective ignition switch.

The new decision by Gerber is raising further questions about GM&#x2019;s knowledge of the faulty ignition switches. Plaintiffs lawyers have filed a motion to depose a GM employee about a &#x201C;war room&#x201D; that the automaker allegedly created to deal with the consequences from the defect that directly caused 124 deaths and untold numbers of injuries.

Gerber&#x2019;s decision may pave the way for lawyers to conclusively establish that GM had prior knowledge of the ignition switch defect and failed to disclose that information in a timely manner. This issue needs attention; this corporation failed to disclose a problem that killed people, and GM needs to be held properly accountable.

To date, no criminal charges have been filed against any GM employees. The DOJ fined GM, but then deferred prosecution and placed the company on a 3-year probation. This massive corporation got away with a slap on the wrist after knowingly causing the deaths of over 100 people.

In the end, plaintiffs&#x2019; lawyers are the ones who are going to expose the truth. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman found that a deposition about GM&#x2019;s &#x201C;war room&#x201D; could be held in Detroit. Hopefully, because of the efforts of attorneys fighting for the rights of their clients, we will finally know the truth about GM&#x2019;s ignition switch recall.

The birth injury was caused by severe oxygen deprivation, and the prognosis was not good. According to the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-ismie-malpractice-judgment-1112-biz-20151111-story.html">Chicago Tribune</a>, their daughter lived only three years because of the severe brain injury caused by the doctors at Rush North Shore Hospital.

The Hanas went through years of painful litigation that constantly reminded them of the daughter they lost. Finally, on November 10, a jury found that Ismie Mutual Insurance had acted in bad faith by withholding information from the obstetricians and concealing a settlement offer. While the legal battle is over, the Hanas live on with the pain on losing a child because of their doctor&#x2019;s negligence.
<h2>Birth injuries by the numbers</h2>
Unfortunately, the Hanas are not alone. The <a href="http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb74.pdf">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</a>, a division of the US Department of Health &amp; Human Services, compiled information about birth injuries to both mother and child from hospitals across the nation. The numbers are shocking:
<ul>
    <li>Nearly 157,700 potentially avoidable injuries to mothers and newborns occurred during childbirth in 2006 (the last year for which data is available), and obstetrical traumas occurring during vaginal births with instruments accounted for the highest injury rates.</li>
    <li>Newborns covered by Medicaid had worse (i.e., higher) newborn injury rates than newborns covered by private insurance, though there appeared to be no differences in the rates of newborn injury between the wealthiest and poorest communities.</li>
    <li>For all delivery types, rates of obstetrical trauma for mothers were highest among women living in the wealthiest communities, and women with private insurance had higher obstetrical trauma rates than those with Medicaid.</li>
    <li>Injury to the newborn occurred most often in those living in non-urban areas, while rates of obstetrical trauma for mothers were highest among women in large metropolitan areas. Although, the Northeast had one of the highest rates of obstetrical trauma with instrument assistance, it also had significantly worse rates of injury to the newborn.</li>
</ul>
As we can see, injuries during childbirth are more common than we think. Unfortunately, most birth injuries have consequences that last a lifetime. When a doctor makes a mistake during childbirth, you and your family can find your lives changed forever.

Birth injuries may not be evident for months.

This includes considering the possibility that you may be unable to stand or walk on your own, especially following surgery or the administration of drugs.

Whether hospital falls constitute malpractice is often hotly debated. <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/do-hospital-falls-equal-medical-malpractice">The National Law Review</a> reports &#x201C;There has been some inconsistency in determinations among... courts... on this issue. This makes it very difficult to determine or predict whether a hospital fall case will be deemed a medical malpractice and, therefore, subject to the medical malpractice procedural requirements.&#x201D;
<h2>Hospitals will try to protect themselves</h2>
It would be better in all cases for the hospitals and their insurance carriers if all falls were classified as general negligence instead of medical malpractice. However, the reality of the situation is that your doctors, nurses, and others are responsible for your safety while you are hospitalized.

According to the <a href="http://nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ANAMarketplace/ANAPeriodicals/OJIN/TableofContents/Vol-18-2013/No2-May-2013/Fall-Program-Measurement.html">American Nurses Association</a>, &#x201C;Falls represent a major public health problem around the world. In the hospital setting, falls continue to be the number one adverse event with approximately 3-20% of inpatients falling at least once during their hospitalization. Of those, 30 to 51% of falls in hospitals result in some injury (<a href="http://nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ANAMarketplace/ANAPeriodicals/OJIN/TableofContents/Vol-18-2013/No2-May-2013/Fall-Program-Measurement.html#Oliver">Oliver, Healey, &amp; Haines, 2010</a>). Of these, 6 to 44% experience similar types of injury (e.g.,&#xA0;fracture, subdural hematomas, or excessive bleeding) that may lead to death.&#x201D;

Hospital falls are often preventable. The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2974438/">National Institutes of Health</a> published a report that found a strong correlation between adequate staffing and hospital falls. Patients often fell after:
<ul>
    <li>Getting out of bed after a call button went unanswered</li>
    <li>Suffering balance problems or weakness after being overmedicated</li>
    <li>Being transferred without adequate staff to lift patient</li>
    <li>Improperly using bed rails</li>
</ul>
If you or a loved one suffered injuries after a fall during a hospital stay, you may be the victim of medical malpractice. Often, there is a time limit for filing a claim. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate the details of your case and determine whether you may be entitled to compensation. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation.

For the last four years, they have offered an analysis of medical malpractice payouts throughout the country, to help their clients understand the changing world in which they practice medicine. The <a href="http://www.diederichhealthcare.com/the-standard/2015-medical-malpractice-payout-analysis/">2015 analysis</a> covers amounts from 2014, and once again the amount of the payouts has increased overall. Ohio experienced a small dip in numbers (-3.31%) but Kentucky went up +48.8% from the year before.
<h2>Why the payments were made</h2>
According to Diederich Healthcare&#x2019;s findings, diagnostic errors led the pack for the most malpractice payouts, at 33%, followed by surgical errors (24%) and treatment errors (19%). This information supports other research we have discussed about the increase in inaccurate diagnoses. The analysis also revealed which kinds of injuries made up those payments:
<ul>
    <li>Death, 30%</li>
    <li>Significant permanent injury, 18%</li>
    <li>Major permanent injury, 17%</li>
    <li>Minor permanent injury, 9%</li>
    <li>Major temporary injury, 8%</li>
    <li>Other, 5%</li>
</ul>
That death leads the group by a significant percentage is worrisome, though that does not detract from the severity of an unidentified &#x201C;significant permanent injury&#x201D; in any way. Furthermore, the average wrongful death payment amounted to just over $350,000 &#x2013; less than significant permanent injuries or major permanent injuries, and less than payments made to those who suffered with paralysis or brain damage, which would then require life-long care. This begs the question: if quadriplegia and brain damage are not considered &#x201C;significant&#x201D; or &#x201C;major&#x201D; permanent injuries, <em>what is</em>?
<h2>Where that leaves us</h2>
While Ohio may not have seen an increase in medical malpractice payouts this year, victims still collected almost $6.7 million dollars, a significant amount. In Kentucky, the total amount of medical malpractice payouts fell just shy of $4.9 million.

Ideally, the payout for medical malpractice claims would be zero, because there would be zero acts of negligence leading to such claims. At least now, though, we have a better idea of what kinds of claims people are making, here in Ohio and Kentucky, and throughout the country. If healthcare providers were as transparent at the Diederich Group is, we would all have a better chance of choosing a doctor who is right for us.

We have looked into the effects of sleep deprivation in nurses, and it stands to reason that they are not the only group of medical professionals who could hurt you or themselves is too fatigued to work.

Because of this, a study was done in 2011 by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education which limited the number of hours a resident could work, and hospitals around the country followed suit by adopting those restrictions. Now, a new study is testing whether or not patient care improves if the same doctor stays with the patient from the beginning &#x2013; and that means some young doctors might be working shifts that last for 30 hours or more.
<h2>The details of the study</h2>
The impetus for the study revolves round the idea that patients who are handed off from doctor to doctor in the initial hours of their visit are in more danger of being hurt, harmed or neglected in some way, or that it is more likely that mistakes can be made when a patient does not have one constant doctor monitoring his or her recovery. The research is funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, and is being run by the University of Pennsylvania.

The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/some-new-doctors-are-working-30-hour-shifts-at-hospitals-around-the-us/2015/10/28/ab7e8948-7b83-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html">Washington Post</a> reports that:

&#x201C;6,000 internal medicine trainees at 63 programs across the country [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][are participating in the study]. About 2,400 are first-year physicians&#x2026;. 31 programs will stick to current rules on resident work hours. Along with the 16-hour limit for first-year trainees, second- and third-year doctors are restricted to 24 consecutive hours of work. Residents may not work more than 80 hours a week, must have one day off every seven days and may not work overnight more often than every three days &#x2014; all averaged over one month.&#x201D;

The remaining 32 programs leave scheduling up to the director&#x2019;s discretion. If the director wishes to put residents on for 30-hour long shifts, he or she can.
<h2>Why this might prove to be a terrible idea</h2>
Aside from the obvious dangers of being treated by a sleep-deprived doctor &#x2013; or a doctor who feels obligated to take OTC caffeine pills in order to stay awake &#x2013; patients will be seen by new, young medical students. First, second and even third year residents may not have the adequate knowledge to respond to a crisis appropriately even when they are fully rested, let alone when they are exhausted. Yes, there must come a time when they are pushed from the nest, so to speak &#x2013; but adding the burden of sleep deprivation right at the beginning could lead to disastrous results.

Furthermore, this study began less than half a year ago, in July. We were unable to locate any information regarding which programs were participating in the study, with the exception of any listed in the Post article and any programs in New York, which are by law unable to participate. The ethics panel at U Penn &#x201C;deemed the study&#x2019;s risk to patients and new doctors minimal, and said <strong>hospitals did not have to inform either</strong>&#x201D; (emphasis ours) about their participation in the study, which means it is entirely possible that your recent trip to the hospital put you in the care of a second-year resident who had not slept in the last 24 hours &#x2013; <em>and no one was required to tell you.</em>

Even if the study proves that longer shifts can improve patient safety, the lack of transparency &#x2013; the inability of a consumer to obtain crucial information about his or her health provider, to make an informed decision about how he or she wishes to be treated &#x2013; seems dishonest and wrong. You should be allowed to know how long your doctor will work in each shift, and to decide whether or not you feel comfortable sticking with one healthcare provider or being seen by more than one.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we believe that healthcare providers and facilities owe you a duty of care that extends to pertinent information such as how long your doctor might be on-shift. If you are injured because a sleep-deprived doctor was incapable of making the right decision to protect you, you may have a claim for medical negligence.

Nestl&#xE9; offers over 20 varieties of the microwave turnovers, ranging from breakfast to dessert. The frozen products have fed children and adults alike for over 30 years. But recently, the brand added a new skill set to its r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;.

Jason Bartley was running errands on November 10. On his way home, he took extra time to stop and grab some Hot Pockets. The detour, it appears, may have saved his life.
<h2>Saved by a craving for a snack?</h2>
Jason lives at an apartment complex in Akron; his building turned into a raging inferno that Tuesday when a plane lost control and crashed into the building. According to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ohio-plane-crash-man-buy-hot-pockets/">CBS News</a>, &#x201C;The 10-seat Hawker H25 business jet clipped utility wires and crashed into the four-unit apartment building, sparking a fire that destroyed the building, Ohio State Highway Patrol Lt. Bill Haymaker said. Nobody was home at any of the apartments, and there were no other injuries.&#x201D;

The plane was scheduled to land at a small airport just two miles from the apartment building. Because Jason decided to stop for the Hot Pockets, he was not at home when the plane crashed into his building.

Roberta Porter, who lives a block away from the apartment, also suffered a near miss. She was driving home when she saw the plane drop suddenly and crash into the building. She admitted to CBS News that if she had been driving faster, the plane could have clipped her car.
<h2>The real truth about accidents</h2>
This story, though terrifying, is an example of how news media contribute to perceptions of artificial risks. Plane crashes dominate headlines because of the nature and scale of the destruction they cause. However, both Jason Bartley and Roberta Porter were far more likely to have been in a car accident that day than to have been struck by the business jet. Consider this data from a report by <a href="http://traveltips.usatoday.com/air-travel-safer-car-travel-1581.html">USA Today</a>:

&#x201C;The National Transportation Safety Board compiles aviation accident data. Preliminary statistics for 2008 show only 20 accidents for U.S. air carriers operating scheduled service. This works out to nearly zero accidents per million flying miles. No one died, and only five people were seriously injured.&#x201D;

While we have seen more news reports in recent years about plane crashes, they really are far rarer than the media would let you believe. Car accidents, on the other hand, happen every day, and the consequences can be devastating.

So it is our great pleasure to announce that former President Jimmy Carter is cancer free thanks to a new drug. In early December, he announced to his Sunday school class at his church that doctors did not find any cancer at all during his last visit.
<h2>Advanced cancer responds to new drug</h2>
Carter suffers from stage 4 melanoma. According to the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/basics/definition/con-20026009">Mayo Clinic</a>, &#x201C;Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin &#x2014; the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can also form in your eyes and, rarely, in internal organs, such as your intestines.&#x201D; The advanced stage of Carter&#x2019;s melanoma means that cancerous cells have spread throughout his entire body.

The former President believes his remission is directly linked to a new cancer drug called Keytruda. The drug, generically known as pembrolizumab, uses a different approach to fighting cancer. While most drugs on the market work to boost and support the immune system, Keytruda disrupts a tumor&#x2019;s ability to hide from the immune system, letting the body&#x2019;s natural defenses work to shrink tumors in combination with other therapies like radiation.

According to a recent report by <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/heres-look-keytruda-drug-jimmy-carter-says-made-his-tumors-n475561">NBC News</a>, &#x201C;...cancer experts note that it&apos;s not at all clear that the drug itself is what shrank Carter&apos;s tumors. The former president was also treated with radiation to his brain and had a large tumor on his liver removed.&#x201D; However, the success rate of advanced cancer treatment with Keytruda is undeniable.
<h2>Hope for advanced cancer sufferers</h2>
The success rate of Keytruda is so great that the Food and Drug Administration gave it accelerated approval in 2014. The FDA based the accelerated approval on a study led by Dr. Antoni Ribas of the University of California Los Angeles. The clinical trial found that Keytruda shrunk tumors for over 70% of patients, and the effects continued even after the drug was no longer being administered.

While the cure for cancer remains elusive, treatment is making huge strides. Keytruda is just one of them; teams of researchers around the world are responsible for making people healthier than ever. We at Crandall &amp; Pera Law support the efforts of everyone who works to improve the quality of life.

It was written by <a href="http://bennetomalufoundation.org/about-bennet-omalu/">Bennet Omalu</a>, the man who discovered the link between chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and football. The new Will Smith movie, <em>Concussion,</em> is based upon Dr. Omalu&#x2019;s work in this area. To say that it is an op-ed worth reading is an understatement, because no one understands the dangers as well as he does.

Dr. Omalu believes that a legal age restriction should be placed upon those who want to play football. He writes:

&#x201C;The human brain becomes fully developed at about 18 to 25 years old. We should at least wait for our children to grow up, be provided with the information and education on the risk of play, and let them make their own decisions. No adult, not a parent or a coach, should be allowed to make this potentially life-altering decision for a child.

We have a legal age for drinking alcohol; for joining the military; for voting; for smoking; for driving; and for consenting to have sex. We must have the same when it comes to protecting the organ that defines who we are as human beings.&#x201D;

In some ways, the argument we have been making mirrors Dr. Omalu&#x2019;s, especially when it comes to not letting your children play football. CTE can have devastating effects on people who engage in contact sports, and the effects may not be apparent until much, much later in life. The traumatic contact can destroy the neurons in our brains, and as the doctor puts it, &#x201C;In more than 30 years of looking at normal brain cells in the microscope, I have yet to see a neuron that naturally creates a new neuron to regenerate itself. We are born with a certain number of neurons. We can only lose them; we cannot create new neurons to replenish old or dying ones.&#x201D; Once those neurons are gone, they are gone for good &#x2013; and no amount of therapy or medication can bring them back.
<h2>This is not an outlier opinion</h2>
In October, we wrote about schools throughout the country that are disbanding their football teams, as a result of poor turnout for the players. Many times, the decisions are brought about by the students themselves; their parents did not forbid them to play &#x2013; they simply chose not to.

It is also important to remember that football players are not the only ones at risk. All contact sports which present the opportunity to sustain a head or brain injury &#x2013; boxing, mixed martial arts, hockey, rugby and even soccer, to some extent &#x2013; can increase your child&#x2019;s risk of developing CTE.

Permanent brain damage and a life of debilitating pain, mental confusion or personality changes are no longer hypotheticals. These are real, proven effects of CTE. It is time we put the safety of our children before tradition, and considered making football a game for adults only.

It&#x2019;s time to stop choosing football. Choose the future. Choose your children. Choose life.

For now, however the products remain unregulated, and there is a distinct lack of information about the potential harm that the popular product could cause.

In light of that fact, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health designed a study to test flavored e-cigarettes and e-cigarette liquids for hazardous flavoring compounds. The results were published in <em>Environmental Health Perspectives </em>in early December, and the findings are devastating to say the least.
<h2>Study find most e-cigarettes contain hazardous substances</h2>
The team tested 51 sample substances for the chemicals diacetyl, acetoin, and 2,3 pentanedione. Diacetyl is linked to a condition known as &#x201C;popcorn lung&#x201D; (because it first showed up in workers inhaling popcorn flavoring). The other two chemicals are classified as &#x201C;high priority&#x201D; respiratory threats by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association. The team found that 47 of the 51 flavors contained at least one of the three chemicals.

Study co-author David Christiani, Elkan Blout Professor of Environmental Genetics, told <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/12/popcorn-lung-seen-in-e-cigarette-smokers/">Harvard News</a>, &#x201C;Since most of the health concerns about e-cigarettes have focused on nicotine, there is still much we do not know about e-cigarettes. In addition to containing varying levels of the addictive substance nicotine, they also contain other cancer-causing chemicals, such as formaldehyde, and as our study shows, flavoring chemicals that can cause lung damage.&#x201D;
<h2>Respiratory damage not the only risk</h2>
The lack of federal regulation does not just pose a risk of respiratory disease. Faulty power supplies and improper combinations of parts have resulted in exploding e-cigarettes that cause serious physical harm. While further research is required, the most effective way to reduce the dangers of e-cigarettes would be regulation at the federal level.

Until legislation is enacted that gives the FDA the authority to regulate these devices, you and your loved ones remain at risk. If you or someone you know has developed a chronic respiratory condition after using an e-cigarette, or been injured by a faulty device, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced personal Ohio and Kentucky injury attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can fight for your rights and help get you the compensation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact us </a>today for a free consultation.

David Antoon underwent surgery to remove his cancerous prostate gland in January of 2008. The cancer is gone, but Antoon was left impotent, incontinent, and unable to work following the allegedly botched surgery.
<h2>Why the Supreme Court is involved</h2>
Ohio allows a four-year window to file suit for medical malpractice. With a new filing in the Supreme Court in 2015, Antoon is well outside the four-year window. However, he claims that the Cleveland Clinic obstructed his ability to file a suit within the appropriate time frame by denying access to records and other discovery. The delays caused by the Clinic caused Antoon to drop his first suit in 2011 because of rising legal costs.

<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2015/12/ohio_supreme_court_to_decide_f.html">Cleveland.com</a> summed up the heart of the issue concisely, reporting, &#x201C;Over the past six years, Antoon has filed several lawsuits and regulatory complaints seeking to pierce what he describes as a veil of medical secrecy surrounding his case. In 2010, CMS cited the Clinic for failing to take appropriate actions to resolve Antoon&apos;s complaints, withholding information in a complaint file from an inspector, and failing to maintain proper consent forms for surgical patients.&#x201D;
<h2>Proof would drop the suit</h2>
The root of the contention is whether or not Antoon&#x2019;s surgeon, Dr. Jihad Kaouk, was present during his surgery. The CMS, in a separate inspection, found that Kaouk was performing what are known as concurrent surgeries, using doctors-in-training and other support staff to handle the routine details of surgery and only going hands-on during part of the procedure. While this is not unusual, it is important to Antoon, so much so that he offered to drop his lawsuit if the hospital could prove that Dr. Kaouk was present in the operating room.

The case is making waves because of the elapsed time. Heather Stutz, an attorney for the Ohio Hospital Association (among others), said, &#x201C;Litigating a claim more than four years after the alleged malpractice presents the same difficulties in terms of obtaining relevant and reliable evidence, imposing an unacceptable burden on [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][medical] providers.&#x201D;

While the case appears to be fairly straightforward, in that the Cleveland Clinic intentionally denied discovery to prevent Antoon from successfully pursuing a case, the devil is in the details. The Cleveland Clinic has a reputation for malpractice; our own Steve Crandall successfully fought and won a malpractice case against the Cleveland Clinic, resulting in a $7.7 million verdict for his client.

Whatever the circumstances, medical malpractice is devastating to its victims. If you or someone you know has been a victim, the compassionate and experienced medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can be your advocates. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation with an experienced medical malpractice lawyer in Ohio or Kentucky.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]

Parents snapped up the toy anywhere they could get it, and with the high demand, it was inevitable that the market would be flooded with knock-offs when the original manufacturer couldn&#x2019;t keep up.

It wasn&#x2019;t long before problems began to crop up; <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/why-hoverboards-keep-exploding/">WIRED</a> reported in mid-December that &#x201C;An exploding two-wheeler&#xA0;burned down a house in Louisiana&#xA0;a few weeks ago;&#xA0;another scooter&#xA0;combusted in the same state in the past week. A gyroboard caused significant damage to a home&#xA0;in New York&#xA0;a few days ago. Ata mall in Washington this week, a scooterboard caught fire and shoppers were forced to evacuate. The perceived danger is significant enough that major airlines have banned the little vehicles altogether.&#x201D;
<h2>Why is this happening?</h2>
Sometimes the boards are plugged in and charging; sometimes, they seem to explode for no reason during use. The problem lies with the Lithium Ion batteries used in the devices. Li-ion batteries power just about everything we use on a daily basis, from cell phones to tablets and laptops. These expensive devices use high-quality batteries from reputable manufacturers.

With the production rush for the holiday season, manufacturers of hoverboards turned to mass-produced li-ion batteries from China. Quality control at some of these plants is less than ideal, and can result in an internal misalignment that can cause the batteries to short and discharge all of their stored power explosively. Even if the product is manufactured correctly, constant collisions can damage the delicate internal components with the same result.

Even if the batteries are fine, the charging cables may be defective. Jay Whitacre, Professor of Materials Science &amp; Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, said, &#x201C;If there is not proper protection to the cells, and if the charger is defective, the cells can be severely overcharged. In cases of severe overcharge, even perfectly made cells will eventually fail...&#x201D;
<h2>Keep your children safe</h2>
Parents everywhere be warned; there is no clear way to know which devices are affected. Worse, there is no good way to test for the problem, which can manifest after just a few charges or after hundreds of uses. If getting the device out of your house isn&#x2019;t an option, keep a fire extinguisher handy and only charge the devices under supervision.

If you or someone you know has been injured because of a defective product, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky defective product attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation.

In that writing, we discussed the state of long-term care in the Bluegrass State, noting in particular that 40% of nursing homes ranked &#x201C;below average&#x201D; according to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. That number means that your loved one is at higher risk of nursing abuse or neglect simply by living in a long-term care facility in Kentucky.

Recognizing signs of abuse or neglect in your loved one can be difficult. While some signs and symptoms are obvious, others are more challenging. Coupled with the emotional involvement, it can be extremely hard to admit that your loved one has been a victim at the hands of a trusted care provider.
<h2>Keeping your loved ones safe</h2>
The best way to prevent the mistreatment of your loved one in a long-term care facility is to visit as frequently as you can. If you cannot visit as often as you would like, try to remain in near-constant contact, either though the phone or through the computer. (You might be surprised how much your parent or grandparent loves using a smartphone or tablet for face-to-face communication.) Being involved in your love one&#x2019;s life is the best way to catch a problem early on. Ask about daily activities, including medications and physical therapy, staff interactions, and anything else that comes to mind. The best preventer of abuse and neglect is information.

Additionally, look for these common signs when you are visiting:
<ul>
    <li>Unexplained injuries, including cuts, bruises, burns and broken bones</li>
    <li>Bedsores</li>
    <li>Changes in behavior</li>
    <li>Physical or emotional withdrawal</li>
    <li>Weight change/malnutrition</li>
    <li>Depression</li>
    <li>Unresponsiveness</li>
    <li>Poor hygiene</li>
    <li>Unexplained hair loss</li>
    <li>Unexplained bleeding</li>
    <li>Missing items</li>
    <li>Out of the ordinary financial transactions</li>
</ul>
Elder abuse or neglect can take many forms; psychological and emotional abuse are devastating, and physical abuse can be deadly, but financial abuse can leave you and your family unable to provide continuing care for your loved one. Don&#x2019;t let embarrassment hurt your loved one; talk to them and take immediate steps if you suspect any type of abuse or neglect.

Hospitals, however, are still businesses, and for every doctor or nurse who genuinely cares about us, there is an administrator somewhere looking at the bottom line. A recent article on <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2016/01/14/report-cincinnati-hospital-profits-up-2014/78739080/">Cincinnati.com</a> reports that Cincinnati&#x2019;s hospitals experienced a &#x201C;surge in net income&#x201D; in 2014 &#x2013; a combined $645.1 million throughout Greater Cincinnati.

Admittedly, a large percentage of this income is derived from investments and grants, as well as philanthropic efforts on behalf of others, but the problem we have is not really with the amount of money the hospitals have made. It is with the fact that a large portion of the money has gone to increasing the capacity of the hospitals even though attendance is dropping. It is not that fewer people need hospitals; it is that the amount of time patients are allowed to stay is decreasing. According to independent market analyst Allan Baumgarten&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ohio Health Market Review,&#x201D;&#xA0;occupancy levels are lower now than they were in 2008.
<h2>Why all the expansion?</h2>
So why keep building and acquiring facilities if patients are being forced into shorter stays? It could be related to the increase in Medicare and Medicaid subscribers throughout Ohio. It works like this: the government funds the costs of in-patient stays for Medicare subscribers, and contributes to the cost for Medicaid subscribers. With more people enrolling, the hospitals have a valid claim to increase the size of their facilities. However, because no hospital is going to pick up the cost of an overnight stay once the government stops paying for it, those patients are forced out, too. In the end, it looks like you need more space &#x2013; and can then justify that expense &#x2013; even though your occupancy levels are lower now than ever.

No one wants to stay in the hospital longer than they need to, but shortening hospital stays can lead to a slew of problems. Unfortunately, the longer stays that so many patients need are now astronomically high (<a href="http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/lists/average-cost-per-inpatient-day-across-50-states-in-2010.html">more than $2500 a night in Ohio</a>, and that was back in 2010; the prices have almost certainly risen since then) that people are forced to leave. We believe that every patient&#x2019;s need for care trumps the needs of big business.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight on behalf of people whose lives have changed irreparably because of poor care or negligence. If you or your loved one was released too early from a hospital and suffered a preventable injury or illness because of it, we may be able to help.

The report is encouraging; our nation&#x2019;s roadways have never had a safer year. Unfortunately, data trends have to continue in order to show progress, and preliminary data for 2015 shows &#x201C;a troubling increase in the number of fatalities&#x201D; according to the agency itself.
<h2>Good news first</h2>
The total number of traffic fatalities for the year 2014 came in at 32,675. While more than 30,000 deaths is nothing to celebrate, it is the lowest number of fatalities in over a decade. More encouraging is the rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (100Mvmt). In 1990, there were 2.08 deaths per 100Mvmt; in 2014, that number was nearly halved, coming in at 1.07.

These numbers were excellent, especially in light of the circumstances. There are more cars on the road now than there were in 90s, and more cars means more miles traveled. For all that, 2014 is still the safest year on record. Sadly, 32,675 deaths is still far too many; <a href="http://kpic.com/news/auto-matters/auto-fatality-rate-hits-historic-low-in-2014-but-early-stats-on-2015-are-sobering">KPIC 4</a> reported on why:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Drunk driving crashes</strong> continue to represent roughly one-third of fatalities, resulting in 9,967 deaths in 2014.</li>
    <li>Nearly half (49%) of passenger vehicle occupants killed were <strong>not wearing seat belts</strong>.</li>
    <li>The number of <strong>motorcyclists killed</strong> was far higher in states without strong helmet laws, resulting in 1,565 lives lost in 2014.</li>
    <li><strong>Cyclist deaths</strong> declined by 2.3 percent, but pedestrian deaths rose by 3.1 percent from the previous year. In 2014, there were 726 cyclists and 4,884 pedestrians killed in motor vehicle crashes.</li>
    <li><strong>Distracted driving</strong> accounted for 10 percent of all crash fatalities, killing 3,179 people in 2014.</li>
    <li><strong>Drowsy driving</strong> accounted for 2.6 percent of all crash fatalities; at least 846 people died in these crashes in 2014.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bad news for next years&#x2019; report</h2>
With preliminary data suggesting that traffic fatalities were up more than 8% in 2015, Secretary Anthony Foxx of the U.S. Department of Transportation says the agency will put greater effort into safety initiatives. Unfortunately, the NHTSA blames human error for 94% of all collisions, meaning that safety initiatives may not be enough.

The 2014 NHTSA traffic fatality report is encouraging, but it still reports 32,675 deaths. Those numbers do not tell the whole story; 32,675 families lost a loved one that year, affecting untold numbers of lives. When someone you love is hurt or injured in an accident, life is never the same.

If you or a loved one has been injured in an accident, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries, lost wages, and more. The experienced and compassionate personal injury attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help fight for your rights and get you the compensation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us </a>today for a free consultation in one of our offices throughout Kentucky and Ohio.

The truck was loaded with phosphoric and sulfuric acid. A mix of the toxic substances, as well as diesel fuel from the damaged truck, leaked into the stream in the popular recreational area.
<h2>Hazmat spill has dire consequences</h2>
The site was closed for two days while crews worked to contain the spill and clean the area, but the damage was done almost immediately. According to <a href="http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20151119/officials-thousands-of-fish-die-in-creek-after-central-ohio-truck-crash">The News Herald</a>, &#x201C;State Department of Natural Resources&#x2019; Division of Wildlife spokeswoman Karen Norris... [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][told] The Columbus Dispatch [that]&#xA0;nearly 6,400 fish were killed in Raccoon Creek in Newark. The crash and spill affected about 1.5 miles of the Licking County stream.&#x201D;

This spill is devastating beyond the local contamination. The Raccoon Creek Partnership has spent more than 30 years and countless hours of volunteer efforts to clean up the creek. The area had been devastated by mining activities, leaving the overall health of the watershed severely compromised. A 1984 sampling of the creek found only two fish, both of the same species. In 2005, thanks to the partnership&#x2019;s efforts, 244 fish representing 13 species were thriving in the river.

This single accident represents a significant setback to a three-decade effort by thousands of volunteers. One moment of inattention, and years of dedicated effort were erased. The driver has been charged with failure to maintain control, though no trial date has been set as of this writing.
<h2>Cargo spills pose threat to all</h2>
Though regrettable, this incident is not unique. Fuel and cargo spills are all too common during big rig accidents. Whether they are the result of distracted driving or negligent loading practices, cargo spillage can have devastating impacts on our environment and create significant health hazards for drivers and emergency responders. This is yet another instance that highlights the need for cohesive federal regulation of the trucking industry.

If you or someone you know has been injured in a trucking accident, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries. The experienced truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help fight for your rights, whether your injuries were the result of an accident or exposure to toxic substances. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation at one of our office locations throughout Ohio or Kentucky.

We applauded the fines, begged Honda to take action, and deplored the state of the auto industry that it would continually put its profits at the top of its priority list. It didn&#x2019;t seem like it could get any worse for Takata &#x2013; and then the <em>New York Times</em> dropped a bombshell on February 12, 2016: &#x201C;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/business/takata-discarded-evidence-of-airbag-ruptures-as-early-as-2000.html?_r=0">Takata Discarded Evidence of Airbag Ruptures as Early as 2000</a>.&#x201D;

The Times article reports that:

&#x201C;[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][T]estimony in a Florida court showed that Takata&#x2019;s own engineers discarded evidence that may have shown otherwise as long as 16 years ago. As early as 2000, around the time the propellant, which includes a compound called ammonium nitrate, was introduced into Takata models, failures occurred during internal testing.

But Takata altered its test data to hide the failures from its biggest customer, Honda, and a senior Takata executive ordered some of the evidence be discarded, the testimony said.&#x201D;

They knew. <strong>They knew.</strong> Takata <em>knew</em> it was manufacturing a product with the potential to fail, and <em>changed the data to hide the evidence.</em> This is worse than ignorance, worse than negligence; it is a criminal act. It is fraud. They are incredibly lucky that no one has charged them with manslaughter (as Forbes.com suggested <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/06/05/could-gm-be-charged-with-murder/">might be possible for GM</a> back in June of 2014). Those airbags have injured hundreds of people, and are directly linked to 10 deaths. They sold 54 million of those faulty inflators in the US alone.
<h2>Honda may not be as responsible as they first seemed</h2>
Because Takata manipulated its data regarding the airbag failures before it presented that data to Honda, Honda may not be accountable for as much of the blame as people originally thought. <strong>This does not mean they are innocent</strong>: remember, once the airbags started exploding, Honda was slow to recall the vehicles or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/business/air-bag-flaw-long-known-led-to-recalls.html">to admit there was a problem</a>. All this new information tells us is that Takata is an even greedier, more reprehensible company than we originally thought.

It is time to take drastic steps in this country to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens. Companies who commit crimes like these should be banned from doing business in the US, where they hurt our citizens intentionally and knowingly and then get away with it. Takata is not alone in this: if it were up to us, VW would be banned, too, for their actions last year with the emissions tests. Americans <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2010/04/16/Top-10-Class-Action-Lawsuits.html?slide=11">don&#x2019;t take lightly to lying</a> &#x2013; just ask AOL Time Warner, anyone working for Big Tobacco or the manufacturers of defective breast implants. From now on, maybe we should stop trying to boycott their products and simply refuse to allow them to sell anything in the US.

Marc&#x2019;s tireless dedication to his clients serves as the basis of the award, and as anyone in our offices can tell you, there is no one more deserving than him.
<h2>What is the American Institute of Personal Injury Attorneys?</h2>
The AIOPIA was founded in 2014 with a two-fold purpose: to provide people in need of skilled personal injury services with a way of choosing the right lawyer for those needs, and to honor those attorneys who have built a reputation for their positive relationships with their clients. <a href="http://aiopia.org/mission-statement/">As their website says</a>:

&#x201C;Attorneys who are recognized by the American Institute&#x2019;s Personal Injury Division are what we consider the best in the industry for client satisfaction. It is our mission to do so that the perspective new client will be able to take this knowledge and use it in making the tough decision on what attorney or firm to hire. It is the intent of American Institute&#x2019;s Personal Injury Division to aid these prospective new clients by saving them time and effort in their own research.&#x201D;

Attorneys like Marc Pera are nominated by their clients or their peers specifically because of their relationships with their clients. An independent Board of Regents reviews their status with the applicable State Bar to ensure that the lawyer has no grievances filed against him or her, looks into any publications, significant victories and/or professional associations, and then researches the attorneys&#x2019; reviews and ratings. If all of the criteria is met or exceeded &#x2013; you can <a href="http://aiopia.org/selection/">find the complete list here</a>, if you like &#x2013; the attorney is nominated for the award.

There are close to 5000 personal injury attorneys in Ohio. Marc Pera of Crandall &amp; Pera Law was selected as one of the 10 Best in the state &#x2013; not because of his track record of successful verdicts ad settlements (although he has that, too) but because of the highest levels of ethical service which he provides to his clients. When you work with Marc Pera, you work with an attorney who genuinely cares about the outcome of your case.

Congratulations on your latest award, Marc. We are all very proud of you &#x2013; even if we&#x2019;re not surprised that you won. You deserve it!

Every time you drive, you are sharing the road with uninsured motorists, and even the most defensive driver is still at risk from other motorists. Uninsured motorists are breaking the law, but worse, are posing a threat to you and your loved ones. A new House Bill is intended to incentivize drivers to comply with financial responsibility laws and reduce the risk to law-abiding citizens.
<h2>A growing threat</h2>
Jeff Smith, Director of Government Affairs for the Professional Independent Agents Association of Ohio, wrote a letter to <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/editorials/2016/01/16/1-house-bill-takes-aim-at-uninsured-motorists.html">The Columbus Dispatch</a>. He said, &#x201C;According to data from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, the risk of being involved in an accident on Ohio&#x2019;s roads has decreased by 21 percent in the last 10 years, but the likelihood of being involved in an accident with a motorist who is uninsured or who can&#x2019;t provide proof of insurance has gone up by 550 percent. To top it off, uninsured drivers were at fault in these crashes more than 65 percent of the time.&#x201D;

&#xA0;

The safest driver in the world still has no control over other drivers. Driving without insurance is a deeply irresponsible act with very real consequences. In almost every state, driving without car insurance is illegal. Despite this, the Insurance Research Council reported that in 2012, the most recent year for which data is available, uninsured motorists claims totaled $2.6 billion in the United States.

&#xA0;

If the proposed Bill is enacted, Ohio will join the ranks of 10 other states that have enacted &#x201C;no pay, no play&#x201D; laws. These laws limit an uninsured driver&#x2019;s ability to claim damages in an accident. According to the <a href="http://www.insurance-research.org/">Insurance Research Council</a>, &#x201C;no pay&#x201D; laws reduce uninsured motorist rates by 1.6% on average. That math still leaves over a million uninsured drivers on the road. It&#x2019;s a start, but more needs to be done to address the growing problem.

In the meantime, uninsured motorists continue to pose a threat to law-abiding citizens. If you or someone you know has been in an accident with an uninsured motorist, the experienced Kentucky and Ohio personal injury lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help get you the compensation that you need for medical expenses and lost wages. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation.

The scientific community met the report with skepticism, as no real research had been conducted up until then. Skepticism is the heart of science; without more work, it is possible that other factors were at play. However, a new report in January seems to support the earlier findings.
<h2>How Alzheimer&#x2019;s works</h2>
No one knows what causes Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, but we have learned a great deal about the effects. The disease disrupts the way the brain works at the chemical and electrical level. This happens when protein clusters, called amyloid plaques, build up between nerve cells. At the same time, twisted proteins build up between nerve cells. Over time, nerve cell death leads to loss of brain matter.

Amyloid plaques are observed after the disease is fairly progressed, and these plaques are what have researchers worried. The report in January detailed the autopsies of 7 people who had died as a result of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare brain-wasting disorder. All 7 of the people autopsied had received surgical grafts of a brain membrane years earlier. The grafts were unfortunately contaminated with a protein responsible for CJD.

According to a report in <a href="http://gizmodo.com/controvertial-transmittable-alzheimer-s-theory-is-sta-1755168062">Gizmodo</a>, &#x201C;Five of the seven brains analyzed also showed signs of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. This was odd because the individuals, age 28 to 63, were too young to have developed the amyloid plaques indicative of the neurological disorder... This suggests that that the &#x2018;seeds&#x2019; of certain neurological diseases can be transmitted during certain medical procedures&#x2014;or even through contaminated surgical instruments.&#x201D;

The earlier autopsy report found that victims of CJD had acquired the disease from a growth hormone made from the glands of cadavers, some of which were contaminated with the proteins that cause the disease. While this growth hormone is no longer made the same way, it still remains a cause for concern.
<h2>Knowledge is power</h2>
The real danger is that amyloid plaques are sticky, and standard sterilization techniques don&#x2019;t work on them. This means that it is possible to transfer amyloid plaques through surgery. However, these findings are actually a good thing. Neuropathologist Herbert Budka, co-author of the latest paper, told <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/more-evidence-emerges-for-transmissible-alzheimer-s-theory-1.19229">Nature News</a>, &#x201C;It is our job as doctors to see in advance what might become a problem in the clinic.&#x201D;

The bill proposes to create review panels that would screen medical malpractice claims for patients seeking judgment. While the Bill has been amended several times, the primary goal remains the same. In fact, we wrote about this issue at the same time last year.
<h2>What they want you to believe</h2>
Senator Alvarado believes that the creation of review panels would save time and money for those pursuing a medical malpractice claim. The review panels would be chaired by an attorney and populated by three physicians. One of each of the physicians would be chosen by the plaintiff and defendant, and the partially formed committee would select the third.

Supporters of the bill maintain that the creation of these panels would accomplish three main goals. They believe that SB 6 would:
<ul>
    <li>Prevent frivolous lawsuits and save time and money for claimants.</li>
    <li>Reduce the amount of malpractice claims.</li>
    <li>Reduce the amount of time it takes to resolve a malpractice claim.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why the reality is such a terrible idea</h2>
The big hype centers on the time period for review; <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2016/01/15/medical-malpractice-lawsuit-kentucky-legislation.html">press about the bill</a> &#x201C;claims&#x201D; that the panel has 30 days to decide the merit of a case. Unfortunately, and as usual, this isn&#x2019;t the full story. As a matter of fact, it&#x2019;s not even the <em>right</em> story.

Medical malpractice cases are incredibly complex. They can involve multiple acts of negligence from multiple providers, and even a specially convened panel of three doctors will likely not have the expertise necessary to evaluate a claim. Additionally, the 30-day time frame is not just a misrepresentation; it is an outright lie. Based on the language in the bill, it can take an average of <em>six months </em>just to file a claim. The entire time you are waiting for your claim to come before this panel, you&#x2019;ll need to foot your doctors&#x2019; bills, deal with losing your income, and living with the pain of your injury. Our review of other states&#x2019; experience with review panels demonstrates that the average time to file a claim is closer to 18 months.

Senate Bill 6 is a solution in search of a problem, and it is a terrible solution. The following are the counterpoints to the goals of SB 6:
<ul>
    <li>There are already stiff penalties in place for bringing frivolous lawsuits.</li>
    <li>Reducing malpractice claims comes from reducing malpractice, not tort reform.</li>
    <li>Convening specialized panels for each case will greatly increase the amount of time it takes to get a case to court, not decrease it.</li>
</ul>
The candidate selection process for the review panel would require doctors, working with a lawyer, to decide whether a claim had merit before it was tried in court. The panel is made up of local doctors who are far more likely to side with their colleagues than with you, if for no other reason than they know that someday they may be sitting on the other side of the table awaiting judgment rather than being the Judge. Following their decision, the panel would publish an expert opinion that could be used at trial. That opinion would be virtually un-appealable. If the panel gets it wrong, if a mistake is made in the process, if the judgment is unfair, you will have little to no legal recourse moving forward, because the legislature has essentially taken away your right for a fair impartial trial by your peers &#x2013; a right that is guaranteed by the Kentucky constitution, as well as the United States Constitution.

The 7<sup>th</sup> Amendment guarantees the right to a trial by jury. When a jury is convened to hear a case, the members of the jury are members of the community. In this way, trial by jury ensures that a community is able to regulate conduct locally. In this way, a community is given a voice to the benefit of all. It is unfathomable that doctors should be shielded from judgement by the community. No other profession is given such an elite status. If this bill is allowed to pass, why shouldn&#x2019;t every person only be judged by someone who works in the same field as them? Shouldn&#x2019;t engineers, teachers, lawyers, electricians and heavy-machinery operators be afforded the right to a review panel of their friends, rather than be judged by randomly selected members of their community? Fortunately, that is not the way the system works. Lawyers and judges go to great lengths to educate the uneducated jury about the issues so that they can make a fair and impartial decision.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight for your rights. All citizens are entitled to a trial by jury; the type of claim does not change that right. Victims of medical malpractice suffer enough. It is a bridge too far to take away their constitutional rights. We are vehemently against SB 6.

Medical malpractice is devastating to victims and their families. The dedicated and experienced medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law work to protect these victims and make sure justice is served. If you or someone you know has been the victim of medical malpractice, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries. We can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation.

There are currently five confirmed cases of Zika virus in the state. While those cases were contracted in other parts of the world, mosquitoes are able to pick up the virus and transmit it to others.
<h2>What is Zika virus?</h2>
According to <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/faq/genquestions.html#vaccine-available">the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), &#x201C;Zika is a disease caused by Zika virus that is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected&#xA0;<em>Aedes</em>&#xA0;species mosquito. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week.&#xA0;People usually don&#x2019;t get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika.&#x201D;

Unfortunately, Zika disease has been linked to an increase in the birth defect known as microcephaly. Pregnant women who have been infected can give birth to children that suffer reduced brain growth resulting in smaller head size. The condition can cause lifelong problems, including seizures, developmental delays and disabilities.

The problem with Zika is that after the initial symptoms, it can be difficult to detect. The virus lives on in the host, and common antibody tests are ineffective because the tests cross-react with Dengue fever antibodies and can produce a false positive.

Mosquitoes capable of carrying the disease are common in the US and exist in pockets all over the state. In response to the five known cases and the potential threat for widespread infection in Ohio, public health officials gathered in early March to discuss preparedness.
<h2>Zika related birth defects are a cause for concern</h2>
Dr. Mary DiOrio, medical director of the Ohio Department of Health, told <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/03/01/State-holds-Zika-exercise.html">The Columbus Dispatch</a> that talks were expected to focus on mosquito control and public outreach. She said, &#x201C;My hope from this exercise is that, by having these conversations now, we will know exactly &#x2014; if we get a case of Zika during our mosquito season &#x2014; what steps will be taken by all of the entities in that area.&quot;

You can reduce the mosquito population in your area by eliminating standing water on and around your property. However, these precautions cannot guarantee that Zika won&#x2019;t be in Ohio this spring. So far, no residents have tested positive for the disease, but only time will tell.

If your child has suffered a birth defect as a result of trauma or substandard prenatal care, you may be entitled to compensation.

Biotechnology giant Monsanto is the company that no one knows about. Founded in 1901, the company initially produced food additives before expanding into industrial chemicals. During a growth phase, the company manufactured controversial products including DDT, Agent Orange, and others. Today, the biotech behemoth is a multinational corporation; they have divested much of their chemical business and focus primarily on biotechnology.

Unfortunately, some of the controversial decisions made by Monsanto in the past continue to cause problems today. For more than forty years, Monsanto was the sole producer of the chemical polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). Production during that time period amounted to almost 1.25 billion pounds of the chemical.

According to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/business/monsanto-could-benefit-from-a-chemical-safety-bill.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share">New York Times</a>, &#x201C;The chemicals were initially admired for their ability to prevent fires and explosions in electrical transformers and other equipment. But as the use of PCBs skyrocketed nationwide in products as varied&#xA0;as paints, pesticides and even carbonless copy paper, evidence mounted that they were contaminating the environment and potentially causing&#xA0;health problems including cancer and immune-system complications.&#xA0;<a href="http://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/epa-bans-pcb-manufacture-phases-out-uses">The E.P.A. banned their production in 1979</a>.&#x201D;

The PCB ban halted production, but did nothing to address the incredible amount of the chemical that was such an essential part of our infrastructure for so long. Now, older structures, including sewer systems and school buildings, are struggling to comply with new directives aimed at reducing PCB levels in water and building materials; renovations to remove contaminated materials are costly, and expose workers and building occupants to hazardous conditions.
<h2>A better future? Not yet</h2>
Pending legislation in Congress designed to replace the outdated Toxic Substances Control Act contains language that specifically addresses the Monsanto PCB problem, but not in a way that protects anyone. Instead, the paragraph could help shield the company from legal liability for a toxic chemical that only it made.

Seattle is one of six cities currently suing Monsanto to help cover the costs of removing the toxic substance. City attorney Pete Holmes said, &#x201C;Call me a dreamer, but I wish for a Congress that would help cities with their homeless crises instead of protecting multinational corporations that poison our environment.&#x201D; A spokeswoman for Monsanto said the company had received no preferential treatment.

The bottom line? Big businesses spend a great deal of time and money to protect their interests. When those efforts extend to the Federal government, closer scrutiny is required. Our government is supposed to protect our citizens, not the financial interests of individual corporations.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we work to protect your rights. When you are hurt or become sick because of a business decision that values dollars over lives, we fight for you and your family. Our skilled attorneys in Ohio and Kentucky have years of experience fighting big business and their insurance companies, and will fight for you when you need us. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us </a>today for a free consultation.

The problem lies with drug manufacturers and federal governments&#x2019; hands-off approach to medication regulation. The combination of factors means that 10% of the volume of 18 of the top 20 cancer drugs in the country is discarded every year.

Dr. Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering and co-author of the study, told the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/health/waste-in-cancer-drugs-costs-3-billion-a-year-a-study-says.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share">New York Times</a>, &#x201C;Drug companies are quietly making billions forcing little old ladies to buy enough medicine to treat football players, and regulators have completely missed it. If we&#x2019;re ever going to start saving money in health care, this is an obvious place to cut.&#x201D;
<h2>The problem is complex, but the solution is not</h2>
First, safety standards permit drug leftovers to be used in a six-hour timeframe, and even then only in special cases. Second, the US Food and Drug Administration rarely objects to proposed medication vial sizes, and is not empowered to consider cost in marketing decisions. Third, companies are responsible for proposing the vial sizes they would like to market. When it comes to expensive drugs, bigger is better for the bottom line.

Dr. Leonard Saltz, another co-author of the study, said, &#x201C;You have these incredibly expensive drugs, and you can only buy them in bulk. What&#x2019;s really interesting is they&#x2019;re selling these drugs in smaller vials in Europe, where regulators are clearly paying attention to this issue.&#x201D;

Clearly, manufacturers have the ability to resolve this issue; what they lack is the incentive. The two co-authors proposed a fairly simple solution; either require manufactures to provide enough options to reduce waste, or mandate that companies refund the government for wasted quantities. Either way, drug waste will be minimized and costs will be reduced.

In the midst of growing healthcare problems, our country can&#x2019;t afford to ignore a problem that increases cost with no added benefit. Too many of our citizens are unable to afford proper care, and skyrocketing costs have left others with crippling medical debt.

If you or someone you know has incurred significant medical costs from an accident, you may be entitled to compensation to offset those costs.

The early morning accident happened on a sharp curve of Madison Pike in Fiskburg when a tractor-trailer pushed a pickup truck off the road, pinning it against a tree.

The vehicles quickly caught fire. The driver of the tractor-trailer managed to escape, but the pickup truck driver wasn&#x2019;t so lucky. <a href="http://www.wlwt.com/news/fatal-truck-crash-under-investigation-in-pendleton-county/37937954">WLWT reported</a>, &#x201C;[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][Fire Chief David Marquardt] said passersby tried to help the pickup driver but were unsuccessful. &#x2018;They had pry bars and stuff. Actually the homeowner, he tripped over the barbed wire fence. He actually has scrapes and tears on his clothes from where he tried to get to the vehicle to help the subject out.&quot;

While the cause remains under investigation, long-time resident Paul Pfanstiel told <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/kenton-county/fatal-crash-shuts-down-ky17-in-southern-kenton-county">WCPO 9</a> that there was ice on the road that morning. In addition, he said the sharp curves on Madison Pike are dangerous. &#x201C;When they come around that curve, they don&#x2019;t have no control,&#x201D; Pfanstiel said.
<h2>Big rigs are a force to be reckoned with</h2>
This deadly accident highlights the dangers of sharing the road with big trucks. Even in ideal driving conditions, an accident with a tractor-trailer can be fatal. A fully loaded tractor-trailer can weigh up to 80,000 lbs. Passenger vehicles, which may weight only 2,000 lbs, don&#x2019;t stand a chance in a collision with a tractor-trailer.

Passersby were horrified by the fiery accident, which shut down the highway for most of the day. The Kentucky State Police are working to determine how the accident happened, though there is little doubt that poor conditions and the sharp curve were contributing factors. In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers are with the family of 28-year-old David Erskine, who was lost in the accident.

Tractor-trailers are a significant threat to others on the road. Defensive driving and reasonable caution only go so far. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight every day to protect the rights of accident victims and get them the compensation they deserve.

Six days later, the company issued a voluntary recall of all packaged products produced there. The next day, the US Food and Drug Administration confirmed the presence of the pathogen <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> at the processing facility.

The contamination resulted in a small but widespread outbreak of listeriosis. According to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/bagged-salads-01-16/">Centers For Disease Control &amp; Prevention</a>, the first case was reported in July of last year. Investigators began hunting for the source of the infection in September 2015, but were unable to confirm a contamination until January 2016. As of February 25, eighteen people in the US had been hospitalized for the disease. One man, a Michigan native, died.

The outbreak is not unique to the U.S. <a href="http://www.thepacker.com/news/ohio-woman-files-lawsuit-dole-listeria-outbreak">The Packer</a> reported &#x201C;The Public Health Agency of Canada has recorded 11 illnesses, including three possible deaths, in five provinces it linked to the same listeria outbreak.&#xA0;Test results in the three deaths are not yet conclusive, the Canadian health agency reported.&#x201D;

It is perhaps worth noting that we wrote about a listeriosis outbreak around the same time last year that was also a result of salad greens contamination. The bacterium is not typically found in the wild; products are usually contaminated during processing. We&#x2019;re not saying that the cycle of contamination is linked to the time of year, but it is worth it to start looking at the news more closely during this time of the year as a preventative measure.
<h2>When quality control fails, people suffer</h2>
The dangers have spread to our corner of the world as well. An Ohio woman, Kiki Christofield, 77, purchased a salad mix packaged at the Springfield plant around January 20, just as that facility halted operations on suspicion of contamination. Christofield felt unwell and was taken by ambulance to the hospital just one day before the recall was issued. Doctors released her, unaware of the potential bacterial infection. Just five days later, her health had deteriorated so quickly that she became comatose, and remains so as of this writing.

Christofield&#x2019;s daughter, Constance Georgostathis, filed suit against Dole in early March. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Kiki Christofield. Facing the loss of a family member is never easy, and the emotional toll is compounded by the financial realities of constant medical care.

Hospitals give it to patients who are undergoing surgical procedures. Doctors prescribe it for people who live in chronic pain. It literally changes ho your body responds to pain signals form the brain. In some ways, it is a miracle drug.

But it also has a very high rate of dependency, and can lead to a number of serious side effects, including fatal respiratory depression. When doctors fail to monitor their patients who have been given Dilaudid, or mistake Dilaudid for morphine &#x2013; a common prescription error &#x2013; they run the risk of their patients dying from an overdose that could have been avoided or &#x201C;fixed&#x201D; through proper care. And so Dilaudid becomes not a cure for pain, but a pathway to potential fatalities.
<h2>What the number say</h2>
Much research has been done over the last few decades regarding the risks of an overdose. As our own Marc Pera points out in his article for the Ohio Association of Justice, &#x201C;the Joint Commission stated that of the studied opioid related adverse drug events, 47% were wrong dose errors and 29% were improper monitoring.&#x201D; In most cases, these dosage errors are caused by confusing hydromorphone with morphine. According to one 2010 study by the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Advisory, &#x201C;analysis of wrong drug medication errors mentioning HYDROmorphone reveals that <strong>70% involve mix-ups</strong> with morphine&#x201D; (emphasis ours).

While any mix-up is dangerous, this one is especially so. Dilaudid is about seven times stronger than morphine. If a doctor means to prescribe an initial dose of 10mg of morphine to a recovering surgical patient, and that patient receives 10mgs of hydromorphone instead, it is virtually guaranteed the patient will overdose on the drug. This overdose can lead to permanent brain damage, to respiratory depression or to death.
<h2>Each symptom can lead into the next</h2>
If a patient is overdosed on Dilaudid and goes into respiratory depression, his or her respiratory rates can decrease, and less oxygen will be available in his or her blood. There is also a risk of increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, too. Oxygen deprivation can lead to brain damage or to death, depending on how long the patient is deprived.

If a patient is being properly monitored by doctors or nursing staff, the signs of respiratory depression will be readily apparent. With prompt and effective treatment, the patient can be saved. However, because the signs of respiratory depression can be (and often are) mistaken for sleep, many medical professionals do not reach the patient in time to stop any damage from occurring. A cursory look at a patient may not reveal the signs, which is why a continuous pulse oximeter should be used for at least four hours after the dose is administered, and medical staff should check on patients&#x2019; breathing patterns, chest movement and lungs consistently and frequently.

Dilaudid overdoses can be avoided if doctors take the time to care for their patients. Any percentage of drug mix-ups is too high, but 70% is almost too high to believe. It is time medical professionals to start taking responsibility for their roles in creating this problem, and to be held accountable for it.

The accidents have caused road closures and created hazardous conditions for other motorists and first responders.

One tractor-trailer was carrying propane when it wrecked on US 250, just one day after a water truck crashed in Marshall County. Propane leaked during the accident, resulting in a number of residents being forced to evacuate the area. A third accident, just days later, spilled hydrochloric acid, resulting in hours of delays for school buses and other motorists.
<h2>Big business means more trucks on the road</h2>
The accidents are taking a toll on Ohio and West Virginia residents alike. The increased activity resulting from the Marcellus and Utica Shale drilling operations may be good for the economy, but it&#x2019;s creating dangerous conditions for drivers in both states. Mostly, the increased output means that more trucks are required to transport materials. More big rigs on the road means more risk.

Neffs Fire Department Chief, Mike Knowlton, told the <a href="http://www.theintelligencer.net/page/content.detail/id/653073/Truck-Accidents-Keep-Ohio-Valley---.html">Intelligencer Wheeling News Register</a> that many of the accidents are the result of drivers&#x2019; unfamiliarity with Ohio and West Virginia roads. He said, &#x201C;So many of the companies are from Texas. They aren&#x2019;t used to roads with dips and sharp turns.&#x201D;

Big rigs, by their very nature, are difficult to turn and stop. They can weigh in excess of 80,000 lbs and represent a significant amount of force on the road. When inexperienced drivers meet challenging conditions, the combination often spells disaster. While the accidents so far have mostly inconvenienced drivers, it&#x2019;s only a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt.
<h2>Some accidents are unavoidable</h2>
Defensive driving only goes so far. Accidents involving big rigs are often fatal. In 2014, the last year for which information is available, commercial trucks were responsible for 161 deaths and more than 7,000 injuries according to the <a href="http://www.publicsafety.ohio.gov/links/2014CrashFacts.pdf">Ohio Department of Public Safety</a>.

When big trucks are on the road, awareness and precaution is key. Even the best drivers, however, are unable to avoid every obstacle. If you or someone you know has been injured in a commercial truck accident, you may be entitled to compensation.

The results, which went live on March 14, were quickly hyped to an absurd degree. As of this writing, more than 450 articles have been written about the dangerous failure in response that the study uncovered.
<h2>About the study</h2>
Researchers used 68 phones from 7 manufacturers, and tested the responses of the four main conversation agents, including Siri, Cortana, Google Now, and S Voice. Each device was asked the same 9 questions in natural language, and each question was repeated until there were no new answers.

The various devices ran a total of 77 different versions of the four main conversation agents. Each version was asked a series of nine questions. Of these, 3 each concerned mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health. The study graded the responses based on the agent&#x2019;s ability to understand, respond, or refer the user to a specific and useful resource. The team found that no single agent performed well across the board.

The <a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2500043">study concludes</a>, &#x201C;When asked simple questions about mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health, Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and S Voice responded inconsistently and incompletely. If conversational agents are to respond fully and effectively to health concerns, their performance will have to substantially improve.&#x201D;
<h2>About the conclusion</h2>
Journalists used this conclusion to critique smartphone manufacturers and software programmers, but it seems that they missed the point. Conversation agents are not designed to provide professional advice or support; that is why they are called &#x201C;conversation agents&#x201D; and not &#x201C;emergency and expert referral agents.&#x201D;

While it might behoove manufacturers to build in a certain level of sensitivity, conversation agents are not designed or required to help in an emergency or offer authoritative advice. They can recognize your name, but not the difference between &#x201C;Serengeti&#x201D; and &#x201C;spaghetti&#x201D; (for the record, one is a desert, and the other is delicious). Ultimately, smartphones add convenience, but cannot supplant experience.

The bottom line? When you have questions, it makes sense to ask a real person, an expert in the field. There is no doubt whatsoever that our lives are made better in innumerable ways by technology, but there is no substitute for expert help when you need it. We teach our children to call 911 in an emergency and visit a doctor when they are sick. Legal advice is no different; when you need help, don&#x2019;t ask the internet; call an expert.

The Combs-Hehl Bridge rises over a hundred feet above the Ohio River. The major artery that connects Ohio and Kentucky, the bridge has had its fair share of accidents, but the most recent one was horrifying. A devastating March 15 pileup sent one car plunging into the river below. Police now think they know the identity of the driver, though strong currents have so far thwarted recovery efforts.
<h2>How did the car get off the bridge?</h2>
Accident reconstructions take a considerable amount of time. With an accident this complicated, it could be up to year before the ultimate cause is known. Eyewitness accounts report four distinct accidents that created a chain reaction. Drivers behind the accidents were traveling at highway speed, and created additional obstacles while trying to maneuver through the wrecks.

The driver that went off the bridge was attempting to weave through the accidents. <a href="http://www.fox19.com/story/31477293/rescue-underway-after-car-plunges-into-water-near-combs-hehl-bridge">Fox 19 Now</a> reported, &#x201C;The vehicle was about halfway across the bridge when it was involved in another crash, fell over the side and plunged into the river below.

He said the car clipped a semi-truck, then hit the side of the wall [and went over the bridge].&#x201D; Campbell County Police Chief Craig Sorrell said there were 4 different accidents that occurred, creating the chain reaction.

The Louisville office of the Ohio Coast Guard shut river traffic down in both directions after the crash, reopening it on Wednesday, March 16.
<h2>Collisions with big trucks have big consequences</h2>
It could very well have been the last collision that sent the unidentified man to his death in the river below. Colliding with a tractor-trailer is nothing like colliding with another passenger vehicle. Trucks are so massive that the force of a collision is felt almost entirely by the smaller vehicle.

The complexities of such accidents increase when there are multiple cars involved. A case like this, where the accident happened on a bridge spanning Kentucky and Ohio, will be more so. Kentucky is a pure comparative fault state, so the percentage of an award a driver can obtain will be affected by the percentage of fault he or she shares in contributing to his or her own injuries. Ohio, on the other hand, will not allow a plaintiff to recover if he or she is 51% at fault of the accident. Two different jurisdictions, two different statutes, and four different accidents means one very difficult situation for everyone involved.

When tractor-trailers are involved in accidents, the results are almost always fatal to other drivers. In this case, the effects were beyond imagining. Big trucks cause big accidents, and when a loved one is lost, families and friends are affected forever. We extend our deepest condolences to the friends and family of the unknown driver.

During the hearing, Miller made headlines by publicly acknowledging that there is a link between football and the devastating neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.

This is the first time that any representative of the NFL has acknowledged a definitive link between the sport and the disease, though research has effectively proven that repetitive cranial trauma is the most likely cause. The admission is all the more surprising because of the timing; just last month, Dr. Mitch Berger, a member of the league&#x2019;s head, neck and spine committee, publicly disavowed that a link existed.

This abrupt reversal in policy has many asking questions, including four former players who are appealing the terms of a court settlement for players who developed the disease. There is speculation that the league&#x2019;s shift in position could change the outcome of the appeal. Mostly, however, there is a general feeling that the statement is overdue.

Chris Nowinski, executive director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, believes that Miller&#x2019;s statement was a milestone moment. He told the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-nfl-cte-jeff-miller-20160314-story.html">Los Angeles Times</a>, &#x201C;The NFL spent years trying to convince the public that a link hasn&apos;t been established. We now need to tell them, &apos;The NFL believes there&apos;s a link. And if the NFL believes there&apos;s a link, you should believe there&apos;s a link, because they&apos;re the last people that want to believe there&apos;s a link.&apos;&#x201D;
<h2>The real problem</h2>
Nowinski believes that Miller&#x2019;s acknowledgment should change the conversation about football and CTE. He believes that professional athletes are aware of the injuries they can incur and can make an informed choice about whether to continue playing. He believes that the focus should now be on the millions of children that play football across the country who are exposed to CTE from as early as 5 years old.

This is the information and acknowledgment that we need to move forward. We couldn&#x2019;t agree more with Mr. Nowinski&#x2019;s assessment; our focus needs to be on the safety of our children and their futures. It is absolutely essential that this message reaches parents everywhere; football can cause CTE, and our children are at risk.

The downed poles and wires created dangerous conditions that were exacerbated by high winds and heavy rainfall. The driver, Adam Plaxco, 36, was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle while impaired (OVI) and failure to maintain control of a motor vehicle.
<h2>DWI, DUI, and OVI: What is the difference?</h2>
In Ohio, OVI is an umbrella term for operating a vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol. A DUI or DWI is applied to drivers operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Depending on the level of impairment, offenders face stiff penalties including license suspension, expensive fines and even jail time.

Plaxco&#x2019;s negligence in operating his truck under the influence of alcohol placed first responders in harms way and created major problems for Friday&#x2019;s commuters. <a href="http://wkbn.com/2016/03/24/crash-involving-semi-in-hubbard-closes-portion-of-route-62/">WKBN 27</a> reported that the Route 62 interchanges remained blocked for more than 18 hours, causing a massive disruption in traffic. Thankfully, no one was injured during the accident or the resulting cleanup.

The incident is a graphic illustration of the force that big rigs represent. Even at low speed, the truck was able to snap massive utility poles like toothpicks. This relatively minor incident was enough to shut down a major highway interchange for more than two days.
<h2>Big rigs create dangerous conditions</h2>
We have written about the threats that tractor-trailers pose to other motorists, but we cannot say it enough; big trucks cause big damage. Something as simple as a tire blowout can be fatal to other drivers. Even when other cars are not involved, truck accident debris can create dangerous driving conditions and cause lasting damage to local areas. Unfortunately, precaution isn&#x2019;t enough to avoid an accident.

When you or a loved one is involved in commercial truck accident, the effects can be devastating. Big collisions are often fatal, and even when they are not, serious injuries are common. If you or a loved sustained injuries in an accident, you may be entitled to compensation for your medical bills and lost wages. The experienced Ohio commercial truck accident lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation.

In 2004, Mullins and his company paid a total of $500,000 in fines for violating the Clean Air Act; the fines were assessed after Mullins pled guilty to misreporting air pollution from a volatile organic compound called TCE.

<a href="http://www.whio.com/news/news/vapor-intrusion-in-riverside-neighborhood-traced-t/nqcf2/">WHIO reported</a> that early this year the US EPA, at the behest of the Ohio EPA, concluded a three-year investigation into groundwater and soil contamination with the carcinogenic compounds known as PCE and TCE. After sampling more than 470 residential properties and a concerted investigative effort, the EPA announced that Mullins Rubber Products &amp; Mullins Land Co. were the definitive source of the contamination that directly caused high levels of indoor air pollution in nearby Valley Pike.
<h2>How environmental contamination threatens homes and families</h2>
The indoor air pollution was the result of the toxic compounds rising out of the soil. This natural evaporation created a condition called &#x201C;vapor intrusion&#x201D; in more than 90 homes in the Valley Pike neighborhood of Riverside. The vapor intrusion led to dangerous levels of the now airborne compounds in the affected homes, and required the installation of vapor abatement systems to purify the indoor air. Continuous monitoring will be required to ensure the safety of residents for years to come.

According to the <a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=14&amp;po=10">Agency for Toxic Substances &amp; Disease Registry</a>, the chemicals PCE and TCE (tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene, respectively) are known to be extremely dangerous to humans. Worse, the chemicals are extraordinarily difficult to remove from water supplies, and stick around for years. PCE degrades into TCE, meaning that even natural decomposition doesn&#x2019;t reduce toxicity. Acute exposure at moderate levels in air or water causes skin and mucous irritation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. At high levels, the nervous system is affected, and confusion and loss of coordination precede unconsciousness, heart arrhythmia and pulmonary edema.

Nor is that all; a 2014 <a href="http://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-069X-13-72">study</a> published in the journal <em>Environmental Health </em>examined the effects of PCE contaminated drinking water on pregnant women. The results showed that prenatal exposure to PCE increased the risk of stillbirth by 2.38 times, and increased the risk of a placental abruption by 1.35 times. A placental abruption occurs when the placenta prematurely separates from the uterine wall, and interrupts the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the baby. Placental abruptions drastically increase the chance of birth injury due to hypoxia.
<h2>Missing details are worthy of note</h2>
Interestingly, the EPA investigation makes no note of the fact that Mullins&#x2019; company was awarded a $53,000 Economic Development/Government Equity grant in 2012 from Montgomery County. The grant was a bailout; according to the Dayton Daily News, the grant was necessary to purchase a chiller, a vital part of the manufacturing process, because &#x201C;Mullins said the company had been using a well the last 60 years, but <strong>the water became contaminated</strong> [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][emphasis added] and had to be shut down.&#x201D;

This article was published just one year prior to the Ohio EPA&#x2019;s discovery of the Valley Pike contamination. The issue may have been discovered sooner, but the agency only conducts VOC testing in groundwater and wells every 18 months because of the vast number of sites around the state. Whether Mullins&#x2019; failed to report the cooling well contamination in 2012, and whether that incident was the proximal cause of the vapor intrusion remains to be seen.

While the contamination was possibly accidental (Mullins <a href="http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/local/epa-continues-investigation-of-vapor-intrusion-in-/ncKdw/?icmp=daytondaily_internallink_textlink_apr2013_daytondailystubtomydaytondaily_launch">said in December 2013</a> he was 100 percent confident that his company was not the source), the repercussions are very real. The Ohio EPA and the US EPA are evaluating the area for proposal to the National Priorities List (aka, Superfund), and Mullins &amp; Co. have agreed to an Administrative Order on Consent that defines the companies&#x2019; responsibilities regarding sampling and cleanup.
<h2>Valley Pike could contaminate Dayton&#x2019;s public water system</h2>
While efforts are ongoing, there is no telling how big and bad the problem is for now. The <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/epa-closes-in-on-source-of-polluted-local-groundwa/nm3mw/">Dayton Daily News</a> reported, &#x201C;The plume is far from the city of Dayton&#x2019;s wellfields, and the goal is to intercept it, said Renninger, who is part of the EPA&#x2019;s Superfund Division. The fields are northwest and southeast of the plume.&#x201D; Good plan &#x2013; but if it doesn&#x2019;t work, the public drinking water supply could be tainted with carcinogenic compounds for years to come.

If your home has been affected, the EPA will install a vapor abatement system at no charge to you. If you or a loved one has experienced any of the symptoms of PCE or TCE exposure, or your pregnancy suffered complications, you may be entitled to compensation.

As our population grows, more and more cars are driving on highways and bridges that were never designed to handle such volume. New construction projects to address the volume and flow of traffic are necessary, but the threats to motorists that these projects pose are a growing problem.
<h2>Construction accidents can lead to even more accidents</h2>
A recent accident in Wood County was a perfect illustration of this situation. <a href="http://www.13abc.com/home/headlines/Accident-blocks-left-lane-of-I-75-SB-near--373577251.html">ABC 13</a> reported, &#x201C;Traffic is back to normal on I-75 SB between Middleton Pike and Dowling Rd. in Wood County after a crash involving a commercial vehicle and at least one car caused a serious back-up on Friday afternoon.&#x201D; The crash caused bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours, creating the potential for low-speed collisions (which can have serious consequences, despite the low speed) common in heavy traffic.

Construction zones pose a wide variety of threats to motorists. Sudden lane shifts or closures, heavy machinery, the unexpected presence of a person standing on a busy highway; every one of these situations can cause a major accident in a moment of distraction. Even when a driver is alert and engaged, poorly marked or confusing instructions can have devastating consequences at highway speeds.
<h2>Construction zone accidents by the numbers</h2>
Thankfully, construction zone accidents are rarely fatal because of the accompanying speed restrictions, but almost a third involve some form of injury, and more than two-thirds resulted in significant vehicle damage. The US Department of Transportation maintains a <a href="http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/resources/facts_stats/injuries_fatalities.htm">Work Zone Management Program</a> that keeps a record of this information, and includes statistical analyses. The most recent statistics available tell us that:
<ul>
    <li>There were 87,606 crashes in work zones in 2010</li>
    <li>41% of work zone crashes were rear-end collisions</li>
    <li>25% of work zone motor vehicle fatalities involvement large trucks, compared to 12% of all highway fatalities</li>
</ul>
Work zones create the perfect storm of poor driving conditions; changes in speed and direction coupled with unexpected activity require that hundreds of drivers give their full attention to the road. As we can see from the numbers, that is not a tenable situation.

If you have been involved in an accident and believe that a road repair contractor or municipal agency shared fault, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries and property damage. Unfortunately, proving that fault can be complicated, and requires experienced legal counsel. The experienced Ohio work zone accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation.

The scene was pure chaos; an overturned pickup truck was leaking gas on to the roadway, a short distance from a nearly unrecognizable Nissan Maxima and a driverless 18-wheeler. A passerby was helping to extricate three adults and a child from the pickup truck, but nothing could be done to help the two occupants of the small car.

Kentucky State Police Commercial Vehicle Enforcement worked to reconstruct the accident. Through investigation, officers found that the big rig was traveling north on US 119 when it crossed the centerline. The 18-wheeler sideswiped and overturned the pickup truck, then continued on a short distance before striking the Nissan Maxima. The occupants of the car, Lavondia Hensley, 31, and James Miracle, 64, were killed instantly.
<h2>He ran but couldn&#x2019;t hide</h2>
Officers found the driver of the 18-wheeler, Anthony Wayne Brewer, 42, of Pennington Gap, VA, a short time later. Brewer had checked into the Harlan ARH Hospital with injuries consistent with the accident. CVE Public Affairs Office Steven Douglas told the Harlan Daily Enterprise, &#x201C;Blood samples were obtained and Brewer was arrested and lodged in the Bell County Detention Center on charges of leaving the scene of an accident and operating on suspended/revoked Commercial Driver&#x2019;s License.&#x201D;

Lemar Trucking Company, the owner of the big rig, has been in business for 25 years; somehow, they allowed Brewer to operate a company truck on a suspended license. It was an egregious oversight with fatal consequences. How this happened remains to be seen, but two people are dead and four more were injured at the hands of a man who should not have been in the driver&#x2019;s seat.
<h2>History repeats itself</h2>
A quick web search reveals that Brewer behaved similarly in the past. Charges against Brewer from 2008 include operating a vehicle under the influence, failure to maintain insurance, improper registration, fleeing police on foot, and resisting arrest, to name just a few. How anyone could allow this man behind the wheel of a commercial truck defies belief.

In the hands of competent operators, big rigs pose a risk to other drivers on the road by dint of their sheer size. In the hands of incompetent operators, people die. The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Crandall &amp; Pera Law are with the families of Lavondia Hensley and James Miracle for the tragic loss they have suffered. It is our sincerest hope that justice will be served and Brewer will be held accountable for his actions.

In the worst-case scenarios, this can absolutely happen. But many people who suffer what is deemed a mild traumatic brain injury can eventually heal; it just takes a while to determine whether that healing will be complete or not. These types of events are more common in athletes who play impact sports, though they can happen to anyone.

This is why &#x201C;a group of anesthesiology, neurosurgery and internal medicine doctors&#x201D; has created a device that, when &#x201C;worn around the neck may reduce injuries from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) during athletic events. The device reduces the brain&#x2019;s movement inside the skull after a collision,&#x201D; according to <a href="http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/Technology/Article/04-16/New-Device-Aims-To-Reduce-Mild-Traumatic-Brain-Injury-In-Sports-and-the-Military/35836">Anesthesiology News</a>.
<h2>How it works</h2>
It is a simple-looking piece of technology; the prototype is a collar that decreases the amount of blood flow from the cranium into the jugular. This results in the cranium containing a higher volume of blood. That higher volume means that when a person is hit in the head, his or her brain does not move a lot within the skull &#x2013; and it is that movement, that &#x201C;sloshing,&#x201D; as one doctor puts it, which is doing the most damage in cases of mild TBIs.
<h2>Is it available yet?</h2>
No, not yet. But the group has started its clinical human trials in the Cincinnati Children&#x2019;s Hospital Medical Center. Two full manuscripts have been submitted, looking at hockey and football players and the types of injuries they receive. Based on this data, the group is moving forward with its trials. The neckband should be available for use by the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017, depending, one assumes, on the outcome of the trials.

The short and long-term effects of a traumatic brain injury are often as unique as the people who suffer with them. New science and research comes forward every day about the effects of head injuries and their correlation to CTE. This new project aims smaller, but the impact could be wider than we anticipate. After all, if a person who suffers &#x201C;mild&#x201D; brain injuries repeatedly could develop the same complications and side effects over time as a person who suffers one TBI, then this new collar could offer much greater protection. It also allows kids and adults to continue playing the sports and games they love in a safer way. We certainly hope that it does.

The three 14,580-pound steel coils chained to [truck driver Renato] Velazquez&#x2019;s trailer bed burst their restraints. One of the massive rolls struck the cab of the Tollway [towing] vehicle, instantly killing its 39-year-old driver Vincent Petrella and injuring Agron Xhelaj, the driver of the stalled truck who was seated beside him&#x201D; (emphasis ours).

Mr. Valasquez hit the trooper&#x2019;s car at 63 miles per hour. The exploding gas tank literally <em>set Mr. Balder on fire</em>. He suffered burns on a third of his body. Doctors had to put him in a medically induced coma. He&#x2019;s still in rehab, after 10 surgeries and three months in the hospital.

If it seems like we are really hammering this home, it is because of this: we want you to see the horrific impact of a truck accident with a fatigued driver. We want you to understand, truly understand, why drowsy driving is so dangerous. And we want you to know that the reason you have seen and heard about and read an increasing number of stories about this topic is because Congress has taken steps over the last few years to modify truck safety regulations put in place to stop these types of horrific accidents.
<h2>The trucking industry is lobbying for changes that suit them, not you</h2>
Right now, a tractor-trailer can only haul up to 80,000lbs, per the federal limit. Trailers max out at 28 feet in length. Truck drivers can only work 70 hours a week. The youngest commercial truck drivers are 21 years old. Insurance requirements are high, and reports about the safety of trucking companies are all open to the public.

For now. <em>These</em> are the regulations that lobbyists are trying to change, and Congress is slowly but surely giving in to them. When the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration changed the rules about how long a truck driver could be on the road, lobbyists almost convinced Congress to overturn the rule. They convinced a Maine Senator to add a provision to a transportation bill that &#x201C;temporarily barr[ed] FMCSA from spending any money to enforce its new rule and requiring additional study of the issue to a $54 billion transportation bill during an untelevised legislative markup in June 2014.&#x201D; The news of the Tracy Morgan crash put an end to it, but that same Senator found a way to slip it back in under another bill.

Truck driver fatigue is a very real problem, and the numbers of crashes caused by drivers asleep at the wheel is increasing. As long as Congress allows lobbyists from the trucking industry to dictate safety regulations, we are all at risk &#x2013; truck drivers too &#x2013; of being seriously injured by a distracted or fatigued driver.

If you sustained an injury in a crash with a truck driver in Ohio or Kentucky, Crandall &amp; Pera Law want to hear your story. Our killed truck accident lawyers have the resources and experience to handle complex injury claims.

Everyone is itching to get outside and get moving; there are leaves to rake and lawns to mow, bicycles to pull out of the garage, and work to do before we play in the great outdoors. Before you get too excited at the prospect of all that time outside, take a minute to get your head in the game; every season has its hazards, but spring makes us particularly reckless because we&#x2019;ve been locked away all the long dark winter.
<h2>Tools and toys to avoid</h2>
<a href="http://news.health.com/2016/03/03/8-things-er-doctors-refuse-to-have-in-their-homes/">Health.com</a> recently published a list of 8 things emergency room doctors refuse to have in their houses. While not all of them apply here, three big-ticket items are a major concern. Take a minute to consider the dangers before dusting off these tools and toys:

&#xA0;
<ul>
    <li><strong>Trampolines</strong>. While having the neighborhood&#x2019;s largest trampoline might be cool, ER doctors don&#x2019;t buy them for their kids. Dr. Ferdinando Mirarchi, medical director the emergency room at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said, &#x201C;They&#x2019;re all trouble. There&#x2019;s no good kind.&#x201D;</li>
    <li><strong>Swimming pools</strong>. Even if your children know how to swim, accidents can happen. Having a pool installed is expensive, and there&#x2019;s a very good reason why your homeowner&#x2019;s insurance is higher when you own one. Dr. Dara Kass, of the NYU Langone Medical Center said, &#x201C;Unfortunately, every summer we see kids- even ones who can swim- accidentally fall into a pool and drown. For me, it is the fact that drowning occurs so fast, and often silently, that prevents me from ever wanting one at my house.&#x201D;</li>
    <li><strong>Power washers and extension ladders</strong>. While the first two items on this list are fun for kids and adults, power tools and tall ladders should be firmly in the realm of adults. Falls from tall ladders carry obvious risks, but emergency room Dr. Seth Podolsky said, &#x201C;The&#xA0;surprising thing&#xA0;I won&#x2019;t own&#xA0;is&#xA0;a power washer. People&#xA0;end up with&#xA0;penetrating injuries or lacerations from their intense water stream.&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Being safe does not come at the expense of fun</h2>
For each of these items, the risks they pose are disproportionate to the rewards they bring. Trampolines should be avoided at all costs, even when arguments ensue. If you have a pool, make sure safety railings and ladders are installed and locked when it is not in use. As for the power tools, there is no shame in hiring a trained professional to do dangerous work on your home.

The only states that ranked worse included Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas and West Virginia. That shouldn&#x2019;t make anyone feel better, however. Ohio is a first-rate state in first-world country, but ranks <em>behind </em>Russia, Serbia and Cuba in infant mortality. Clearly, something is very wrong.
<h2>The scope of the issue</h2>
The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> published final data for 2013 in a February edition of the National Vital Statistics Report. According to that report, about 1,000 infants die each year in Ohio because of birth complications. The deaths aren&#x2019;t spread evenly around the state; Southwest Ohio is has a higher rate of infant mortality, and the deaths are disproportionately greater in low-income communities.

According to <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/17/politics-stymies-one-way-save-infants/82418722/">Cincinnati.com</a>, &#x201C;The numbers are shocking and &#x2018;unacceptably high,&#x2019; said Rep.&#xA0;Stephanie Kunze,&#xA0;R-Hilliard.&#xA0;Ohio&apos;s state-run, low-income health insurance,&#xA0;Medicaid, pays for more than half of all births, and those babies are more likely to be premature and have a low birth weight.&#x201D;

Low-income mothers on Medicaid often receive poorer care, and multiple successive births increase the risk of premature delivery, which in turn increases the risk of complications, injuries, and birth defects. All of these factors contribute to Ohio&#x2019;s poor infant mortality rate, but there is one possible solution.
<h2>A free solution</h2>
Medicaid will pay for a contraceptive implant. The implants, known as long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), can prevent unplanned pregnancy or help to increase the time between deliveries. Unfortunately, not all hospitals offer the option on moral grounds, and most women are unaware that Medicaid will pay for the implant in full thanks to Obamacare.

Lawmakers in Ohio are as divided on the issue as the rest of the country. Senator Shannon Jones, R-Clearcreek Township, wants to change the way Medicaid reimburses healthcare organizations for contraceptives. However, whether her proposed legislation will see the light of day is another matter entirely.

From the same article, &#x201C;...contraception is a political hot potato, especially among Jones&apos; fellow Republicans.&#xA0;Some believe&#xA0;abstinence is the only effective and moral form of birth control. Others&#xA0;don&#x2019;t want to pay for contraception that would allow people to have sex outside of marriage. And the Catholic Church&#xA0;opposes any form of contraception, period. &#x2018;This isn&#x2019;t an easy topic to talk about,&#x2019; Jones said of LARC. &#x2018;I just don&#x2019;t think they know about it. Some of these topics are seen as taboo.&#x2019;

Whatever your position on the issue, it can no longer be taboo to discuss. Families are being affected forever because of birth injuries and complications, and the state of infant care in Ohio is a topic that must be addressed as soon as possible. Birth complications change lives, and not for the better.

If you or a loved one suffered complications during birth, you may be entitled to compensation for injuries your or your baby sustained. The experienced Ohio birth injury lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the confirmation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">Contact us</a> today for a free consultation.

We understand that in order to change the paths for the injured clients we represent, we need to be leaders &#x2013; not just for ourselves and our clients, but for community as a whole. Founding partner Steve Crandall recently presented at the 2016 annual convention for the Ohio Association for Justice (OAJ), conducting focus groups on the issues that affect trial lawyers on a day-to-day basis. The presentation, titled &#x201C;A Focus Group Review: The Winning Formula for Plaintiffs Lawyers,&#x201D; examined three specific interests to trial attorneys: jury selection, trial preparedness and marketing.

Steve, along with Jury Consultant Becky Jones from Smith-Jones Consulting, conducted several focus groups to ascertain information from these potential jurors regarding various areas of Plaintiff&#x2019;s lawyers practice. These included how a potential client would research and select a lawyer, what their thoughts and feelings are about various types of cases and specific information on jury selection. Steve Crandall also researched the most recent state and national trends in medical negligence, birth injury, wrongful death and anesthesia and failure to diagnose cases.
<h2>Honoring commitment</h2>
On top of all of Steve&#x2019;s hard work for the OAJ, he was also presented with a President&#x2019;s Award during the dinner on Saturday night. The President&#x2019;s Award is given to attorneys who help promote the goals and the mission of the OAJ, and who contribute to the community in a meaningful and substantial way.

All of us at Crandall &amp; Pera Law want to congratulate Steve Crandall on his successful presentation and on his award. He works hard at what he does; it&#x2019;s what makes him a real leader.

Great job, Steve &#x2013; you deserve it!

Accordingly, his license was revoked, though this apparently was not enough to keep Mr. Clouse off the road. On April 13, Clouse got behind the wheel; while the circumstances of his activity that day remain under investigation, the result stands clear at the Ohio Highway Patrol post in Erie.
<h2>Driver injured, but others unscathed</h2>
According to the <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/Police-Fire/2016/04/14/Castalia-driver-hurt-as-car-slams-into-ohio-state-highway-patrol-post.html">Toledo Blade</a>, &#x201C;...

The driver over-corrected, causing the vehicle to drive back on the road and then off its left side and across the lawn of the [Ohio Highway] patrol post, striking a concrete sign and crashing into the front of the building, troopers said. The impact of the crash damaged the walls and windows of the conference room, which was not occupied after a public meeting was adjourned an hour earlier, according to the patrol.&#x201D;

Security cameras <a href="http://fox8.com/2016/04/15/surveillance-video-captures-moment-accused-drunk-driver-crashed-into-ohsp-post/">captured</a> the accident on video, though the destruction was so extensive that the footage will likely be unnecessary when Clouse is tried. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to get car insurance unless you are legally able to operate a vehicle; in this case, it is safe to assume that Clouse did not have any insurance, and repairs for the damage he caused will have to be paid for some other way.
<h2>What if this happened to your house?</h2>
If a negligent driver strikes your property, the insurance they carry will pay for damages up to the policy limit, but no further. When the assessed damage is greater than the policy limit, or the driver was uninsured, your insurance steps in. Unfortunately, the process can be extremely complicated. It&#x2019;s always a good idea to retain experienced legal counsel when you have been injured and/or your property damaged by another&#x2019;s negligence.

Liability and responsibility for property damage or personal injury can be difficult to prove, and insurance companies can throw a great deal of time and money to prevent you from getting the money you are owed. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio car incursion lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

While on East I-275, he crashed his car into the back end of a Pontiac Grand Am. He sustained serious injuries; the driver of the Grand Am, Scott E. Petredis, died as a result. Lippmeier was drunk &#x2013; his BAC was almost two times the legal limit, according to the report in <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2016/05/13/osp-horseshoe-casino-over-served-driver-fatal-crash/84327862/">Cincinnati.com</a> &#x2013; and he now sits in the Hamilton County Jail, facing two charges of vehicular manslaughter.

He is not the only one facing charges. The Horseshoe Casino is also facing fines and the potential revocation of its liquor license by the Ohio Liquor Control Commission. Casino employees knowingly overserved Lippmeier, which makes the casino liable under Ohio&#x2019;s dram shop laws.
<h2>Why Ohio&#x2019;s dram shop laws are important</h2>
People who are drunk cannot make responsible decisions. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/10/16/what-alcohol-really-does-to-your-brain/#560e3df7413b">This is fact.</a> Alcohol affects how chemical messages are sent and received by your brain, while simultaneously increasing the release of dopamine: this is why, even though an intoxicated person&#x2019;s speech slurs and his or her movements become uncoordinated, that person feels invincible. Your brain cannot handle it.

To combat this, Ohio put its dram shop laws in place. If a patron is too drunk to be rational, the bartender or server is there to ensure that the drinker does not make a poor decision &#x2013; like getting into a fight, or grabbing the keys. By holding bars and restaurants liable, either &#x201C;<a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/ohio/2015/title-43/chapter-4399/section-4399.02/">severally or jointly&#x2026;for all damages sustained&#x201D;</a> in the event of an incident, the state can ensure that cooler heads will prevail.

Unfortunately, based on our own experiences, we know that this doesn&#x2019;t always work. Marc Pera in particular has handled some of the most complex dram shop cases our firm has had. He has seen first-hand the effects a drunk driver has on the lives of the people he or she hurts. He has fought against bars, restaurants and casinos who overserve their patrons &#x2013; and he has won those cases, every time. And still, no matter how hard he fights, we can&#x2019;t seem to get people in Ohio to stop overserving drunk patrons.
<h2>The cycle needs to end</h2>
We can rail against the dangers of drunk driving, and the senseless deaths cause by such selfish acts. We can beg people not to drink and drive, to not take the risk. But if casinos, bars and restaurants continue to serve their patrons even when it is clear that they are intoxicated, or with the knowledge that said bar patrons have been drinking for long enough that there is no way they couldn&#x2019;t be intoxicated, then the culpability falls on both parties: the selfish driver who grabbed his or her keys, and the bar that served the driver.

Our hearts go out to Scott Petredis&#x2019;s family, and we hope that, in time, they can find some measure of peace.

And despite the steps taken over the years to ensure a safety environment for the kids (the viciously hot metal slides and concrete pavers beneath the jungle gym are things of myth, now), it seems that children may still be at serious risk of serious injuries while they play.

The main concern? Traumatic brain injuries, according to the National center for Injury Prevention and control. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/children-suffering-traumatic-brain-injuries-playground-study/story?id=38813384">ABC News reports</a>:

&#x201C;Researchers from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control looked at injury rates for kids under 14 from 2005 to 2013 and determined that there was a significant increase in children going to the emergency room for traumatic brain injuries. Boys accounted for 58.6 percent of the TBIs identified while 50.6 percent of children with TBIs were between the ages of five and nine, according to a study published today in the Pediatrics Medical Journal.&#x201D;

Swings and monkey bars were named as the main contributors to these types of injuries.

However, the question remains &#x2013; are we seeing more TBIs being reported because the playgrounds themselves are inherently dangerous? Or is it, as speculated by the authors of the study, that kids are spending more time on playgrounds (meaning an increased chance of injury) and people are paying more attention to the signs and symptoms of brain injuries?
<h2>Common injuries from playground accidents</h2>
The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Playground-Injuries/playgroundinjuries-factsheet.htm">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> have other concerns besides traumatic brain injuries. According to their research, around 200,000 children will sustain an injury on a playground each year. Almost half of those injuries will be categorized as severe &#x2013; &#x201C;fractures, internal injuries, concussions, dislocations, and amputations,&#x201D; and the overwhelming majority (around 75%) will happen on public playgrounds.

Parents should be aware, however, that a number of children die each year from playground injuries &#x2013; and around 70% of those deaths will occur while the child is playing at home. Strangulation and falls are the leading cause of playground-related deaths.
<h2>Making playgrounds safe for kids</h2>
We may not be able to prevent every bump and bruise our children sustain during play, but we <em>can</em> make sure that their playgrounds and equipment are the safest available.
<ul>
    <li>Avoid rusty or broken equipment, and teach your children to do the same.</li>
    <li>Make sure your child is not wearing anything around his or her neck that could be caught on a piece of equipment; think scarves, drawstring hoodies, jewelry, even bike helmets.</li>
    <li>Install your own playground equipment over soft, non-toxic materials, like sand.</li>
    <li>Make sure your child uses the right sized swing for his or her age, weight and height.</li>
    <li>Never allow your child to use a playground unattended, and make sure that school and daycare staff members do the same.</li>
</ul>
Children will play, and sometimes they will get hurt in the process. But if your child sustains a serious injury because of defective equipment or while on dangerous, ill-kept playgrounds, you may have a claim for compensation. To find out more, please <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law </a>and schedule your consultation with an experienced products liability attorney in Ohio or Kentucky.

We recently heard a story about a new kind of MRI (magnetic resonance imagining) scan that led to a breakthrough for a woman with multiple sclerosis (MS), and helped alleviate some of her symptoms. The MRI was developed by the FONAR Corporation. Unlike a traditional MRI scan, which forces patients to lie down, the FONAR UPRIGHT&#xAE; MRI scans patients in a variety of positions: sitting, reclining, standing, bending, etc. <a href="http://www.fonar.com/standup.htm">This type of scan</a> &#x201C;allows all parts of the body to be imaged with the normal weight of your body on the spine and other joints,&#x201D; as opposed to creating images from only the recumbent position.

The MS patient was suffering from nausea and vertigo, even when she laid down. Her doctors, upon completing the scan with the UPRIGHT device, noticed that &#x201C;Misaligned cervical vertebrae in the patient (specifically, the vertebrae in the neck known as C-1, C-2, and C3) were causing blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid,&#x201D; according to a recent <a href="http://www.fonar.com/news/110211.htm">news release</a>. The fluid was then leaking into her brain, causing lesions. Doctors were able to realign the vertebrae, which allowed the CSF to move normally. As a result, &#x201C;the patient reported that her severe vertigo and vomiting in the recumbent (lying down) position had ceased and that her stumbling from unequal leg length had disappeared.&#x201D;
<h2>Fighting for a cure</h2>
MS is one of those particularly insidious diseases. The <a href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Definition-of-MS">National Multiple Sclerosis Society</a> describes it as an immune-mediated process, wherein a person&#x2019;s central nervous system attacks the nerve fibers and their fatty insulation (called myelin). This causes scarring, and disrupts the impulses that travel from the nerves to the brain, and vice versa. There is no cure for MS, and its symptoms can vary between patients.

Vertigo and gait problems, like those suffered by the woman we wrote about above, are two of the more common symptoms. Others include:
<ul>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Numbness</li>
    <li>Incontinence or constipation</li>
    <li>Spasticity</li>
    <li>Changes in vision</li>
    <li>Changes in mood, including depression</li>
    <li>Problems with cognitive function</li>
    <li>Sexual dysfunction</li>
    <li>Pain, either episodic or chronic</li>
</ul>
People diagnosed with MS face a world of uncertainty; how long will they live? How will their bodies betray them next? Can their symptoms be alleviated? When will the next relapse occur? While doctors are able to offer some treatments that may modify the course a person&#x2019;s disease will take (to varying degrees of success), the truth is that people with multiple sclerosis will most likely die from it.

That is what makes this story about the MRI scan such a silver lining. If we cannot cure the disease &#x2013; <em>yet</em> &#x2013; then at least we have a new tool in our arsenal for helping to lessen some of the more pervasive symptoms and effects, giving patients an opportunity to live a fuller life.

Cutting into the human body damages tissues, and one misstep can cause irreparable damage. Human surgery is one arena where machines have been unable to outperform humans, simply because of the intricacy and delicacy required.

Until now, robots have played the role of assistant in the operating room. The widely used da Vinci system uses human input to control precision robotics. The system was revolutionary when it was introduced; smaller and more precise incisions reduced healing time and infection risk. But to err is human, and surgeons are still very human.

Small errors, huge effects

A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/05/03/researchers-medical-errors-now-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-united-states/">recent study</a> in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> has confirmed that medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States, ranking just behind heart disease and cancer. Worse, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/04/27/looming-catastrophe-these-7-emergency-surgeries-account-for-80-percent-of-deaths-and-costs/">recent analysis</a> published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that just seven emergency surgical procedures accounted for around 80% of deaths and other factors related to emergency surgeries. All seven of the procedures involved abdominal surgery. In short, surgical errors contribute to a large part of healthcare associated deaths, and abdominal surgical errors have a very high fatality rate.

A new robot is in the works that would help to reduce medical and surgical errors, and the team behind the tech has just announced a major breakthrough. The Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot, or STAR, has successfully performed soft tissue surgery with minimal human interference. The system uses advanced imaging technology, force feedback sensors, and a highly precise mechanical arm to suture soft tissues.

STAR recently performed a procedure called anastomosis on a live pig. During the procedure, two severed pieces of intestine were stitched together. The results of STAR&#x2019;s procedure were compared to three other methods, all of which required a human hand to guide the suturing.
<h2>Docs oversee robot&#x2019;s first stitches</h2>
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/4/11591024/robot-surgery-autonomous-smart-tissue-star-system">The Verge</a> reported, &#x201C;Overall, the STAR robot produced stitches that were more evenly spaced than any of the other three methods. This is a good signifier of a suture&#x2019;s strength, said Axel Krieger, an assistant to the study, as inconsistent spacing leads to pressure points. These, in turn, lead to leaks.&#x201D; In addition to even spacing, the robot was able to react to changing circumstances and constantly moving flesh. Despite the success of the experiment, STAR isn&#x2019;t quite ready for the real world; more tests are needed in a great deal of different circumstances.

STAR represents great hope for our future, and the efforts behind the technology have the best of intentions. However, the present we live in is the one where medical errors are a leading cause of death and eight in ten abdominal surgeries result in death. Medical errors kill people and change families forever. When they do, we are here to help.

That number comes from a <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139">new study published in the BMJ</a>, which finds that only heart disease and cancer are more deadly than doctors in this country.

The lead researcher is Martin Makary, a professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/05/03/researchers-medical-errors-now-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-united-states/">Washington Post</a> &#x201C;that the category [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][of medical errors] includes everything from bad doctors to more systemic issues such as communication breakdowns when patients are handed off from one department to another;&#x201D; or, to put it even more succinctly, &#x201C;It boils down to people dying from the care that they receive rather than the disease for which they are seeking care.&quot;

If you need a minute to digest that last statement, we understand; it is a bitter pill to swallow. Doctors are supposed to make us well. Instead, it seems they&#x2019;re killing us &#x2013; literally &#x2013; through their negligence.
<h2>It could be even worse</h2>
It could be a LOT worse, in fact. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/03/health/medical-error-a-leading-cause-of-death/">CNN reports</a> that these estimates may be far lower than the real number, which does not include deaths that occur in nursing homes or personal homes, because death certificates are not asking for that information. &#x201C;Currently the cause of death listed on the certificate has to line up with an insurance billing code. Those codes do not adequately capture human error or system factors.&#x201D; In other words, is a patient goes into cardiac arrest and dies as a result of a doctor&#x2019;s mistake, the death certificate will only list &#x201C;cardiac arrest&#x201D; as the cause of death. There is no indication that an error played any role in that death at all.

Dr. Makary believes that hospitals do not understand the full scope of the issue, and that is why so little is being done to prevent these mistakes. He offers a few solutions to curb this problem:
<ol>
    <li>Fund more studies on medical errors to see the real scope of the issue.</li>
    <li>Invest in medical technologies and innovations (like barcodes on surgical instruments) that could decrease the number of errors.</li>
    <li>Leave a space on death certificates that indicate when an error occurred that directly or indirectly led to the death of a patient. (He also wants to ensure that doctors are protected from lawsuits, which is to be expected; he is, after all, a doctor.)</li>
</ol>
The BMJ study also lists three steps to decrease the number of unnecessarily deaths from medical errors: &#x201C;making errors more visible when they occur so their effects can be intercepted; having remedies at hand to rescue patients; and making errors less frequent by following principles that take human limitations into account.&#x201D;

Something must be done to put an end to these mistakes once and for all. We understand that doctors are people, and people make mistakes &#x2013; but without any real accountability, there is no incentive for hospitals to taker a good, hard look at the problem, and implement strategies designed to end it.

It is not that we don&#x2019;t care for change or progress. It&#x2019;s more that we see so many instances where technology is at the root of serious, injury-inducting mistakes. For every piece of automotive safety equipment that hits the market, there is a news story about an older life-changing piece of tech that turns out to be more dangerous than we thought.

The latest case involves keyless ignitions. <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/keyless-automobile-ignition-systems-are-fatally-flawed-critics-say-n490111">NBC News reports</a> that a design flaw in the ignition system could keep your car running for hours. If you park your inside the garage, the carbon monoxide that builds up can leak into your home. This exact scenario, according to the founder of safety group <a href="http://www.kidsandcars.org/">KidsAndCars.org</a>, has led to the death of 19 people since 2009.
<h2>Why does it happen?</h2>
Janette Fennell is the founder of KidsAndCars.org, and she explains the reasoning behind the keyless ignition problem this way:

&quot;In the past, you had a traditional metal key that you could only remove from the ignition when you shifted the vehicle into park and the key had been turned to the off position. Keyless ignition vehicles completely upend that relationship. In most vehicles you can exit with the fob - which most drivers believe is the key - and the engine will keep running until it is out of fuel. You need the fob to start the vehicle, but it plays absolutely no role in turning it off.&quot;

To combat the problem, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed an alarm system that would let drivers know the car was still running. That proposal came in 2011; nothing has been done about it since. The Center for Auto Safety recommends, instead of a warning system, that car manufacturers include an automatics engine shut-off as part of the software, and wants the NHTSA to enforce such a ruling. Without NHTSA regulation, there is no way to force automakers to build the component in.

Some manufacturers have recalled older models of their cars for just this reason (Chevy and Lincoln among them), and new models of certain cars do come equipped with an automatic engine shut-off. Unfortunately, until there are rules in place demanding it, there is no way to guarantee that automakers will spend the money to fix the problem.

There are separate laws and regulations that apply to truck drivers and trucking companies. For instance, truck drivers are only allowed to be on the road for a certain period of time. And they&#x2019;re required to keep track of this time in a log. The law only requires trucking companies to keep track of these logs, or to maintain these logs, for a set period of time &#x2013; as little as six months. In addition, trucking companies and insurance companies have teams of investigators that are on the scene of every trucking crash within hours of it occurring. As a result, if you or a loved one has been involved in a trucking crash, it&#x2019;s imperative that you seek legal representation as soon as possible.

<h1>Time Is of the Essence After a Commercial Truck Accident</h1>
Commercial truck accidents can be devastating to you and your family. Getting the compensation you deserve can offset mounting medical and other expenses and help your family get back to normal after a serious accident. However, trucking companies spend a great deal of time and money to protect their assets. For this reason, filing a claim for damages should be done as quickly as possible.
<h2>What&#x2019;s the rush?</h2>
Commercial trucking companies dispatch teams of investigators and accident reconstruction specialists after a wreck. By creating massive amounts of information, the lawyers employed by these large companies can create a narrative about the accident that often is only loosely based on the truth.

Information about an accident degrades quickly. Personal recollection is flawed after a trauma, which is why first responders attempt to collect information from coherent victims and uninjured bystanders. In addition, the law mandates that written or electronic logs be maintained for short periods of time, after which the truck company may legally destroy them. For these reasons, it is vital that seek you expert counsel as soon as possible after an accident.

Depending on your injuries, you may be unable to take pictures or make notes of anything at the scene of the accident. If you were rendered unconscious by the impact or experienced a concussion or more serious injury, recollecting the accident may be difficult or impossible. There is no substitute for experienced legal counsel after an accident, no matter how small.

If you or a loved one has been injured in a commercial truck accident, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries. The experienced and compassionate Ohio and Kentucky commercial truck accident lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

A quick Google search of &#x201C;crazy cargo spills&#x201D; nets more than 400,000 hits, while &#x201C;truck accidents&#x201D; results in a whopping 48 million results. Video compilations of truck accidents get millions of views, further proof of our fascination with the spectacle of destruction.
<h2>Cargo spills can be funny&#x2026;</h2>
The <a href="http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/traffic/5-crazy-overturned-truck-accidents-ohio/nrNh7/">Dayton Daily News</a> recently published a fun little article that highlighted cargo spills from commercial truck accidents in Ohio in just the past year. The cargo in question ran the gamut from grain feed to road paint to piglets, an incident we wrote about last September. However, these aren&#x2019;t the most unusual cargo spills we&#x2019;ve heard about. <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/29575/8-strange-things-trucks-have-spilled-besides-corndogs">Mental Floss</a> compiled a list of the strangest truck spills from around the world. Highlights include:

&#xA0;
<ul>
    <li>40,000 pounds of sausage spilled across Interstate 43 in Wisconsin.</li>
    <li>5,000 gallons of molasses created a sticky situation in Sugar Land, Texas (no kidding) and required more than 8 hours to clean up.</li>
    <li>A 56-foot whale exploded while being transported to a research facility in Taiwan. The dead whale burst after gases from decomposition built up to an explosive level.</li>
    <li>12 packs of Keystone Light were scattered over an embankment in Colorado after a truck took a turn too quickly. Three beer trucks spilled cargo on the same ramp in a single year.</li>
    <li>35,000 pounds of explosives were spilled after a rollover in Utah. In a scene worthy of any action movie, the driver and passenger escaped the rigs just before an explosion that left a 30-foot deep crater in the road. Nearby concrete barriers were flung hundreds of feet; incredibly, no one was injured.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&#x2026;. But the consequences can be deadly</h2>
While these stories are excellent fodder for jokes (a <a href="http://fox11online.com/news/offbeat/overturned-truck-spills-load-of-corn-on-ohio-road">recent corn spill</a> in Anderson County was referred to as &#x201C;aMAZEing&#x201D;), cargo spills are no laughing matter. When cargo blankets a highway, new obstacles are created and detours are required that jam traffic for hours. Accidents are far more likely to occur in stop and go traffic, and unfamiliar routes have drivers checking GPS directions and traffic updates more often instead of focusing on the road.

The cost doesn&#x2019;t stop with traffic detours, congestion, and fender benders. Cleaning up large or hazardous cargo poses a unique set of risks to drivers, including heavy machinery and rescue vehicles fighting to get through traffic. While safer trucks would obviously benefit everyone on the road, a <a href="http://www.gobytrucknews.com/cost-of-traffic-50-billion/123">new study</a> from the American Transportation Research Institute calculated that traffic jams, some stemming from truck accidents themselves, cost the trucking industry a staggering $49.6 billion in 2014. For big companies, there is no greater incentive than the bottom line.

Until these improvements get on the road, truck accidents and their consequences continue to threaten the safety of you and yours. The best driving habits can&#x2019;t prevent accidents, and when big trucks are involved, the consequences are often catastrophic.

If you or your loved one was injured in a commercial truck accident, you may be entitled to compensation.

<h1>Did Your Medical Provider Falsify Your Medical Records?</h1>
Proving the falsification of medical records can be extremely difficult, and it&#x2019;s not something you should attempt to do on your own. Experienced legal counsel, working with teams of medical professionals and forensic experts, can help prove your case and get you the compensation you deserve.
<h2>Know your rights, protect your records</h2>
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) established several important facts about your medical records. First and foremost, the information in your record belongs to you, and you are entitled to access your <em>unaltered </em>medical records upon request. Your medical records are a legal document; they are a comprehensive and definitive history of treatment, and alteration in any way is a crime.

Healthcare providers receive rigid instructions about adding or removing information to or from your record. Violating those protocols results in criminal liability. Despite these deterrents, providers falsify records to try to protect themselves when they have not provided a reasonable standard of care. Records can be falsified by:
<ul>
    <li>Omitting information about treatment at any time.</li>
    <li>Altering information about the timeline of treatment.</li>
    <li>Altering information about the type of treatment provided.</li>
    <li>Revising earlier entries when new information is discovered.</li>
</ul>
<h2>False records can kill</h2>
Falsifying medical records isn&#x2019;t just a crime; it&#x2019;s dangerous. Inaccurate or incomplete information can result in misdiagnosis or improper treatment, especially in emergency situations. An accurate timeline of your medical care is vital to your health.

If you believe that your healthcare provider has altered your medical records, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio medical malpractice lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and ensure the accuracy of your medical records.

Commercial vehicles often use the shortcut between I-64 and US 127 to disastrous effect; large trucks are involved in accidents on the road more than six times as often as on nearby US 127.

The National Truck Network

The National Truck Network is a federal registry that determines the maximum commercial vehicle size for state highways. The emergency authorization bans commercial trucks with trailers 53 feet and longer or 8.5 feet wide and wider. Smaller vehicles will still be able to use the road. The ban is unfortunately only temporary; removal from the National Network requires formal notice in the Federal Register and a public comment period before a final petition is submitted for approval.

The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is responsible for notifying the affected parties, including trucking associations, local industry and law enforcement. Signs and notices will be posted to direct trucks that exceed the size limitation to an alternate route. The Cabinet is hopeful that this measure will reduce the number of accidents on the roadway, which sees more than 800 commercial every day. The oversize vehicle ban comes on the heels of a lawsuit filed by residents who live and work on the busy highway.
<h2>Outspoken citizens make a difference</h2>
According to <a href="http://www.ttnews.com/articles/basetemplate.aspx?storyid=41832&amp;page=1">Transport Topics</a>:

&#x201C;A group of residents who live along Ky. 151 filed a lawsuit in Franklin Circuit Court asking a judge to force the state to prohibit tractor-trailers from using a segment of the road. That suit had named the state Department of Highways and the transportation secretary as defendants. Residents along the road have seen numerous accidents. In May 2013, a big truck ran off the road and crashed into the bedroom of a house. In 2014, a truck carrying grain alcohol ran off the road and spilled the load onto private property.&#x201D;

The small community of neighbors believes that the ban is a step in the right direction, but not far enough. Resident Charles Lockyer told NBC Lex 18, &#x201C;The trucks should not be allowed on this road. It&#x2019;s one of those things, an obvious solution, just too many people ignore.&#x201D; Neighbor Tom Isaac said of the measure, &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t take all of the trucks off. And then you start splitting hairs. Well is it 53 feet long? 53 and six inches long?&#x201D;

While lawmakers work to reduce the risk of an accident, residents continue to suffer the ill effects of oversized vehicles on undersized roads. Even on major highways designed to handle 18-wheelers, accidents have devastating consequences. When big trucks wreck on small roadways, the damage they cause is proportionally greater.

If you or a loved one has been injured in a commercial vehicle accident, regardless of the size of the truck, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Kentucky commercial truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

There is a lot of documentation out there about the <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article54997560.html">generally low scores</a> that Kentucky hospitals, and <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/life/wellness/2015/07/28/hospitals-get-poor-marks-avoiding-infections/30805551/">Louisville hospitals in general</a>, receive when it comes to preventing infections like MRSA (a <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/basics/definition/con-20024479">staph infection</a> that&#x2019;s resistant to many common antibiotics) and c. diff (a <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/dxc-20202389">bacterial infection</a> that can lead to death if left untreated). In fact, the scores have been so low, that after an uptick in MRSA and c. diff cases, <a href="http://www.wlky.com/news/louisville-hospital-uses-lightemitting-robots-to-kill-germs/39632112">one local Louisville hospital</a> bought a $100,000 UVC light-emitting robot to disinfect their rooms.

We were recently told a story about a patient who was sent to a Louisville area hospital for a steroid epidural to help with pain management. &#xA0;This is normally a 20-minute in-and-out procedure, so it is not as if the person was in the hospital for a long time. Two days later, that patient was diagnosed with an epidural abscess due to a MRSA infection. The abscess was compressing the spinal cord and caused severe neurological deficits. And from what we hear, when the patient was admitted she was told by a healthcare provider that she was not the only case of MRSA due to a steroid epidural performed at this facility.
<h2>This is not an unprecedented story</h2>
Back in 2009, a Missouri man named Joel Burnette had a steroid epidural to cure his pain after a medical procedure gone wrong. A week later, he was found disoriented in his apartment by his girlfriend. After being rushed to the hospital, Mr. Burnette was diagnosed with a MRSA infection, which left him &#x201C;with damaged and chronically inflamed spinal nerves that left him impotent and without control of his bladder or bowels. He had trouble walking and was in constant pain,&#x201D; according to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/7/jury-awards-nearly-3-million-in-malpractice-case/">The Washington Times</a>. The pain was so intense that Mr. Burnette committed suicide in 2013.

More recently, Daniel Fells, a tight end for the NY Giants, almost saw the end of his career in 2015 after a MRSA infection nearly took his foot. <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/giants-dedicate-game-ball-to-daniel-fells-battling-mrsa-in-foot/">CBS Sports</a> reported that the infection came after receiving a cortisone shot. He underwent 10 surgeries to save that foot.
<h2>How this information comes together</h2>
<strong>Here is what we know</strong>: a patient entered a Louisville area hospital for a steroid epidural and was diagnosed with a MRSA infection soon after. The infection led to an epidural abscess adjacent to patient&#x2019;s spinal column. In order for MRSA to infect the patient&#x2019;s spinal column, it likely was on the needle used for the injection, or the actual steroid solution was contaminated.

<strong>We also know</strong>, based on numerous reports over the years, that Kentucky hospitals (and Louisville hospitals in particular) have been having difficulty preventing the spread of MRSA and c. diff infections in their facilities.

<strong>Finally, we know</strong> of at least two other documented stories of people developing MRSA infections after being given a steroid injection.

<em>What we do not know</em> is whether or not this patient is one of many patients who developed a MRSA infection after receiving a steroid epidural at a Kentucky hospital, or what that hospital has done to:
<ol>
    <li>Inform patients of a potential problem, or</li>
    <li>Fix the problem, either by testing their steroids or by initiating a shutdown of some kind.</li>
</ol>
If there is a chance of an outbreak of MRSA, hospitals must follow protocol to ensure that their patients are not at risk. Failure to warn their patients or the public could lead to the unnecessary illnesses or even deaths of innocent people. If you have recently received a steroid epidural that was soon followed by an infection at the site, or level, of the injection, please have yourself tested for MRSA immediately. Untreated, a MRSA infection can be fatal.

If you have been diagnosed with MRSA after receiving a steroid epidural at a Kentucky hospital, you may be entitled to compensation for your pain and your medical bills. Crandall &amp; Pera Law is actively investigating these types of claims, and we can advise you as to your next steps if you were harmed.

The mental health crisis (or the gun industry, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/26/gun-control-americans-overwhelmingly-blame-mental-health-failures-for-mass-shootings/">depending on whom you ask</a>). Media pundits and bloggers and politicians and writers and artists and anyone else you ask will say that victim blaming is despicable &#x2013; to which we reply, &#x201C;The lady doth protest too much, methinks,&#x201D; based on the frequency of its occurrence.

So every time we hear someone talk about &#x201C;tort reform,&#x201D; what we really hear is victim blaming. Tort reform has become the war cry of the ill-informed, who genuinely believe that capping the amount of damages a medical malpractice victim is eligible to receive will save taxpayers money.

It won&#x2019;t. It can&#x2019;t. The only thing tort reform does is make sure that insurance carriers stay rich and allow negligent doctors to continue to practice medicine with little to no accountability for their actions.
<h2>Debunking the myths behind malpractice payouts</h2>
The media has changed the country&#x2019;s perception of what medical malpractice is, and what tort reform is. One of the more recent articles we&#x2019;ve seen comes from the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/darryl-s-weiman-md-jd/the-affordable-care-act-a_b_10035394.html">Huffington Post</a>, wherein the author argues the Affordable Care Act doesn&#x2019;t do enough towards tort reform. So we want to address the most common arguments we hear and debunk them once and for all.

<strong>MYTH</strong>: <strong>Tort reform will lower the cost of my healthcare.</strong>

<strong>FACT:</strong> No, it won&#x2019;t. It hasn&#x2019;t lowered the costs of care for people who live in states that have placed damage caps on injury compensation, and it won&#x2019;t lower your costs, either.

<strong>MYTH:</strong> <strong>Tort reform will stop all the extra expenses associated with &#x201C;defensive medicine.&#x201D;</strong>

<strong>FACT:</strong> Defensive medicine is a scare tactic created by hospitals. Doctors are <em>supposed</em> to order tests if they cannot diagnose your illness. And all of those alleged extra tests they keep ordering? They account for about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/15/study-dont-expect-big-health-care-savings-from-medical-malpractice-reform/">2.9% of a hospital&#x2019;s costs altogether</a>. Placing caps on damages won&#x2019;t stop doctors from ordering tests &#x2013; but if it does, then we might see more lawsuits involving doctors&#x2019; failure to diagnose a problem.

<strong>MYTH:</strong> <strong>Now that more people are insured, more medical malpractice cases will happen.</strong>

<strong>FACT:</strong> Who says this is true? There&#x2019;s no reasonable basis for this belief outside of the idea that it *seems* like it should be right. If more people seem injured because they now have health care, that&#x2019;s on the doctors, not the patients.

<strong>MYTH: Tort reform will stop runaway juries.</strong>

<strong>FACT:</strong> Here&#x2019;s the crux, right? The runaway juries who throw millions and millions of dollars at people. You&#x2019;re right; with damage caps, juries can&#x2019;t exceed a certain amount of money in terms of compensation &#x2013; <em>for non-economic damages, that is</em>. These types of caps don&#x2019;t actually cap economic losses at all. So if a man has a leg amputated by a negligent doctor, and it costs him, say, $3.5 million in hospital stays, lost income, prosthetics, therapy and medications, capping a compensatory award at $500,000 million won&#x2019;t stop him from being granted the full $3.5 million in monetary losses he sustained.

And before you say, <em>Well, that seems fair; half a million dollars is a lot of money</em>, let us pose these questions to you: how much is <em>your</em> leg worth? How much is your ability to walk, run, dance at your child&#x2019;s wedding or drive a car worth to you? What if it was your daughter, son, or spouse? What if that doctor cut through his or her heart, as opposed to the wrong leg &#x2013; is the life of your loved one worth $500,000 then?

If these scenarios seem unnecessarily harsh, it&#x2019;s because tort reform only hurts victims. Juries and judges decide the amount of money a person is due, not the person who was hurt. If an act of medical malpractice leaves a person paralyzed at 16, he or she will need a lot more money than $500,000 to live the rest of his or her life.

At the heart of the matter is this: when you make it easier for doctors and hospitals to get away with gross negligence by only paying an award that amounts to a slap on the wrist, then there is little to no motivation for those doctors and hospitals to do better. If a store can have a policy that says, &#x201C;You break it, you buy it,&#x201D; then at the very least we can demand the same from our healthcare providers.

<img class="alignright wp-image-4852 size-medium" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wrongful-death-300x270.png" alt="Ohio and Kentucky Wrongful Death Attorneys" width="300" height="270">A wrongful death claim is one that alleges a person has died because of the intentional or negligent actions (or inactions) of another person or entity. They are civil lawsuits, meaning a person can file a claim even there was a criminal trial about the death and the person was found innocent of a crime; the O.J. Simpson case is, perhaps, the most well-known example of a successful civil claim in the wake of a not guilty verdict in criminal court.

The laws and statutes governing wrongful death claims change from state to state. We practice in both Ohio and Kentucky, and the laws are similar but not exactly the same.
<h2>Kentucky&#x2019;s rules and regulations</h2>
In Kentucky, a wrongful death claim can only be brought by a personal representative of the victim&#x2019;s estate. If the claim is successful, the damages awarded will pay off any debts or liens against the estate, and the remainder will be divided among the surviving family members:
<ul>
    <li>Spouses</li>
    <li>Children</li>
    <li>Parents (if there are no surviving children or spouses)</li>
    <li>Beneficiaries or heirs named in a will (if there are no surviving spouses, children or parents)</li>
</ul>
You must file your claim within <strong>one year</strong> from the appointment of a personal representative for the estate, but <strong>not to exceed two years</strong> from the death. In the claim, you may seek compensation for lost wages, any costs associated with the funeral or administration of the estate, and a loss of consortium. In cases where the wrongful death was the result of gross negligence or an intentional or willful act, you may also be able to claim punitive damages from the other party.
<h2>Ohio&#x2019;s rules and regulations</h2>
Wrongful death claims in Ohio are a bit different. You have <strong>two years</strong> from the date of death to file a claim. Like in Kentucky, Ohio also requires a personal representative to file a claim, and immediate family members &#x2013; spouses, children and parents &#x2013; may be entitled to recover losses. If a non-immediate member of the family, such as an aunt or a grandparent, can prove that he or she sustained losses because of the death of the victim, then he or she may also be eligible for compensation as well.

Ohio allows claimants to pursue damages for:
<ul>
    <li>Loss of income and future income</li>
    <li>Funeral and medical costs</li>
    <li>Loss of consortium</li>
    <li>Loss of services provided by the deceased</li>
    <li>Mental anguish, pain and suffering</li>
    <li>Loss of future inheritances</li>
</ul>
<h2>A few final thoughts</h2>
We have met with countless clients over the years who have mixed feelings about filing a wrongful death claim. Some people are angry and want the guilty party to pay. Some people feel as though they are trying to profit off of the death of their loved one. We understand how emotions can run high, and how the idea of a lawsuit can seem difficult to comprehend so soon after your loss. But you are well within your legal rights to file such a claim. Death is, among other things, very expensive. An award can help you pay off the medical bills you accrued, or help ensure that your children won&#x2019;t lose their home so soon after they lost a parent. It&#x2019;s about holding people and companies accountable for their actions, so that you do not have bear the brunt of those actions while also trying to piece your life back together. It&#x2019;s about seeking justice through a system designed to do just that.

These types of claims should be handled with care by a skilled wrongful death attorney. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we have substantial experience protecting families and their futures after someone else&#x2019;s negligence led to a tragic loss.

If someone were to ask me, what is the statute of limitations for malpractice case in Kentucky, what I would tell them is that they have one year from the date that they reasonably should have known that the injury they suffered was due to a medical care provider&#x2019;s negligence. Now a good example of that would be this case I handled a number of years ago. A gentleman was going in for a routine surgery, and he had to have a preoperative x-ray. And that x-ray revealed that he had a hemostat in his stomach.

And a hemostat, just think of it as a big pair of pliers, about this big, the surgeon uses when they operate. Well this gentleman hadn&apos;t had surgery for 10 years. And, we knew, obviously, a hemostat shouldn&apos;t have been left in during surgery, that he had been malpracticed 10 years earlier. The law allows for him to still bring that claim because he had no reason to know that the doctor had malpracticed him until he got news of this x-ray.

Now another caveat to the statute of limitations is that if a physician or nurse injures you, and they continue to treat you for that injury, until their treatment ends the statute of limitations does not begin. So if a doctor injures you during a surgery and you have complications and you&apos;re in the hospital for months on end being treated for that, until that doctor finishes his treatment of those complications, your statute of limitations is on hold. But once that treatment ends, that one year time period begins to run.

Another caveat is in the instance of death. If for some reason the medical care provider should commit malpractice and it results in your death, then you will have up to one year after a personal representative has been appointed for your estate not to exceed two years. There are other nuances to the statute of limitations, and every case is a little different. If you have any questions whatsoever, I would suggest you contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law or another qualified attorney and explain to them your situation, because if you let the time run out, there is no way we can fix it.

The statute of limitations for filing a medical malpractice claim in Kentucky is just one short year. Every case is different, but time is always of the essence when pursuing a medical negligence case. If you believe that you or a loved one has been the victim of medical negligence, there is no substitute for experienced legal counsel on your side.
<h2>How Kentucky defines one year</h2>
There is always some confusion over when, exactly, the one-year limitation expires. The limitation begins after treatment ends and as soon as you can reasonably be expected to know that a medical provider has caused you harm. While certain specific claims can be filed outside that one-year window, it is rare that the court will allow older cases to be heard. Exceptions exist, but your best chance to recover damages for your injury or illness is to file a claim as soon as possible.

Filing a medical negligence claim within one year of an injury or illness can be a daunting task. Often, you and your family are struggling to recover from the emotional and financial toll that results from a serious health problem. The experienced and compassionate Kentucky medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can provide relief and answers in your time of need. Our team will evaluate your case and get you the compensation you need to get back to normal. For a free consultation, call 877.651.7764 or contact us today.

Reports surfaced that Mirra had struggled with depression following his retirement in 2011; family and friends said that Mirra was an &#x201C;adrenaline junkie&#x201D; who struggled to find a replacement for the thrill of his BMX days. Some, like Allen Thomas, mayor of Mirra&#x2019;s hometown, speculated that chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was the cause of the superstar&#x2019;s untimely death, while others claimed that the sport was unlikely to cause the condition.
<h2>Milestone for CTE sufferers</h2>
As of late May, the results are in. Dave Mirra is officially the first extreme sport athlete to be diagnosed with the degenerative disease. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/24/health/dave-mirra-cte-bmx-biker/index.html">CNN</a> reported, &#x201C;CNN affiliate&#xA0;WITN&#xA0;spoke with University of Toronto neuropathologist Dr. Lili-Naz Hazrati, who confirmed Mirra&apos;s diagnosis. She said that the tau deposits found in Mirra&apos;s brain were similar to that of professional football players and hockey players diagnosed with CTE.&#x201D;

Widow Lauren Mirra released a statement in response to the medical report thanking fans, friends, and family for their support in the wake of the tragedy. The statement also announced plans to create a platform to raise awareness and fund research for CTE. This effort marks the first initiative by the alternative sports world to become involved in what is rapidly being recognized as a global problem. Education efforts help spread awareness that even precautions like padding and controlled falls aren&#x2019;t enough to prevent the development of CTE.
<h2>Why awareness is important</h2>
Understanding how mental health affects our loved ones is vital. Without knowledge and understanding, it can be difficult or impossible for victims of mental health disorders to receive the treatment they so desperately need. Dave Mirra&#x2019;s unnecessary death is a case in point; there was no precedent for CTE in BMX athletes, and no one thought that the condition could be the underlying cause of Mirra&#x2019;s mental health issues. Depression and memory loss in suspected CTE victims can be treated more aggressively and taken more seriously by family and healthcare professionals alike. Raising awareness helps everyone.

If you believe that your loved one is suffering from a mental health disorder, seek professional medical advice immediately. There is no shame in mental health; the danger lies in leaving a life-threatening condition untreated.

If your loved one has suffered a traumatic brain injury, seek professional medical attention immediately. When an accident causes a brain injury, there are serious consequences that affect your loved one and your family forever. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio traumatic brain injury attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve. Call 877.686.8879 for our Ohio team, 877.651.7764 for our Kentucky team, or <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">contact us </a>today for a free consultation.

As the evidence continued to mount, reality could no longer be ignored; Zika was a problem, and otherwise healthy pregnant women were giving birth to infants suffering from impaired brain and skull development in large numbers.
<h2>Why it took so long to see the problem</h2>
Zika hasn&#x2019;t received much attention in the past. The disease was discovered in 1947 during routine screening tests for yellow fever. Since its discovery, outbreaks have been small and isolated. It wasn&#x2019;t until late 2015 that anyone suspected that the Zika virus could have devastating consequences for unborn children. Since then, scientists have been working around the clock to figure out how to prevent the damage that Zika causes.

The first step to solving a problem is to understand it. The scientific community was skeptical that Zika caused birth defects because there are very few viruses that can affect a fetus, largely because of the effectiveness of the placental barrier. During pregnancy, the placenta controls the fetal environment; it maintains independent blood supplies and regulates nutrient intake and waste elimination. In addition, the placenta acts as a selective barrier that allows for the transmission of certain antibodies from mother to child, providing temporary protection for an infant in the months after birth.
<h2>Understanding means progress, not prevention</h2>
A new study, published in the journal <em>Cell</em>, confirms that Zika does indeed cross the placental barrier. In fact, the virus shows a preference for placental tissue; concentrations of the virus were 1,000 times higher in the placenta than elsewhere in the body. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zika-shown-to-penetrate-the-placenta-strengthening-its-link-to-birth-defects/">Scientific American</a> reported, &#x201C;Once in the placenta, the virus begins to infect the cells of the trophoblast&#x2014;the tissue that supplies nourishment to the embryo&#x2014;and damages the blood capillaries of the fetus. &#x2018;Previous work already showed that late-stage placental cells were resistant to infection; now our study shows that the virus is able to cross the barrier between the maternal tissue and the fetus,&#x2019; the scientists wrote in their paper.&#x201D;

In another study, published at nearly the same time, Chinese researchers confirmed brain development is severely inhibited in the presence of Zika. Armed with this knowledge, researchers are hopeful that an effective vaccine will be developed quickly. In the meantime, however, Zika has arrived in our backyards. The mosquito vector, combined with the possibility of sexual transmission, greatly increases the chance of infection.

If you or your loved one is pregnant, your doctor can test you for Zika virus. Unfortunately, there is no way to know how the virus will affect pregnancy, or whether the fetus is also affected. If you have been or are currently in an area with Zika, and your doctor failed to inform you of the possible risks, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio medical malpractice lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

About a year ago, in May 2015, <a href="https://backchannel.com/the-view-from-the-front-seat-of-the-google-self-driving-car-46fc9f3e6088#.534ka7f2c">Google told us</a> that their self-driving cars had driven 1.7 million miles, and only been involved in 11 auto accidents. If it is true that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/">at least eight people per day are killed</a> in distracted driving-related auto accidents, then 11 accidents in total is pretty impressive.

Around the same time as Google&#x2019;s reveal, the first self-driving Freightliner truck hit the road. (CNN.com even <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/06/autos/self-driving-truck/">has a video of the truck driver</a> using his iPad while the truck is in motion.) Before we had even wrapped our heads around the idea of an autonomous vehicle, trucks were being tested. Large-scale commercial trucks &#x2013; 18-wheelers, big rigs, semis, tractor-trailers &#x2013; were poised to begin their treks across the highways of America with little to no human interaction.

This was, in some ways, the realization of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/">Internet of Things</a>, a process whereby our machines communicate with one another via data gathering and cloud storage. The <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/need-a-better-thermostat-look-to-your-smartphone/">thermostat</a> you can change with your smartphone, the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/touchscreen-refrigerators-and-talking-everything-at-ces-2016/">refrigerator</a> that tells you when you are low on milk, and now the commercial trucks that can drive themselves &#x2013; these are the technologies of the future, and they are awe-inspiring.

Until something goes wrong, that is. Then they are a potential nightmare.
<h2>Parsing liability in the event of an accident</h2>
Say what you want about limiting driver fatigue, or having a truck that, perhaps, can rebalance itself while moving, thus avoiding any debris spills or even tip-overs. What we want to know is, when the computers fail or a car cuts the truck off, and the inevitable truck accident happens, what becomes of the victims? Who is responsible when an automated truck short-circuits, hits a passenger car, and causes the death of the driver or passenger(s)?

It could be the manufactures. It could be the coders. It could be the designers. It could be almost anyone (a logistical nightmare), and as usual, the victim is the one who suffers. Human drivers make a lot of errors, yes, but they have one thing that autonomous vehicles don&#x2019;t &#x2013; <em>instincts.</em> Those instincts are what protect drivers on the road every day, as we make split-second decisions that are based in our inherently human will to survive. An autonomous truck won&#x2019;t have that benefit.

As an <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/self-driving/can-you-program-ethics-into-a-selfdriving-car">article on IEEE.org</a> puts it:

&#x201C;Today no court ever asks why a driver does anything in particular in the critical moments before a crash. The question is moot as to liability&#x2014;the driver panicked, he wasn&#x2019;t thinking, he acted on instinct. But when robots are doing the driving, &#x2018;Why?&#x2019; becomes a valid question. Human ethical standards, imperfectly codified in law, make all kinds of assumptions that engineers have not yet dared to make. <strong>The most important such assumption is that a person of good judgment will know when to disregard the letter of the law in order to honor the spirit of the law.</strong> What engineers must now do is teach the elements of good judgment to cars and other self-guided machines&#x2014;that is, to robots&#x201D; (emphasis ours).

Technology is incredible, but all progress brings some dangers. Ignoring those dangers is beyond foolish, even in the name of progress. Our fear is that, at the end of the day, people who are injured when an electrical sensor fails &#x2013; while in a tunnel, or on a highway, or literally anywhere on any road across America &#x2013; will lose one of their fundamental rights: to seek justice in a court of law for the injuries and havoc wreaked upon them. We must pay attention to the ethical and practical implications of an autonomous vehicle in the event of a truck accident, and we must do it before those accidents occur.

They are also used to help a woman in labor manage the pains associated with giving birth. Generally speaking, a doctor injects a steroid into the epidural space next to your spinal cord, and the steroids ease the inflammation of the nerve roots, which in turns alleviates the pain a person feels.

But steroid injections are delicate procedures, and one mistake &#x2013; even one that seems minor &#x2013; can lead to serious side effects. <a href="http://www.spine-health.com/treatment/injections/epidural-steroid-injections-risks-and-side-effects">Spine-Health</a> tells us that some of the more common complications include:
<ul>
    <li>Like the patient who developed MRSA, any patient who has a spinal injection runs the risk of an infection. A contaminated needle or medication can cause illness, as can the passing of an infection from one part of the body to another. A spinal cord infection can lead to paralysis in some cases.</li>
    <li><strong>Dural puncture.</strong> Also called a &#x201C;wet tap,&#x201D; a Dural puncture can lead to headaches that may or may not clear up on their own.</li>
    <li><strong>Nerve damage.</strong> Nerve damage can be the result of a misplaced needle, and some damage may be permanent. It is possible that the recurring pain you are treating will no longer be treatable and may, in fact, get worse.</li>
</ul>
Some rarer complications may also include changes in blood sugar levels, a weakened immune system and ulcers. Based on our own experiences, we know that ESIs can also lead to strokes, arterial damage and internal bleeding, all of which can prove fatal in some extreme cases. Patients also run the risk of going into cardiac or respiratory arrest if they are given the wrong dosage of their medication.

Any time a healthcare professional does anything to the spine, the spinal cord, or the areas surrounding the spinal cord, there will be risks. The problem is that because of the sensitive nature of your nerves, and because the spinal cord is what allows your brain to tell your body what to do, what might be a nuisance side effect in other procedures could be the difference of life or death in a spinal procedure. Infections can spread quickly throughout the body, so it is crucial that you find a doctor and report any effects that are out of the ordinary, or that do not subside within the time they should.

If you were injured while receiving an epidural steroid injection, or contracted an illness during your time in the healthcare facility, Crandall &amp; Pera Law may be able to help you. Our skilled medical malpractice attorneys in Kentucky and Ohio can advise you about your options if medical negligence or a defective drug led to your harm.

BODY:
We write about the dangers of big trucks on the road all the time, usually with a signature &#x201C;be safe and be careful.&#x201D; Every once in a while, it&#x2019;s worth revisiting exactly what that means. Everyone knows that different cars handle differently; your four-door sedan and your neighbor&#x2019;s 3-ton pickup truck have very different sightlines, cornering abilities, and stopping times. Commercial trucks handle these maneuvers in ways that are almost incomparable; here&#x2019;s how to share the road safely.
<h2>A good rule of thumb</h2>
If you can&#x2019;t see the driver of a big truck, either directly, in your mirrors, or his/her mirrors, they can&#x2019;t see you. Line of sight is tremendously important; big trucks don&#x2019;t have the benefit of rearview mirrors, so blind spots are larger and cover more area that in passenger vehicles. In big trucks, blind spots are referred to as &#x201C;no-zones,&#x201D; areas that other vehicles should stay out of to avoid being unintentionally hit. <a href="http://haulagereportnow.com/reasons-why-huge-trucks-behave-differently-from-your-car/">Haulage Report Now</a> illustrates the basic no-zones with this graphic.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4993 size-full" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-14-at-1.50.44-PM-1.png" alt="Know the &#x201C;No-Zones&#x201D;: How to Stay Safe around Big Trucks on the Road" width="513" height="201">

However, even this visual doesn&#x2019;t illustrate the true extent of the blind spots that truckers have to deal with. The lack of a rearview mirror makes drivers entirely reliant on their side view mirrors; as a result, a truly safe following distance directly behind a tractor-trailer is almost 200 feet. This gives you time to react to traffic in front of the truck that would be obscured when following more closely.
<h2>Passing and stopping</h2>
The <a href="http://www.trucking.org/article.aspx?uid=9338fc87-cfbd-4719-95ae-2f0d9444a2db">American Trucking Association</a> recommends, &#x201C;When passing a truck and moving back into its lane make sure you can see the truck&#x2019;s headlights in your rear view mirror before you cut back in. That allows the truck enough space to slow down or stop if something happens up ahead. ...Even if the driver makes a monumental effort they may not be able to stop if you haven&#x2019;t left them enough room. ...Don&#x2019;t fill in that space and take up that safety buffer that the driver is trying to maintain.&#x201D;

Professional truck drivers have a responsibility to operate their vehicles safely and with reasonable precaution, a responsibility that is shared by all motorists. Knowing how to safely share the road with large and small vehicles alike can prevent dangerous conditions that threaten everyone. Unfortunately, even the most cautious drivers can crash in the best conditions. When accidents involve big trucks, no one wins.

If you or your loved one has been the victim of a commercial truck accident, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries, medical bills and lost work. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio commercial truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

The agency is responsible for creating and enforcing the guidelines governing commercial driver&#x2019;s licenses (CDLs). The requirements for CDL qualification were overhauled in 2014 to make the screening process more effective. However, the agency is still plagued with problems; a recent CBS investigation revealed flaws in the application process that allow unqualified drivers to remain on the road.
<h2>Lying drivers kill innocent victims</h2>
<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-medically-unfit-commercial-drivers-end-up-behind-the-wheel-greyhound-bus-crash/">CBS</a> reported, &#x201C;Our investigation found cases where drivers left off dangerous medical conditions from the DOT medical form, which the driver is expected to fill out truthfully. ...Federal regulators don&#x2019;t track accidents caused by commercial drivers with medical conditions and states do not either. CBS News reached out to 24 states, but only four had detailed medical information on commercial vehicle crashes. A review of those reports found there were nearly 400 commercial vehicle accidents involving medical conditions in 2013 and 2014 alone.&#x201D;

The American Trucking Association believes that the DOT program needs further reform to keep dangerous drivers off the road. While the regulatory overhaul in 2014 was a step in the right direction, there are countless cases of accidents involving medically unqualified commercial drivers in the news. These cases include:
<ul>
    <li>Driver Dwayne Garrett was operating a Greyhound bus on a 90-day medical waiver under suspicion of sleep apnea. Garrett failed to disclose crucial details to his personal physician. After he caused an Ohio crash that injured more than 30 people, a court-ordered sleep test medically disqualified Garrett from holding a CDL.</li>
    <li>John Ray Carpenter, the owner-operator of a portable toilet service company, <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/4009926-septic-truck-driver-charged-vehicular-homicide">was involved in 13 accidents</a> over a 15-year span. Medical records revealed a history of sleep apnea dating to 2001 and multiple instances of improper hours logging, which increases the chances of fatigue. Carpenter somehow evaded technical and medical disqualification until he struck and killed a 31-year-old city employee in a head-on collision.</li>
    <li>Donald Larson, a school bus driver in Minnesota who <a href="http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/crime/2016/03/24/couple-whose-home-struck-school-bus-sues-driver-company/82204126/">jumped a curb</a> and caused more than $160,000 in damages when the bus collided with a home. By a miracle of circumstance, no one was injured during the accident. A pending lawsuit alleges that Larson suffers from a cardiovascular condition that caused the accident.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Flawed program threatens safety</h2>
Qualifying for a CDL <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration/commercial-drivers-license/medical">requires a Medical Examination</a> from a qualifying medical examiner. However, drivers may &#x201C;self-certify&#x201D; under certain circumstances. In every case above, the drivers were qualified to self-certify as long as their routes did not cross state lines. The only result of honesty is disqualification and the resulting loss of income. Until the legislation that permits self-certification is changed, unqualified commercial drivers will continue to pose a threat to everyone on the road.
If you or a loved one has been injured in a commercial truck accident, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries, medical bills and lost wages. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky commercial truck accident lawyers can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you need to get back to normal.

Like c. diff, MRSA is often contracted by patients in hospitals, and is therefore commonly referred to as a hospital acquired infection, or HAI.

A MRSA infection is a staph infection; staph is usually found on the skin, or in or around the nose. It is a highly contagious bacterial infection, which is why antibiotics are necessary to clear it up. MRSA, however, is a strain that is immune to certain antibiotics, which means doctors must find another way to treat the infection. Sometimes that involves using different medications than one might normally prescribe; sometimes it involves draining the infection site.
<h2>Symptoms of MRSA infections</h2>
In the beginning, a MRSA infection &#x201C;generally starts as swollen, painful red bumps that might resemble pimples or spider bites,&#x201D; <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/basics/symptoms/con-20024479">according to the Mayo Clinic</a>. Over time, those little bumps can fill with pus, or turn into painful abscesses that require draining. The site of the infection is often warm to the touch, and patients may develop a fever.

If the infection is left untreated, the MRSA bacteria can &#x201C;burrow&#x201D; into the body. This can lead to serious complications by spreading the infection to:
<ul>
    <li>Your bloodstream</li>
    <li>Your organs, including the heart or lungs</li>
    <li>Your joints</li>
    <li>Your bones</li>
</ul>
It can also develop into pneumonia or sepsis, a complication associated with blood infections that causes <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sepsis/home/ovc-20169784">inflammatory responses</a> throughout the body. Unchecked, sepsis can lead to septic shock, cause numerous body systems to fail, or even result in death.
<h2>Common HAIs outside of MRSA</h2>
MRSA, however, is not the only hospital acquired infection; in fact, it is not even the most common HAI. That list, according to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hai/surveillance/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, includes illnesses such as:
<ul>
    <li>Pneumonia</li>
    <li>diff, and other gastrointestinal infections</li>
    <li>Urinary tract infections</li>
    <li>Infections at surgical sites</li>
    <li>Central line infections caused by the used of catheters</li>
    <li>Primary bloodstream infections</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/life/wellness/2015/07/28/hospitals-get-poor-marks-avoiding-infections/30805551/">Kentucky hospitals in particular</a> struggle to prevent and control the spread of infections like MRSA and C. diff, both of which are highly contagious, and which are most dangerous to the very group of people most likely to contract them &#x2013; sick people. In comparison, Ohio hospitals&#x2019; number of reported HAIs are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/stateplans/factsheets/oh.pdf">significantly lower</a> than the national baseline&#x2019;s, according to the CDC.

When MRSA is detected, contained and treated, the symptoms can clear up within weeks &#x2013; sometimes even within days. When it is left untreated, however, it can spread to others easily, and can lead to the death of the patient. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we hold negligent health care providers accountable when they fail to diagnose MRSA in a timely manner, or when their actions have directly led to the spread of the infection.

It depends on the facts of your case, but there are a couple of guidelines that apply to every case, in terms of determining whether or not that case should be pursued. First we look at whether or not the doctor or nurse involved acted unreasonably, and if they acted unreasonably then that first element that we&#x2019;re looking for is satisfied&#x2026;.&#x201D;

We also look to see if there are sufficient recoverable damages in the case to justify the high expenses of litigation. In other words, even if there was malpractice, by the time we reach a settlement or verdict, will the expenses exceed the reasonable value of the person&#x2019;s injuries? This is the information we relay to you from the beginning, so you can always make informed decisions about your case.

The only way to know if you have a valid medical malpractice case is to contact experienced legal counsel. The experienced legal team at Crandall &amp; Pera Law has defended healthcare companies and their insurance companies in the past.

It&apos;s actually three things; it&apos;s proving the standard of care, proximate causation, and damages. Crandall &amp; Pera Law will analyze your medical records and hire independent medical experts to prove what the standard of care is, and that your physician failed to meet the standard of care. But our evaluation does not stop there &#x2013; we also have to prove what is called proximate cause.

Here&apos;s a quick example of proximate cause. If you&apos;re in a car and you go up to a stop sign, you are supposed to stop at the sign. If you don&apos;t and you go through the sign, then you were negligent. But if you go through the sign and don&apos;t hit anyone, then you have not proximately caused any damages. If you go to the stop sign in your car and you go through it, and you hit a car and injure individuals, then your negligence has proximately caused damages.

Crandall &amp; Pera Law will hire independent experts to evaluate proximate cause, and ensure that we prove that too.

Lastly, we have to prove damages. The types of damages that we see in medical negligence cases include death, scarring and disfigurement, and brain damage. If you have any other questions, or would like a free consultation on medical negligence, nursing home, commercial trucking or personal injury, feel free to send us an email, sent us a request on an online chat or contact us at either our Ohio or Kentucky numbers.
<h2>Medical negligence is more likely than ever</h2>
Recent studies have documented a chilling statistic; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/05/03/researchers-medical-errors-now-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-united-states/">medical errors are now the third leading cause of death in the United States</a>. Calculations estimate that medical errors kill nearly 251,000 people each year, a number that continues to grow. Worst of all, the rate of medical errors has not changed in nearly 16 years despite the continuing progress of medical research. When the rate of population growth is factored in, we see that the number of medical errors has actually increased year on year for more than decade.

These are sobering statistics. A September 2015 report from the <a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=21794">Institute of Medicine</a> found that most people suffer at least one wrong medical diagnosis in their life. As our population ages and more and more patients are treated by a flawed healthcare system, these numbers will only increase. In short, the likelihood that your loved one will be the victim of medical negligence increases all the time.

When your loved one is a victim of medical negligence, it can be difficult to know what to do. Mounting medical bills, declining health, and constant doctors visits create confusion and cause emotional turmoil. Consulting experienced legal counsel can cut through the complex issues and help you and your family during your time of need. The compassionate legal team at Crandall &amp; Pera Law has experience fighting big healthcare and the big companies that insure them. Let our family help yours.

Now, the CPSC has issued recalls for multiple companies concerning some half a million &#x201C;hoverboards&#x201D; with defective battery packs. The low quality Lithium-ion batteries have a nasty habit of exploding at inopportune moments and setting fire to nearby structures.
<h2>The scope of the problem</h2>
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/curtissilver/2016/07/06/cpsc-recalls-500000-hoverboards/#2b7f9873675d">Forbes</a> reported &#x201C;There have been at least 99 incidents reports of the battery packs in self-balancing scooters/hoverboards overheating, sparking, smoking, catching fire and/or exploding including reports of burn injuries and property damage. Consumers should immediately stop using these recalled products and contact the recalling company to return their hoverboard for a full refund, a free repair or a free replacement depending on the model.&#x201D;

&#xA0;

We wrote about the problems that plagued the popular toy in January, when the news broke that the low quality mass-produced Li-ion batteries that powered the devices were explosively discharging. The issue is so widespread in the toys that the US Trade Commission banned all hoverboards not manufactured by Segway in March.
<h2>What you need to know</h2>
So far, five companies account for almost 95% of the recalled units; in order, they are Swagway, Hovertrax, iMoto, Powerboard, and the Hype Roam. If you have one of these products in your home, contact the manufacturer immediately for a refund or authorized repair. The full list of the affected products is, referred to by the CPSC as self-balancing scooters, is available <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2016/Self-Balancing-Scooters-Hoverboards-Recalled-by-10-Firms/">here</a>.

If you haven&#x2019;t been affected by these faulty battery packs, but have these products in your home, you are at risk. The likelihood of a malfunction increases each time the product is used, charged, and discharged; the risk of catastrophe only goes up over time.

If your child was injured or your property was damaged by a defective hoverboard, you may be entitled to compensation for medical bills and property damage. The experienced defective product attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

BODY:
The statute of limitations in medical negligence cases is very important. First of all, what does that mean? It means that you only have a certain amount of time to investigate and file your medical negligence claim. The statute of limitations generally speaking can be as short as one year in the state of Ohio. Therefore, you need to come to Crandall &amp; Pera Law to get your case investigated as soon as you possibly can.

If you have any other questions, or would like a free consultation on medical negligence, nursing home commercial trucking or personal injury, feel free to send us an email, send us a request on an online chat, or contact us on either our Ohio or Kentucky numbers.

Medical negligence cases are complicated. You, the victim, carry the burden of proof; you must establishthat a particular person made an error that caused you harm. Just getting the relevant paperwork can be a massive task; when you are injured or sick, it can be impossible.
<h2>Waiting to file could cost your case</h2>
Ohio&#x2019;s statute of limitations for filing a medical negligence claim is one year. While some circumstances may allow you to file a medical malpractice lawsuit after a year, it becomes much more difficult. The sad fact is that the legal system requires you to consider filing a claim during an emotional and confusing time. The idea can be overwhelming, but the experienced and compassionate medical negligence lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help cut through the confusion and get your family back to normal.

If you or a loved one has been the victim of medical negligence, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries, illness, lost wages, medical care and other expenses. Our team of experienced Ohio medical malpractice attorneys and Registered Nurses will evaluate your case and answer your questions. For a free consultation, call 877.686.8879 or <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact us</a> today.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5029" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ikea&#x2019;s-Failure-to-Meet-Voluntary-Safety-Standards-Resulted-in-the-Largest-Furniture-Recall-in-US-History-300x200.jpg" alt="Ikea&#x2019;s Failure to Meet Voluntary Safety Standards Resulted in the Largest Furniture Recall in US History" width="300" height="200">Ikea, the flat-pack furniture behemoth with a flimsy object in every home, announced the recall of 29 million chests and dressers in a deal with federal regulators. The recalled units do not conform to voluntary safety standards for furniture, which suggest that extended drawers can carry up to 50lbs of pressure before the unit begins to tip. While the lack of industry regulations played a role, the company&#x2019;s unwillingness to comply with suggested standards directly caused this massive recall.
<h2>Efficient packaging leaves no room for voluntary compliance</h2>
Ikea specializes in lightweight, affordable furniture, a niche that caters to young urbanites and college students. Unfortunately, the reduction in weight and ease of assembly that make the furniture so affordable comes at a steep cost elsewhere; namely, quality. The company&#x2019;s private mission to make everything portable, easy to carry, and easy to assemble supersedes any concerns about compliance with voluntary regulations. It&#x2019;s a simple matter of the bottom line.

The recall, issued June 28, applies to all furniture that doesn&#x2019;t meet the minimum voluntary safety standards, and binds Ikea to offer either removal of the recalled units with a full refund or installation of a wall anchor to eliminate the tipping hazard. The company sought to ward off the recall last year by offering free wall anchor kits, a step considered wildly inadequate by safety advocates because consumers remained uninformed of the risks posed by unanchored furniture.
<h2>A recall 27 years in the making</h2>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/business/ikea-recall-tip-over-furniture.html">The New York Times</a> said of the recall, &#x201C;The move by the Swedish company, the world&#x2019;s largest furniture seller, represented a crucial victory for consumer advocates in a years&#x2019; long effort to hold it accountable for a growing death toll of young children dating to 1989.&#x201D; The furniture in question has crushed seven toddlers to death in tip-over accidents and caused more than 70 injuries over the years.

When corporate culture places efficiency above product safety, families suffer needlessly. Ikea&#x2019;s failure to comply with voluntary safety guidelines placed millions at risk, and left families devastated by the untimely deaths of young children whose eagerness to explore the world spelled their demise at the hands of a faceless corporation. Consumer Product Safety Commission chairman Elliot Kaye summed up the recall concisely, telling the Times, &#x201C;That doesn&#x2019;t exonerate them [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][Ikea] from the past, but it is, from a consumer-safety standpoint, a positive announcement.&#x201D;

There are only three in Kentucky, but the ones in Ohio are close enough, so altogether we&#x2019;re looking at a dozen amusements parks designed to let kids bounce to their hearts&#x2019; content. If the park isn&#x2019;t your thing, though, you can always purchase your own trampoline for the backyard, or enroll in a gymnastics class, or even rent a &#x201C;bounce house&#x201D; for your little ones.

All this jumping around is wreaking havoc on our bodies, and a new report from U.S. News &amp; World Report claims that &#x201C;U.S. emergency rooms saw a 12-fold increase in the number of patients injured at trampoline parks -- from 581 in 2010, to nearly 7,000 in 2014.&#x201D; There is no doubt in our minds that those numbers will remain or even increase when we start seeing statistics for 2015 and 2016.

These are not &#x201C;minor&#x201D; injuries, either. The article goes on to say that while sprains and broken bones are the most common types of trampoline-related injuries, ERs around the country are also seeing an increase in neck and skull fractures, which can lead to TBIs. Bouncers risk injuring themselves when they fall, when they are around other kids or when they try to exit the trampolines.
<h2>Keeping your kids safe while they jump</h2>
We understand the popularity of trampoline parks: bouncing around is fun. But we also see clearly as adults that which we could not see as kids &#x2013; namely, that the &#x201C;cool&#x201D; stuff we wanted to do to emulate our friends or our favorite Olympians can be really dangerous when you don&#x2019;t know what you are doing.

If your child is a fan of trampoline parks, keep these tips in mind to keep him or her safe:
<ul>
    <li>Always supervise your children, even if they are not jumping.</li>
    <li>Do not allow your child to try stunts like flips without proper guidance from a professional, such as coach or personal trainer.</li>
    <li>Makes sure your child has plenty of room to play, and move him or her to a less crowded space if more kids join the area.</li>
    <li>Protective gear is always an option, provided it is not disallowed by the park.</li>
    <li>Keep your children away from areas where adults are jumping.</li>
</ul>
If you are still on the fence about letting your child play at a trampoline park, there is some good news: the increase in injuries only relates to the parks, so your child may see less of a risk of injury on a home trampoline (provided you follow the same safety rules).

Crandall &amp; Pera Law providers comprehensive counsel for personal injury victims throughout Ohio and Kentucky. If your child sustained an injury while playing in a trampoline park, and that injury was the result of another person&#x2019;s negligence, we may be able to help you.

This is Steve&#x2019;s 3<sup>rd</sup> consecutive year being selected for his work in the areas of medical malpractice and personal injury. Being named to <a href="http://www.bestlawyers.com/"><em>Best Lawyers</em></a> is a true honor, because it is the &#x201C;oldest and most highly-respected peer review guide to the legal profession worldwide,&#x201D; and one of the few that rely solely on the opinions of not just our colleagues, but on the attorneys who face our team across the aisle every time we are in court.

This year there were more than 7.3 million nominees, which means that ultimately, fewer than 1% of all attorneys nominated for inclusion were actually selected. Here in Ohio, only a handful of attorneys were selected in the area of plaintiffs&#x2019; medical malpractice, proving once again what an extraordinary attorney Steve really is.
<h2>How the Best Lawyers process works</h2>
An attorney can be nominated for <em>Best Lawyers</em> by any third party &#x2013; colleagues, clients, judges, etc. &#x2013; and his or her work will be reviewed and evaluated by attorneys who hold the distinction of being on the list. Votes and scores are tallied, and only lawyers with the highest evaluations move on. Once they have been approved, <em>Best Lawyers</em> ensures that the nominee is in good standing with any local bar associations he or she may belong to. If the nominee is approved, then the group sends out notification to the firm.

The thing about <em>Best Lawyers</em> that is different from other objective ratings services is that inclusion one year does not guarantee inclusion the next. So while anyone nominated in 2017 will automatically be nominated in 2018, that attorney still has to prove him or herself worthy for the next publication. On top of that, an attorney cannot buy a place on the list: the only way to be selected is to earn it.

This is why we are excited for, but not at all surprised by, Steve Crandall&#x2019;s selection. His dedication to the pursuit of justice for his clients is virtually unparalleled. We could not be prouder.

Congratulations, Steve &#x2013; you deserve it!

In Ohio and in Kentucky, seatbelts have been mandatory since the mid-1980s, and both states have seen their laws regarding car and booster seats evolved through the years. But for all of our talk about child safety restraints, there is significantly less discussion about just how safe the back seat really is &#x2013; for children or for adult passengers. As it turns out, the rear seat passengers may be at risk of more serious injuries than you might think.

In 2015, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sitting-in-the-back-no-longer-the-safest-bet-for-all/">CBS News</a> reported that &#x201C;the car industry&apos;s focus has been on better protecting riders in the front because that&apos;s where most passengers, or roughly 88 percent, sit.&#x201D; Improvements have been made in airbag technology (Takata and Autoliv aside) and crumple zones, and even the design of the cars, all of which contribute to a safer drive or ride. However, the rear seats of a car or truck are not necessarily the safest place for adult passengers (even ones who wear their seatbelts). A study conducted by the Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that adults were more likely to sustain chest injuries; that women passengers might be more at risk of a head or neck injury; and that older rear-seat passengers faced an increased risk of dying in an auto accident. According to the <a href="http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/passenger-vehicles/2014">IIHS&#x2019;s independent website</a>, the exact number of rear seat fatalities in 2014 were:
<ul>
    <li>429 children (under the age of 13) in the second row, 35 in the third row</li>
    <li>342 children/adults (ages 13-19) in the second row, 9 in the third row</li>
    <li>871 adults (over the age of 20) in the second row, 76 in the third row</li>
</ul>
Almost all research turns up the same information: we must always wear our seatbelts, and we should consider purchasing cars with rear and side-impact airbags and technologies. For people who cannot run out and purchase a new car, however, here are a three <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/car-safety/how-safe-are-rear-seat-passengers.html">things to remember</a> when you get in the car:
<ol>
    <li>The safest rear seat is the one in the middle, so put your children there.</li>
    <li>Passengers over the age of 55 are at a greater risk of serious injury in the back seat, so let older passengers ride up front.</li>
    <li>Use a three-point harness as opposed to just a lap belt whenever one is available.</li>
</ol>

Marc has been <a href="http://www.americastop100attorneys.com/featured-initial-recipients.html">selected for his work</a> on behalf of medical malpractice and personal injury victims throughout Ohio.

Being named to such a list is <a href="http://www.americastop100attorneys.com/selection-methodology.html">no small feat</a>: &#x201C;Candidates for membership are initially identified through third-party research or peer nominations by other elite attorneys in the community.

If a candidate passes muster after such an extensive review, he or she may be offered a position on the list. Fewer than 1% of all practicing attorneys in the country will be afforded this honor.
<h2>Fighting for families</h2>
While all of us are thrilled that Marc was selected, we are not surprised. Marc Pera&#x2019;s dedication to, and compassion for, his clients is well-known throughout Ohio and Kentucky. In our offices, Marc has a bit of a reputation for being the nicest one &#x2013; but don&#x2019;t let his warm demeanor and friendly attitude fool you into thinking he isn&#x2019;t one of the most aggressive trial attorneys we know. An accomplished speaker and respected Adjunct Professor at Northern Kentucky University&#x2019;s Chase School of Law, Marc Pera&#x2019;s in-depth knowledge of the laws regarding patients&#x2019; and victims&#x2019; rights is formidable. His experience as a former insurance defense attorney means he can anticipate the moves his colleagues will make (often before they even make them), allowing him to build an airtight case for his clients.

Marc is motivated by the circumstances in which his clients find themselves. He knows that for some of the people he helps, their lives and their futures are on the line. His is consistently named as one of the Top 50 or Top 100 attorneys in Ohio by objective ratings services, including Super Lawyers, National Trial Lawyers, <em>Law and Politics</em> and <em>Cincinnati Magazine</em>. He serves on multiple committees and Boards for various legal associations, all while maintaining his Superb rating on Avvo and running the Cincinnati and Dayton offices of Crandall &amp; Pera Law.

No, we are not surprised by Marc&#x2019;s most recent award, though we are tickled to think he&#x2019;s reached &#x201C;Lifetime Achievement&#x201D; status. After all, as anyone who knows Marc can tell you, he&#x2019;s nowhere close to done yet.

Congratulations, Marc, on this most recent honor. You deserve it!

The signs of birth injury can occur immediately, such as when a child is delivered and requires resuscitation, or they can appear when a child is two or three years old and they&#x2019;re missing their developmental milestones, such as walking, talking or being able to feed themselves.

In both instances, an immediate investigation should be undertaken in order to allow us to get all of the medical records and ensure the hospital can provide the records before too much time has elapsed. In reality, the statute of limitations for a birth injury case expires on that child&#x2019;s 19<sup>th</sup> birthday, but you would never want to wait that long, simply because if I make a request immediately, I have a higher chance of getting those records to do the best investigation for you and your family.

&#xA0;

The birth of your child is supposed to a milestone in your life and a happy occasion for all. When healthcare professionals are negligent and your child is injured during birth, a happy occasion can be marred by the reality that your child faces a lifetime of medical care and assistance because of a professional mistake.

Birth injuries take many forms; some injuries occur because your delivery team made a bad decision that put your child in jeopardy. Others are more direct, like forceps and vacuum extractor injuries. Your baby needs constant monitoring before, during, and after labor. When medical professionals make mistakes at this crucial time, families are affected forever.

Birth injury isn&#x2019;t always straightforward, and proving that a birth injury was the result of medical negligence even three years after the fact can be difficult. The legal team at Crandall &amp; Pera Law has worked on both sides of these cases; we know what tactics healthcare providers and their insurers have at their disposal. Our experience gives you a better chance of winning a verdict or settlement that will help your family lead the best life they can.

If you believe that your child was the victim of a birth injury, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio birth injury lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve. Call our Ohio legal team at 877.686.8879, our Kentucky legal team at 877.651.7764, or contact us today for a free consultation.

If somebody were to ask me what are some of the elements that we consider when deciding whether or not to bring a case against a nursing home, I would explain to an individual that one of the primary factors that we look for is whether or not an individual has been abused and neglected.

In a nursing home setting, it&#x2019;s really quite different than the traditional malpractice, medical malpractice case, because the individuals in a nursing home are there for extended periods of time. And these individuals, often because they are at the end of life, have lost their independence. They are dependent upon the nursing home personnel to take care of all of their needs.

Oftentimes these people are unable to communicate whether those needs are being met or neglected. So when you look at a nursing home case, it&#x2019;s usually not a &#x201C;gotcha&#x201D; moment, here&#x2019;s a malpractice; it&#x2019;s more you have to look over the course of time &#x2013; weeks, months, and analyze the records to see if the person has been neglected, to see if they have been systematically abused over that period of time.

Oftentimes we see situations where people have developed bedsores that get worse and worse, and that can be indicative that the personnel at the nursing home weren&#x2019;t turning this person. In other words, moving them so they weren&#x2019;t sitting on the same place or lying on the same place of the body. Or that they&#x2019;re malnourished; they&#x2019;re not being given the food and nourishment they need to keep themselves healthy so that these sores don&#x2019;t develop.

Oftentimes we see in the records a deterioration of a person&#x2019;s mental status, and it&#x2019;s because they&#x2019;re not getting adequate nutrition or they&#x2019;re not getting the medications that doctors have prescribed to help keep them as healthy as possible. You have to look at these cases &#x2013; and usually there are thousands of pages of medical records &#x2013; very, very carefully. And that is something that Crandall &amp; Pera Law has the staff and the expertise to do as well as anybody.

We have nurses and lawyers that specialize in looking at nursing home cases and analyzing these records to determine whether abuse and neglect has occurred. Oftentimes, we don&#x2019;t get the real picture until a person leaves the nursing home, goes to another medical institution, and documents how resident truly appears, and oftentimes by then it&#x2019;s too late for that person.

Now, because people in nursing homes are at the end of life, they don&#x2019;t have lost income. They weren&#x2019;t looking at having 30 or 40 years and having children. They were at the end of life, so compensatory damages typically aren&#x2019;t that great in a nursing home case. They&#x2019;re not that high because the person didn&#x2019;t have much life left. Typically, in nursing home cases, we have an element of punitive damages. Because these nursing homes are owned by multi-billion dollar corporations, they are looking at a bottom line, and when we see signs of abuse and neglect in a resident, what we often find is that a nursing home is understaffed, and they don&#x2019;t have the proper staff to take care of a person&#x2019;s unique needs.

And they don&#x2019;t have that staff because, at a very high level, a corporate executive has made the decision that that nursing home doesn&#x2019;t need those extra funds, and the nursing home cuts staff. In the end, they cut care and your loved one is neglected or abused. At that point, when we find evidence of that, then we go to the court and we say look, we want punitive damages because this corporation needs to understand this cannot be tolerated. If we couldn&#x2019;t get punitive damages and it was just compensatory damages, it would just be a cost of doing business.

So if you believe a loved one of yours has been abused or neglected in a nursing home, give us a call at Crandall &amp; Pera Law. We will take a look at the case and give you an honest and educated opinion as to whether that has occurred. Oftentimes it hasn&#x2019;t, and people are at the end of life and they do deteriorate and die. But if you have any questions, give us a call and we will give you our opinion.

Nursing home negligence is a sad reality in Kentucky. It can be difficult for our aging loved ones to defend themselves or stand up for their rights, especially in the controlled environment of a long-term care facility. Nursing home negligence takes many forms, and proving that a healthcare provider was negligent can be time-consuming and difficult.

The elderly are at higher risk of abuse because they are easy targets. Your frail and forgetful loved one can be the victim of any kind of abuse, ranging from basic neglect to emotional, physical, financial, and even sexual abuse. Protecting you and your family from further harm is our first priority at Crandall &amp; Pera Law; serving justice is our mission.

The experienced Kentucky nursing home abuse and neglect attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can be your advocates during a difficult time. Our team of former healthcare defense attorneys and registered nurses can evaluate the circumstances of your loved ones care quickly and effectively.

If you believe that your loved one has been the victim of nursing home abuse or neglect, our Kentucky nursing home abuse attorneys can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

One of those risks is uterine rupture, which occurs when the walls of the uterus tear. It usually occurs at the incision site of a previous C-section, so mothers who wish to deliver their additional children naturally must be on the lookout.

Uterine tears are not necessarily caused by medical negligence in and of themselves &#x2013; but failing to warn a pregnant woman about her chances of sustaining the injury, and failing to adhere to a proper monitoring schedule, certainly are. Without the right care, a mother and her child can be at serious risk of injury.
<h2>Understanding the causes of uterine ruptures</h2>
Most women who suffer a uterine tear have had some kind of surgical procedure, with C-sections being the most common. However, if you have had fibroids removed, or had any kind of surgery on your uterus, you could be at increased risk. You might also experience a rupture if you sustained injuries in a car accident, or had to undergo an external cephalic version because your baby was in the breech position, or if the doctor made an error while using forceps in your previous delivery.

In some rare cases, a woman who has never had any procedures may also sustain a rupture. Women who have had multiple pregnancies or are carrying multiple babies, or whose labor has been prolonged, may also be injured.
<h2>Determining an act of obstetrical malpractice</h2>
<p class="p1">As we said earlier, the rupture itself is not usually the result of negligence (though failure to perform a C-section may be), but that does not mean that your doctor is not liable if you sustain an injury. Although there are other signs that may alert doctors and nurses to the possibility of a uterine rupture, they are not present in all cases, therefore, the most important sign is an abnormality in your baby&#x2019;s heart rate indicating fetal distress. Other signs may include:</p>

<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li1">Pain</li>
    <li class="li1">Vaginal bleeding</li>
    <li class="li1">Labor progress stops</li>
    <li class="li1">Rapid pulse</li>
    <li class="li1">Symptoms of shock</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you have undergone a C-section but are now attempting a vaginal birth, your OB/GYN and his or her team must constantly monitor the fetal heart rate. Failure to do so may lead to a delay in diagnosis.</p>
<p class="p1">Furthermore, it is your doctor&#x2019;s duty to inform you of the risks of giving birth naturally after you have had a C-section, especially because the increase risk of a rupture. Failure to diagnose a rupture can lead to</p>

<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li1">Severe blood loss and shock for the mother</li>
    <li class="li1">Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) if the uterus cannot be repaired</li>
    <li class="li1">Lack of oxygen and blood supply for the baby</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">A uterine rupture is a life-threatening situation for both the mother and her baby. The only treatment is immediate C-section in order to save the lives of mom and baby.</p>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The labor and delivery process can be complicated enough without the risk of additional injuries. A delay in diagnosis, a failure to monitor or inform, or the delay of a C-section can lead to permanent injuries &#x2013; to you or your baby.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5100" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Why-Commercial-Truck-Accidents-Almost-Always-Involve-Fatigued-Drivers-300x236.jpg" alt="Why Commercial Truck Accidents Almost Always Involve Fatigued Drivers" width="300" height="236">The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration announced a federal rule last year that will require the use of electronic logging devices to track truck driver duty status by December 2017. The use of electronic logging devices in place of written logs will increase log accuracy and driver accountability, and will prevent companies from interrupting drivers on mandated rest periods. The goal of the rule is to reduce the rate of commercial truck accidents resulting from overworked and fatigued drivers.

This <a href="http://www.overdriveonline.com/e-log-mandate-set-to-take-effect-dec-2017-rule-to-be-published-by-fmcsa-friday/">measure</a> is meant to enforce policies that have been enacted over the years, including a 2011 rule that changed the &#x201C;hours of service&#x201D; rules for truck drivers. That rule required a 30-minute break during the first 8 hours on the road and updated how a 34-hour &#x201C;restart&#x201D; rest period was used. It effectively reduced the maximum number of hours that commercial drivers spend on the road from 82 to 70 per week.
<h2>Why fatigue is so dangerous</h2>
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration:

&#x201C;Drowsy driving is a form of impaired driving that negatively affects a person&#x2019;s ability to drive safely. Most people associate impaired driving with alcohol or drugs, but in this situation, sleepiness is the primary cause. Drowsy driving is not just falling asleep at the wheel. Driver alertness, attention, reaction time, judgment and decision-making are all compromised leading to a greater chance of crashing. According to NHTSA&#x2019;s National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Study (NMVCCS), drowsy drivers involved in a crash are twice as likely to make performance errors as compared to drivers who are not fatigued. In extreme cases, a drowsy driver may fall asleep at the wheel.&#x201D;

A 2016 report from the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160310125330.htm">National Academy of Sciences</a> estimates that 10 to 20% of approximately 4,000 fatalities resulting from truck and bus crashes every year involved fatigued drivers. There is no test for drowsiness, so the true number of accidents caused by drowsy driving is unknown; estimates range from 5,000 to 8,000 deaths resulting from around 1.2 million crashes each year, but the numbers could be much higher.
<h2>Why has it taken so long enforce mandated rest periods?</h2>
The hours of service rules were changed in 2011, but with paper logs and the push for more money, the accuracy of self-reporting was highly suspect. By the time e-logs are required, six years will have elapsed between the reduction of hours on the road and an accurate method of enforcement. The simple explanation is that the National Transportation Safety Board, which studies traffic crashes, programs, and technologies, has no regulatory whatsoever. The board can simply make recommendations to regulatory agencies, which <a href="http://www.overdriveonline.com/action-on-driver-fatigue-health-distractions-among-ntsbs-2016-most-wanted-regulations/">it does often</a> and to seemingly little effect.

To illustrate just how often the agency is ignored, <a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/news/transportation/technology-that-could-curb-truck-deaths-is-mired-i/npRNN/">consider this</a>: the NTSB recommended that the Department of Transportation investigate a new collision avoidance technology and determine whether the device could reduce accidents. The recommendation was to make the life-saving technology mandatory in commercial vehicles if it was determined to be effective. That recommendation was made <em>over twenty years ago</em>, in 1995<em>.</em> Last November, the House Rules Committee refused to amend a transportation policy bill to mandate the technology in commercial trucks, despite its growing prevalence in passenger vehicles.

The refusal of government agencies to implement life-saving technologies despite proof of effectiveness verges on criminal. Thousands of lives have been needlessly lost, and families will continue to suffer until these issues are properly addressed. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight for the rights of accident victims every day. If you or a loved one was injured in a commercial truck crash, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries and property damage. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio commercial truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5103" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dealing-with-the-Aftermath-of-an-Injury-While-You-Are-on-Vacation-300x200.jpg" alt="Dealing with the Aftermath of an Injury While You Are on Vacation" width="300" height="200">Now that the weather has gotten a little cooler, many people will start thinking about taking their final vacations of the year. Maybe you are renting a home at a lake, or planning on eating your way through Tuscany, or counting down the days until you sail off to the islands on a cruise. No matter what kind of vacation you planned, you may find yourself facing serious complications if you are injured while on vacation.

The very first thing you should do if you sustain an injury, or come down with an illness, is to seek medical attention. Your medical records will be a vital part of any claim for compensation, regardless of whether you go to trial or work out a settlement. You should also file a police report, no matter which country you are in, as you will need it to corroborate your claim.
<h2>What about insurance?</h2>
If you are traveling within the U.S., and you get into an auto accident, then your car insurance should protect you. Your health insurance may also cover a portion of the costs for your care at an out-of-state hospital. But what if you are traveling by sea or by air, or if you are going abroad?

One way you can help protect yourself is by purchasing travel insurance. Depending on the package you purchase (and from whom you purchase it), you could be covered for everything from lost luggage to travel assistance to medical expenses. If you are renting a car, take the added insurance package offered from the rental company, just in case.
<h2>Complications while at sea</h2>
If your big summer plans include a cruise, please remember that transport vessels are subject to maritime (or Admiralty) laws &#x2013; a very complex and specific area of the law. Be sure to review your contract before you sign on to see if you are prohibited from filing a claim in the event of a medical emergency, or if the statute of limitations to file that claim are different than they are in your home state. For example, in Kentucky you generally have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLq62bkOqc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one year from the date</a> that the injury occurred (or should have been discovered through reasonable care) to file a medical malpractice claim; Ohio also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNDpb0AYiUU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gives you one year</a>, though there are exceptions for this time limit in both cases. If you are subject to medical negligence on a cruise ship, you may have far less time.

Keep this in mind, too: when you are vacationing on a resort, on a cruise or in another country, it can be virtually impossible to track down witnesses to your injury in the weeks following your return home. If you can get other tourists to give statements to the police, do so. Otherwise, ask their permission to record their accounts on your phone, laptop or tablet, and keep those files safe so your personal injury attorney can hear them. Exchange information with the witnesses and whomever caused your injury if possible.

Whether you vacation locally or across the world, you want to be prepared in case the worst happens. If you do sustain an injury while on vacation, you can trust the skilled Kentucky and Ohio personal injury attorneys of Crandall &amp; Pera Law to look out for your best interests. To find out more about what we do, or to schedule a free consultation at one of our office locations, please call our Ohio team at 877.686.8879, our Kentucky team at 877.651.7764, or fill out this contact form.

On September 17, 2016, however, three semi-trucks ended up crashing into one another. <a href="http://wkbn.com/2016/09/17/multi-vehicle-crash-closes-part-of-interstate-80/">WKBN 27</a> quoted Ohio State Highway Patrol Sgt. Tom Homrighausen as saying &#x201C;One vehicle that was in the right lane struck the vehicle in the left lane, causing both vehicles to hydroplane, cross the medians into the westbound lanes of traffic. As they did, they both overturned,&#x201D; and then a third truck &#x2013; which tried to brake in time but could not &#x2013; ended up colliding with the first two vehicles and breaking open the trailer.

Miraculously, only two of the people involved in the accident sustained injuries: truck driver Duane Borgelt of Beaverdam, Ohio and Mississippi resident James Van Norman, who was a passenger in Borgelt&#x2019;s truck. The initial cause of the accident is still unknown (WFMJ says they &#x201C;<a href="http://www.wfmj.com/story/33121382/i-80-westbound-closed-at-the-ohio-pennsylvania-line">tapped</a>&#x201D; each other), though the driver of the third truck, Samuel Magee, &#x201C;was issued a failure to control citation.&#x201D;
<h2>A bad accident that could have been much, much worse</h2>
Commercial truck accidents are serious business. In the I-80 crash this weekend, the force of their hit was enough to flip both trucks onto their sides. Had such a collision involved passenger vehicles, the chances are good that more people would have ended up in the hospital with injuries. An accident with a commercial truck on a busy Ohio interstate like I-80 could lead to:
<ul>
    <li>Spinal cord injuries, including partial or full paralysis</li>
    <li>Traumatic brain injuries</li>
    <li>Neck and skull fractures</li>
    <li>Organ and soft tissue damage</li>
    <li>Loss of limb</li>
    <li>Permanent loss of vision and hearing</li>
</ul>
Under the most tragic circumstances, drivers or passengers could have died in such an accident.

The news report cites Sgt. Homrighausen as saying the trucks hydroplaned &#x2013; which means the I-80 was wet, at least in the area of Hubbard. If there was enough water on the ground, it could have hidden potholes, missing pieces of tarmac or uneven roadway, and there may have been debris in the road that was difficult to see. Between the poor weather conditions and the almost inevitable panic that would have set in as the driver lost control, the truck accident could have been far worse.

We wish the injured driver and passenger a speedy recovery.

In April, Uber offered to pay $100 million to settle two class action lawsuits filed by drivers in California and Massachusetts, who &#x201C;charged that the drivers should be treated as employees, rather than independent contractors. That would have entitled the drivers to a variety of benefits, including overtime and health insurance. It also might have put Uber on the hook for some of the drivers&#x2019; expenses, such as gas and tolls,&#x201D; as reported by <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/19/technology/uber-drivers-class-action-settlement/">CNN.com</a>.

A federal judge has rejected the settlement offer, claiming the amount was too little to properly compensate the drivers. In his order, Judge Edward Chen claimed that &quot;The court cannot find that the settlement is fair and adequate,&quot; as the majority of plaintiffs would have received fewer than $100 a piece from the settlement. Uber will need to either revise its settlement amount, or the cases will have to go to trial.

This decision &#x2013; go to trial or settle the case &#x2013; is one that all auto accident victims may have to face eventually. It is not an easy decision to make, either: most of the time, you or your loved one has just sustained an injury, is facing mounting medical bills and potential lost wages, and may be dealing with the extensive loss of personal property, or the tragedy of losing a loved one. As auto accident attorneys, one of our duties is to explain to you the pros and cons of a settlement and of a trial, and to advise you about your realistic options and expectations for both. While class action lawsuits are different from individual lawsuits, ultimately the plaintiffs must decide what is best for them and their futures, and proceed from there.
<h2>The benefits of settling a case</h2>
Let us first look at some of the benefits of settling your personal injury case. What many of our past clients have liked about settling is how much more quickly the process comes to an end. Remember that a defendant &#x2013; whether in a civil case or a criminal case &#x2013; rarely <em>wants</em> to be a defendant; most people prefer to avoid a trial, and may offer you a settlement amount for that reason. If you are unhappy with the amount, or if you and your attorney deem it unfair, you can negotiate for a more just number.

Along with less time, settlements often mean fewer expenses. Fewer legal expenses means more money in your pocket when all is said and done &#x2013; and often, that compensation comes more quickly than it would if you win at trial.

Finally, you will know from the beginning just how much compensation you will receive &#x2013; and the amount may remain private, which means you can keep your business your own.
<h2>When a jury trial is the better option</h2>
Sometimes, a trial is the better option for a client. As experienced trial attorneys, we can tell right away when out client has been offered an unfair or unjust settlement &#x2013; and we know how to handle your case if the opposing counsel refuses to see reason. Our experiences as former medical malpractice defense attorneys in Ohio and Kentucky give us an advantage here, because we can view a case from the other side&#x2019;s perspective, and eliminate any issues that might arise in the course of a trial or negotiation before we start.

The truth is, no lawyer worth his or her salt will take a case to a jury that she or she believes is not winnable. Therefore, if your lawyer believes you should go to trial, or agrees to take your case to trial as per your request, then the chances are good your case is strong to start.

A lot of preparation is done for these types of cases. Yes, it can be time consuming and costly, but not for you &#x2013; those expenses are paid by the firm, and you may not be responsible for them unless you win. Furthermore, a trial will be public record. If you are injured by a defective auto product, or because of a drunk driver, etc., the responsible party will be held accountable publicly for his or her actions.

Finally, a trial may lead to a much larger compensatory number than a settlement. In cases where your injury is truly catastrophic, you may obtain both compensatory damages (economic and non-economic) and punitive damages &#x2013; another way to hold a party responsible.

Every case is different, and you should always review the pros and cons of your individual case with your lawyer. If you believe that a trial may be necessary, make sure to work with an experienced Kentucky or Ohio trial attorney who can handle any complications or complexities that come your way.

If you have sustained an injury in a crash or collision as the result of another person&#x2019;s negligence, Crandall &amp; Pera Law wants to help you protect your family and your future.

Three very important areas to look at whenever you&#x2019;re evaluating wrongful death would be misdiagnosis of a heart attack, misdiagnosis of cancer, or medication error. Let&#x2019;s talk about misdiagnosis first.

Once of the most important evaluations in misdiagnosis is for a nationally recognized attorney to look at your medical records, as well as your X-rays. In many cases, what is <em>not</em> known is that the physicians could have diagnosed your heart attack or especially your cancer, many months or ever years before it was diagnosed.

Another area of wrongful death to examine is medication errors. There are literally tens of thousands of medication errors that occur throughout the country every year. They would include medication errors that occur when you are in the hospital, as well as when you receive your medication from a pharmacy. Medication errors can cause wrongful death, brain damage and other severe injury. Did medical negligence lead to your loved one&#x2018;s death?

Losing a loved one is always heartbreaking, but finding out that medical negligence played a role in the death of that person can be devastating. Misdiagnosis and medication errors are among the leading causes of wrongful death, but you may also have a claim if your loved one died as a result of:
<ul>
    <li>Surgical mistakes</li>
    <li>Failure to monitor a patient</li>
    <li>Undiagnosed infections</li>
    <li>Defective medical devices or drugs</li>
    <li>Anesthesia errors</li>
    <li>Improper behavior by a doctor</li>
</ul>
In complex medical malpractice cases like these, you want an award-winning law firm on your side to help you seek justice. Crandall &amp; Pera Law was founded by three former medical malpractice defense attorneys in Ohio and Kentucky. Each founding member has the experience and skills to anticipate problems before they arise, and to build a case built on solid evidence and documentation. Because the attorneys know how to dismantle a medical negligence case, they are able to shore up any &#x201C;holes&#x201D; and create a stronger case for their clients.

If you have lost a loved one because of medical negligence, you may have a claim for wrongful death. Let Crandall &amp; Pera Law protect your interests, and help you protect your family.

Considering that up to 10,000 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with the condition <a href="http://www.cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/prevalence-and-incidence">every year</a>, a significant number of families are affected by medical errors in serious, potentially devastating, ways.
<h2>CP is a life-long condition</h2>
A child diagnosed with cerebral palsy has that diagnosis for life. There are treatments available to help with the symptoms, but no cure. Thankfully, many people with cerebral palsy go on to live &#x201C;normal&#x201D; lives; they go to school, they go to work, and they start families of their own. Because CP is not a progressive condition, there is no worry that the person&#x2019;s brain function will deteriorate any further. For some victims, however, the condition is so severe that they require assistive technologies to help them, like wheelchairs or respirators, and some will never be able to feed, clothe or bathe themselves, necessitating a lifetime of caregiving services.
<h2>Medical errors that may lead to cerebral palsy</h2>
The type of brain damage that &#x201C;triggers&#x201D; the release of chemicals which can lead to cerebral palsy, as the NIH puts it, can be caused by trauma. When that trauma is the result of the actions (or inaction) of a negligent healthcare provider, you may be able to claim medical negligence as the cause of your child&#x2019;s CP. Some of the medical errors that could lead to the condition include:
<ul>
    <li>Failure to properly monitor the vital signs of the mother and fetus pre-term</li>
    <li>Failure to diagnose and subsequently treat an infection</li>
    <li>Improper use of forceps or a vacuum extractor</li>
    <li>Failure to diagnose an Rh incompatibility</li>
    <li>Failure to diagnose and respond to signs of fetal stress</li>
    <li>Penetrating brain injuries during labor or during a C-section</li>
</ul>
If you are unsure whether or not your child&#x2019;s cerebral palsy was the result of medical negligence, speaking with an experienced birth injury attorney may help you. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our attorneys review medical documentation with our on-staff Registered Nurses, and document evidence that may prove negligence. We understand that you&#x2019;re fighting for your child&#x2019;s future. Let us help with that fight.

BODY:
My firm is Crandall &amp; Pera Law &#x2013; and the two things I emphasize about our firm are, first of all, all three lead partners have been defense lawyers in the past, and together we tried hundreds of cases on the defense side. Why is that important? We know how to win a case for the defense; we know how to poke holes in the patient, or plaintiff&#x2019;s, case.

The second thing is that each of us have specialized in medical malpractice for several decades. Each of the three main partners in Crandall &amp; Pera Law have handled medical malpractice cases from both the defense and plaintiff&#x2019;s side. We&#x2019;re national recognized medical malpractice plaintiffs&#x2019; lawyers. We know the medicine almost as good as the physicians that we&#x2019;re going against. We have paralegals who are trained in looking at the medical records, organizing the medical records, and we also have a board of nationally recognized medical experts that we consult with. And because we&#x2019;ve been on both sides of the fence, we put the case together in its best and most successful form to get good results.
<h2>You want an attorney who knows how the other side works</h2>
When you are fighting for your future after an act of medical negligence has hurt you or your loved one, you need an experienced attorney who has a long history of proven results. Steve Crandall began his career as a lawyer defending doctors and hospitals, and therefore knows how these forces think. This experience has allowed Steve Crandall to know how to &#x201C;poke holes&#x201D; in a plaintiff&#x2019;s case. Having training and experience on the defense side first allows the lawyers of Crandall &amp; Pera Law to anticipate any issues that might arise in your case before they happen during trial or settlement negotiations, and to eliminate the holes from the beginning. It also allows the attorneys to prepare clients more effectively and thoroughly for how the defense will structure their arguments against your case.

Having experienced paralegals and Registered Nurses on your side works to your benefit, too. The professional staff at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can answer your questions and explain in detail what your medical records say. They work hand-in-hand with your medical malpractice lawyer to ensure that you understand what is happening at every step of the case, and to collect and document the evidence you need for a strong claim for compensation.

If you or your loved one has been a victim of medical negligence in Ohio or Kentucky, Crandall &amp; Pera Law is ready to help. They are your advocates for a better and brighter future.

Steve was also selected as one of the Top 5 attorneys in Cleveland as well as being listed in the Top 100 Attorneys in Ohio, something he has accomplished consistently since 2009.

Steve can add these new accolades to his long list of awards. He has been recognized over the years for his skills and his successful track record by numerous objecting ratings services, including Ohio Super Lawyers, National Trial Lawyers, U.S News &amp; World Report&#x2019;s <em>Best Lawyers</em>&#xAE;, and the American Institute of Personal Injury Attorneys. He also maintains his AV-Preeminent Rating by Martindale-Hubbell, with a perfect score of 5/5, as well as a perfect score of 10/10 on Avvo, who lists him as a &#x201C;Pro.&#x201D;

This latest dual award is exciting, of course, but not surprising to those of us who know and work with Steve very day. His passion, drive and experience are what allow him to continue to win large jury verdicts and settlements on behalf of medical malpractice and personal injury victims in Ohio. As a Board Certified Civil Trial Attorney, Steve understands how important preparation is to building a successful case. That is why he prepares those cases for trial from the start.

But he also knows that his role as an attorney demands more than preparing and presenting a case. It means taking the time to really bond with his clients, and to build long-term relationships with them. When you are hurt, frustrated, angry or frightened, you need someone you can believe in &#x2013; and who believes in you. Steve Crandall walks his clients through the process of bringing a claim, answers their questions and assuages their fears &#x2013; and celebrates their joys and victories, too. It&#x2019;s no wonder that so many of his clients can&#x2019;t stop talking about their experiences with him at the helm.

Super Lawyers reviews tens of thousands of nominations every year to create their Top Lists. It comes as no surprise to us that Steve Crandall would be given a place on so many of them.

Congratulations, Steve, on your Top 10, Top 5 and Top 100 Super Lawyers selection &#x2013; you deserve it!

They had received free tickets for seats behind the first base dugout. The players in the first base dugout were protected by safety netting, but the young boy and his mother, sitting just a few feet away, were not. A foul ball struck the boy in the head; the high-speed projectile caused severe, traumatic brain injury.

The family has incurred more than $350,000 in medical expenses on behalf of their young son, who has undergone multiple brain surgeries and is permanently disabled. They retained Crandall &amp; Pera Law&apos;s own Marc Pera to represent them.

<a href="http://local12.com/news/local/boy-with-brain-injury-sues-baseball-team-after-hit-by-ball">WKRC Cincinnati&#x2019;s Local 12</a> reported, &#x201C;The Dayton Dragons tickets have a warning on the back, just like other team tickets including the Reds. In very small print it said the ticket holder assumed all risk of being injured by thrown bats or thrown balls. <strong>Attorney Pera said that didn&apos;t warn of the risk of sitting right behind the dugout </strong>[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][emphasis ours]. The suit included a baseball study. It showed if within a hundred feet of home plate a ball comes at a person 90 miles an hour it is going to hit a person in less than a second.&#x201D;
<h2>We fight for justice</h2>
At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we work hard to protect the innocent and help families get back to normal. The lives of a small boy and his family were altered forever two summers ago at a minor league baseball game, an accident that never should have happened. Now, a young boy has been denied a full life and a young family faces a lifetime of medical care.

Our clients aren&#x2019;t just numbers. They are real people who have been seriously hurt and need help getting their lives back on track.

A report titled &#x201C;<a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/09/15/peds.2016-2396">Codeine: Time to Say &#x2018;No&#x2019;</a>&#x201D; will appear in the October issue of <em>Pediatrics; </em>it shows &#x201C;continued use of the drug in pediatric settings despite growing evidence linking the common painkiller to life-threatening or fatal breathing reactions,&#x201D; according to the AAP.

Doctors prescribe codeine for pain. Any child who has had his or her tonsils, adenoids or wisdom teeth removed is likely to have been given the drug. You can also find it in over-the-counter medicines like cough syrups. More than half the states in the country allow OTC medications with codeine: Kentucky and Ohio are among them.
<h2>Dangers associated with codeine</h2>
Codeine use can also lead to respiratory depression, a rare but potentially fatal condition. A doctor explains it like this in a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/codeine-not-safe-children_us_57e195c7e4b0e28b2b50bdec">Huffington Post</a> piece:

&#x201C;Codeine is a &#x2018;prodrug,&#x2019; which means it needs our bodies to become active. When people take a medication with codeine, enzymes in their livers transform codeine into a morphine-derivative to dull down pain&#x2026; But every body is different and, for some, that enzyme can be overactive, creating too much of the morphine-derivative. This, in turn, can slow down breathing and respiratory function and even lead to death&#x2026;. Children are specifically less capable of metabolizing codeine than adults because the enzyme changes as the body matures into adulthood.&#x201D;

In sum, codeine breaks down differently depending on the person. Some people will feel little to no relief, which might prompt an accidental overdose; others might metabolize the drug too quickly, leading to severe respiratory distress. The only way to determine how much of the enzyme is present in your child&#x2019;s body is to have his or her blood tested in a lab.

The elephant in the room, of course, is that codeine can be abused easily. Dextromethorphan, or DXM, is found in many cough syrups. <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cough-cold-medicine-abuse">DrugAbuse.gov</a> tells us it &#x201C;may produce euphoria and dissociative effects or even hallucinations when taken in quantities greater than the recommended therapeutic dose.&#x201D; The effects of abuse or an overdose may include:
<ul>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Impaired motor function</li>
    <li>A feeling of numbness</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
    <li>Increased heart rates</li>
    <li>Increased blood pressure</li>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Extreme agitation</li>
    <li>Hypoxic brain damage</li>
    <li>Death</li>
</ul>
There are a number of other pain relievers out on the market that <em>do not</em> have these types of effects, or the potential to lead to addiction. As the AAP points out, parents and doctors have other choices: it is time to exercise them.

At the moment, states are responsible for regulating drivers, while the federal government regulates automakers, requiring safety features and handling defective vehicles. The question everywhere is whether the onboard software that operates driverless vehicles qualifies as a safety feature or as a driver.
<h2>Preventing future problems</h2>
The policy paper from the Transportation Secretary is intended to prevent patchwork legislation from creating massive obstacles to the emerging technology. Test vehicles in different states have already spurred local rules in California, Nevada, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania with more on the way. Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who is at the forefront of driverless car innovations, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/federal-officials-plan-aggressive-approach-to-driverless-cars/2016/09/19/3e78411e-7e92-11e6-8d0c-fb6c00c90481_story.html"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, &#x201C;This could be a nightmare, if you drive across a state border in an autonomous vehicle.&#x201D;

Creating legislation to deal with driverless cars is no easy task. <em>The Washington Post</em> reported, &#x201C;The Department of Transportation opted to describe the document as &#x2018;guidance&#x2019; for the industry and state officials, both out of caution and for a practical reason... Federal officials worried the premature regulation of that technology might inhibit its development. They also realized the ponderous process to produce an official federal rule &#x2014; it&#x2019;s not uncommon for it to take five years &#x2014; could leave them with something already outdated before it saw the light of day.&#x201D;
<h2>The heart of the machine</h2>
In addition to the timing, solving the question of liability in an accident is no small feat. At the heart of the dilemma is the impossible question; if a lethal collision between two parties is unavoidable, which party should the computer choose to protect? When a family member dies because an automated vehicle made a decision, who can be held responsible? Is road safety ultimately going to wind up in the hands of software engineers, or will they hide behind the code that ultimately makes the decision? These are the types of questions that will face our legislators in the coming years, and they will not be easy to answer.

While advancing technology ultimately makes our world safer, developing those technologies carries an inherent risk. Before GPS navigation improved, drivers found themselves turning off bridges or driving into lakes. Smartphones, despite their capabilities, interrupt drivers on a regular basis, causing minor and major accidents alike. Onboard information centers in vehicles are more distracting than they are helpful. Each of these technologies is wonderful when it works properly, but potentially deadly during development.

At the moment, distracted driving is our biggest challenge. In 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, 10% of all fatal crashes and 18% of all injury crashes were caused by distracted driving, according to the <a href="http://www.distraction.gov/downloads/pdfs/Distracted_Driving_2013_Research_note.pdf">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.

If a distracted driver injured you or your loved one, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky auto accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

The AIOPIA is part of the American Institute of Legal Counsel, an objective ratings service which believes &#x201C;that Attorneys should be recognized for excellence in their field and that potential Clients can benefit from this knowledge.&#x201D;

In order to be selected for this honor, applicants &#x2013; who can only be nominated by another attorney, a client or the Institute itself &#x2013; must demonstrate not only their successes in courtrooms or boardrooms, but also that those successes are beneficial to their clients above all other things. There are specific criteria that the AIOLC reviews when considering an applicant. The attorney must:
<ul>
    <li>Have a 10/10 client satisfaction rating</li>
    <li>Be considered a &#x201C;top rated&#x201D; attorney by other ratings systems</li>
    <li>Be an industry leader</li>
    <li>Have no unresolved complaints against him or her</li>
</ul>
The AIOLC also looks at applicants&#x2019; awards and accolades, speaking engagements and publications, which associations they belong to, and their continuing levels of education.

Over the past couple of years, the group has grown enough to offer 10 Best Client Satisfaction awards for attorneys across the country, and practicing in 14 different areas of the law.

This is Marc&#x2019;s second consecutive year being selected for membership for the group for Western Ohio, and we could not be prouder of him if we tried. Marc is not only a skilled and aggressive attorney, but he is also a genuinely empathetic man, who cares deeply about his clients and their families. So it is really no surprise that Marc would win yet another award for his dedication and service to his clients &#x2013; from the AIOPIA or from any group. He works hard on behalf of his clients, and he is willing and able to keep fighting for them until he knows that justice has been served.

Congratulations again, Marc, on your second year membership to the American Institute of Personal Injury Attorneys &#x2013; you deserve it!

What&#x2019;s unique about birth trauma is an evaluation of two kinds of cases; one is brachial plexus, and one is brain damage. Brachial plexus cases refer to injuries that occur to the nerves of the child as it is being delivered. Generally speaking, the physician who delivers the child places too much traction on the baby&#x2019;s head as it&#x2019;s being delivered, and it damages the nerves that control the baby&#x2019;s arms.

Brain damage is slightly different. We look at the prenatal records, and we see how the course of your labor went. Typically what happens is that there are warning signs during the delivery that the physician does not see or appreciate. Instead of doing a Cesarean section and delivering the child early, they allow the labor to progress and unfortunately that leads to lack of oxygen. When the baby is delivered, we find out the baby has suffered brain damage.

If someone is trying to evaluate a birth injury case, it is very important to first of all go to a lawyer who specializes in birth trauma and birth injury. It has to be a lawyer who is able to look at the prenatal records, but the most important aspect is for the lawyer to consult with an expert witness to look at what are called electronic fetal monitoring strips. Those are the strips that are on the side of the bed that show the baby&#x2019;s heart rate, and show the contraction pattern. An expert can see warning signs that if a physician does not look at or see can result in birth injury.

In addition to brachial plexus and brain damage, there&#x2019;s another area of birth trauma that should be evaluated, and that is fractured skulls or direct trauma to the brain. How that occurs is during the labor period, if a woman has the natural forces of labor and the baby is getting hung up and cannot be delivered, the forces of labor can actually pound the skull of the baby and cause brain damage or fractures of the skull. Again, a nationally renowned birth trauma attorney can look at the prenatal records, the delivery records, as well as the fetal monitoring strips to see if a type of damage like that has occurred.

Birth trauma can have a variety of causes, but the most significant effects are on you and your family. When your doctor fails to properly oversee your pregnancy, labor and delivery, your family can be affected forever. Sometimes, the symptoms of birth trauma are apparent immediately. Alternatively, it may take many months for an injury to come to light; in both cases, there is no substitute for the experienced Kentucky and Ohio birth trauma attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law.
<h2>Birth trauma by the numbers</h2>
Injuries during labor, delivery and infancy are far more common than we like to think. We wrote about the numbers last December, but they bear repeating. The most recent data available was from 2006; it showed:
<ul>
    <li>Nearly 157,700 avoidable injuries to mothers and newborns occurred during childbirth that year.</li>
    <li>Newborns covered by Medicaid had worse (higher) rates of injury than newborns covered by private insurance, though wealth did not appear to play a role in the difference in rates.</li>
    <li>Vaginal births with instruments accounted for the highest injury rates.</li>
</ul>
Healthcare professionals train for years to learn how to handle complications during labor and delivery. When trained and trusted professionals make mistakes, the consequences can last a lifetime. If your child has suffered complications from a birth trauma or birth injury, your family may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio birth trauma attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

Crandall &amp; Pera Law is extremely proud of our selection as a Tier One firm, the top ranking provided by <em>U.S. News-Best Lawyers</em>.

In order to be eligible for selection, at least one attorney from the firm must be named to the annual <em>Best Lawyers</em>&#xAE; list in the given practice area. Then, <a href="http://bestlawfirms.usnews.com/methodology.aspx"><em>U.S. News &#x2013; Best Lawyers</em> asks</a> clients &#x201C;to provide feedback on firm practice groups, addressing expertise, responsiveness, understanding of a business and its needs, cost-effectiveness, civility, and whether they would refer another client to the firm.&#x201D; They also ask other attorneys to vote on the nominated firm&#x2019;s &#x201C;expertise, responsiveness, integrity, cost-effectiveness, whether they would refer a matter to a firm, and whether they consider a firm a worthy competitor.&#x201D;

This information, combined with feedback form the attorneys, as well as data regarding the &#x201C;landscape surrounding the nationally ranked practice area,&#x201D; is what helped to create the overall score for the firm. The tiers are then based off what percentage of firms got within the highest scoring firms overall.

A commercial truck driven by 28-year-old Devin Harris of Illinois had left the roadway and rolled down an embankment. Harris was trapped in the cab, and was transported by medical helicopter to Grant Medical Center in Columbus after being extracted by the Coalton Fire Department.
<h2>Hazardous cargo causes mandatory shutdown</h2>
While the fire department worked to extricate Harris, concern was growing among first responders; the heavily damaged tanker was full of a volatile chemical called vinylpyridine. While no leaks were apparent, residents within a half-mile of the accident were advised of the incident, and the Ohio Department of Transportation shutdown Route 35 in both directions. The shutdown remained in effect for more than a day until a recovery team that could handle the chemical was located.

The Telegram reported:

&#x201C;Jackson County Emergency Management Agency Director Robert Czechlewski&#x2026; considered this the most potentially dangerous situation the local HazMat team has dealt with in the last 28 years. He said the tank holding the estimated 35,000 gallons of the chemical did not rupture, but was heavily damaged.&#xA0; &#x2018;This is a highly corrosive and flammable chemical,&#x2019; Czechlewski reported from then scene where he and many others were up all night. &#x2018;This chemical is so dangerous that a lot of the contracting companies don&apos;t want to touch it. The chemical is in a container, which was smashed, but didn&apos;t rupture. It will have to be pumped from the tank and hauled away.&#x2019;&#x201D;
<h2>Big trucks hauling hazardous materials are a danger to everyone</h2>
Thankfully, the tank did not rupture, the driver survived, and the wreck was cleared. However, the danger that the accident posed is undeniable; vinylpyridine is corrosive to the human respiratory tract. Had the unthinkable happened, dozens of first responders and nearby residents could have been killed. Big trucks and their dangerous cargo are an undeniable hazard on our roads.

If you or your loved one has been injured after a commercial truck collision or exposure to hazardous cargo, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries and lost wages. The experienced Ohio truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

However, children face a disproportionate risk of medication error when compared to the rest of the population, primarily because even minor dosing errors can have major effects on their small bodies. The true scope of the problem is difficult to measure, not only because &#x201C;error&#x201D; can mean different things, but also because a mistake can happen at any point from prescription to ingestion and involve multiple people.

Small mistakes mean big problems

<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/sick-children-face-potentially-deadly-danger-medication-errors-1474855500">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported, &#x201C;Part of the problem, health professionals say, is that dosing is often based on a child&#x2019;s weight, which can lead to calculation errors. Some liquid medications only come in concentrations suitable for adults, so the pharmacist may have to dilute it for a child. And a parent measuring a dose may use a spoon or something else on hand, instead of a specialized tool to pull the correct amount.&#x201D;

Compounding the difficulties in calculating and administering medication is the continuing growth and chemical changes that children undergo. Dosages must be recalculated almost constantly, especially for more dangerous compounds. In worst-case scenarios, children can die from an unintentional overdose. In others, like we wrote recently, they may simply wind up with a chemical dependency from something as mundane as Tylenol with codeine, an opioid-based drug.

Healthcare providers are working on solutions that range from allowing physicians to send medication orders directly to IV infusion pumps to alarms that alert nurses and doctors when a setting is outside the normal range for a particular patient. However, when it comes to medicating children, small and common math errors pose big problems for these young patients.
<h2>The scope of the problem</h2>
The following information from <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819776-overview#a6">Medscape</a> illustrates just how disproportionately medication errors affect children. Pediatricians are prescribing a drug called Clonidine that is extremely effective in treating certain neurological problems. In 2014, there were 5063 total reports of toxic exposures to Clonidine. Of these, almost 75% occurred in children under 19, and almost half of those exposures occurred in children under 6.

Dangerous drugs can hurt more than they help, especially when your child&#x2019;s doctor or pediatrician is negligent. If your child has been injured or fallen ill after a medication mistake, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky medical negligence attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

Birth injury encompasses a lot of injuries that occur to a child. Most people think birth injury simply means brain damage, and it certainly does. When a child is born and they start to miss developmental milestones, they can&apos;t talk in the timeframe that they should, the child can&apos;t walk or feed themselves, then people begin to investigate what occurred to the child.

Many times what we find is that a lack of oxygen during birth is what led to that brain damage. But birth injury also encompasses and includes what&apos;s called shoulder dystocia. That simply means that a child is being born, and that child is larger or heavier than would fit through their mother&apos;s birth canal. And what occurs in that instance is, nerve damage in and around their neck and shoulder area leads to what&apos;s called brachial plexus injury. What we found is that occurs not simply because the baby was larger than the doctor anticipated, but because the obstetrician actually places too much traction on the babies head when it&apos;s being delivered, and that&apos;s negligence.&#xA0;We can determine that from reviewing the records.

The second injury is brain damage, and that can occur two ways. If physician does not deliver a child timely, they have a lack of oxygen to their brain and that leads to brain damage. And secondly, brain damage can occur if a physician gives too much medication to the mom while laboring, causing contractions that are too close together. That trauma can actually also cause brain damage, so it&#x2019;s very important to look at the records, determine the type of injuries that can occur and whether or not it was the result of medical negligence.
<h2>The many types of birth injury</h2>
Childbirth is a complex process, and injuries or trauma that occur before, during or after childbirth can have lifelong consequences. Pregnancy involves a large number of medical professionals who must act as a team to relay relevant information at all stages. When one link in the information chain is broken, the consequences can affect your child and your family forever.

There are a number of complications that can arise during labor and delivery, all of which require a medical team to respond quickly and appropriately. Complications and trauma can occur at every stage of pregnancy, labor, delivery and infancy. The most common types of birth injuries at different stages can include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prenatal negligence.</strong> When screening or testing for certain medical conditions is conducted improperly or not at all, both mother and child are exposed to unnecessary health risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Labor and delivery negligence.</strong> When healthcare professionals fail to monitor vital signs or notice a problem, labor can be delayed and the vital supply of oxygen to the infant can be cut off, resulting in permanent brain damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Negligent use of medical devices or drugs during delivery</strong>. When tools like forceps, vacuum extractors or drugs are used or administered improperly, permanent damage can occur.</li>
    <li><strong>Postpartum negligence.</strong> When healthcare professionals fail to adequately monitor a newborn, life-threatening health issues can cause long-term disability or even death.</li>
</ul>
If your child was injured through negligence at any stage of your pregnancy, labor, delivery or post-partum care, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Ohio birth injury attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

Whenever clients come for an evaluation of medical malpractice, one of the most important things that they may not be aware of is that their care provider can be altering their written chart as well as their computer chart while they are still in the hospital. So one of the things that needs to happen, is that your records are evaluated both internally as well as forensic document and computer experts. Through those evaluations, oftentimes we find that your care providers were not only negligent, but they were altering your records to try to hide it....

Almost any type of care you receive generates tremendous amounts of paperwork, often written in dense medical jargon and accompanied by codes for billing, referrals and prescriptions. The more complicated the treatment, the more paperwork it generates; deciphering the paper trail can seem utterly impossible, especially with the physical and emotional toll of hospitalization or other care.

When you or your loved one require medical care, just understanding the options and preparing for treatment can be daunting. Realizing when mistakes are made can be difficult, especially because medical mistakes have a high psychological and emotional toll on victims and their families. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio medical malpractice lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law have built a team uniquely suited to review and evaluate medical records for fraud.

When it comes to your health, your medical records are just as important as the medications you take and the treatment you receive. The documents that make up your record provide a log of the steps taken by your healthcare providers and an overall snapshot of important details about you. When those records are compromised, your life is on the line.

If you believe that your or your loved one was injured because a healthcare professional lied, you may be entitled to compensation for injuries, lost wages and other damages. For a free evaluation with an attorney from Crandall &amp; Pera Law, please call 877.686.8879 to reach our experienced Ohio team, 877.651.7764 for our legal team in Kentucky, or fill out our <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact </a>form.

Randy Walters was on his way to work when he saw the big rig leave the road, roll over and catch fire. He stopped and helped the driver, Mark Cosgrove, out of the cab. Cosgrove told Walters he was hauling over 8,000 gallons of gasoline; both men ran as far as possible.

Hazardous cargo creates hazardous conditions

The overturned tractor-trailer was leaking liquid gasoline, and the fire had just begun as the men got away unscathed. While no one was injured, first responders had a significant problem on their hands; namely, a small fire that was about to become a big one. Fire crews were several miles west of the crash, and could not get through the combined traffic created by the accident and ongoing road construction. The fire was in a bad place.

WKBN 27 reported:

&#x201C;Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers, local police and the Ohio Department of Transportation quickly shut down the interstate as well as highways leading into the area, allowing firefighters from nearly a dozen departments to get to the scene, carrying water and chemical foam to dowse the flames. But just when crews thought they had things under control, the fire re-started. &#x2019;When the guys were spraying down the frame of the truck, it made the foam go away and exposed it again and reignited,&#x2019; said Chief Birch. By 10:30 a.m., the fire was finally out, but it burned two trucks and a car left behind.&#x201D;

The accident happened around 6 a.m.; it took nearly four and a half hours for the fire to burn off nearly all of the gasoline the truck had been carrying. Hazmat crews were called to erect dams to prevent the dangerous chemical foam from running off into storm drains and ditches. The fire burned so long and hotly that the asphalt will have to be removed and replaced before the road is safe to use again.

I-80 construction and big rigs are a recipe for disaster

Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Brian Holt said that construction in the area increased the number of crashes the department has seen; a second tractor-trailer rolled off the highway that same day, less than ten miles away. Construction zones are creating dangerous conditions for drivers that are rife with distractions. Throw in big rigs carrying hazardous cargo, and taking a ride on I-80 can mean taking your life in your hands.

Big trucks cause big accidents, and big accidents cause serious injuries. If you or your loved one has been injured in a commercial truck accident, you may be entitled

to compensation for your injuries and lost wages. The experienced Ohio commercial truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve. Call 877.686.8879 or <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact us</a> today for a free consultation.

Warm fires, turkeys shellacked to a high gloss, mountains of mashed potatoes and dozens of sides conjure feelings of coziness and warmth and satisfaction of being overstuffed in an overstuffed chair. Unfortunately, all that comfort and bliss comes at a high cost.

The US <a href="http://onsafety.cpsc.gov/blog/2015/12/07/tis-the-season-to-decorate-safely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> reported 12 fatalities and an estimated 14,500 emergency rooms visits in November and December of 2014, and those numbers are only the result of holiday <em>decorations</em>. The holidays don&#x2019;t just host family gatherings; they also hold a host large and small risks that threaten your family during the holiday season, like these excerpted from <a href="http://health.alot.com/wellness/10-ways-that-thanksgiving-dinner-can-kill-you--9975/?s=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Health.com</a>:
<ul>
    <li>That generous spread looks appetizing, but it&#x2019;s full of tricky bones and giblets floating ominously in the gravy boat. Choking can be deadly, but serious injuries can affect those who survive, including a lacerated trachea or perforated bowel.</li>
    <li><strong>Food allergy/food poisoning<em>.</em></strong> Allergies can develop at any time in your life, which means that Aunt Mary&#x2019;s famous pecan pie that you&#x2019;ve enjoyed every year since you can remember might prove to be your undoing. Knowing your allergies and asking about ingredients might save your life, so make sure to keep a list on your person (in case of a reaction), and carry an Epi-pen if you have a prescription for one.</li>
    <li><strong>Heart attack<em>.</em></strong> Eating high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sodium foods in excess can leave you dangerously dehydrated. That thicker blood, coupled with the blood pressure spike from listening to 8-year-old Tommy&#x2019;s 45-minute drum solo, can put you in the emergency room if you&#x2019;re not careful. Drink some extra water, avoid alcohol, and try to eat in moderation when you can.</li>
    <li><strong>Burns/Smoke Inhalation<em>.</em></strong> Between the miles of electrical cabling, the 400-degree oven, the tea light centerpiece, the overloaded circuits and the roaring fireplace, fire is a very real risk. Inhaling smoke or toxic fumes from burning plastic or insulation can end a meal with a trip to the emergency room for the whole family. A misplaced dish towel can lead to a kitchen fire within minutes. Make sure all small children are safely in the other room when you&#x2019;re cooking, and supervised at all times.</li>
    <li><strong>Auto accidents<em>.</em></strong> Last, but not least, everyone is rushing around to pick up those final ingredients or make it home for dinner in time. Maybe you realized last minute that you forgot the cranberry sauce, or that you misread the invitation. No matter what the reason, stay calm, keep to the speed limit, and be patient &#x2013; everyone else wants to get home, too.</li>
    <li><strong>Drunk drivers.</strong> We cannot stress this enough: do not drink and drive. Do not let your loved ones drink and drive. If you can avoid driving at all, do so, because you cannot stop others from doing the wrong thing. Drunk drivers are a menace on the road, contributing to needless deaths, catastrophic injuries and untold amounts of property damage. Please be safe and be smart.</li>
</ul>
At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we hope you won&#x2019;t need our services this holiday season, but we want you to know that we&#x2019;re here for you when you need us. From our family to yours, have a safe and happy Thanksgiving, and remember that our experienced Kentucky and Ohio personal injury lawyers will fight for you and yours when the unthinkable happens.

The results confirm the message that the CLF has been promoting for years; that all football players, at all levels, are at risk of the developing the neuro-degenerative disease.

Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the CLF, told <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2016/10/19/college-football-programs-and-concussions/92415908/">USA Today</a>, &#x201C;This information is being released to raise awareness that CTE is not just an issue for professional football players. The data should not be interpreted to say that players from these schools are at greater risk than other college players. Instead, the data shows the widespread reach of this disease, and the commitment by the alumni and their families of these schools to support CTE research by participating in brain donation.&#x201D;
<h2>Knowing the signs of a concussion can help your loved ones</h2>
Unfortunately, there is no test for CTE; the only way to confirm diagnosis is by brain dissection after death. However, knowing the signs and symptoms of concussion can potentially save players and their families from the effects of CTE. The disease is more likely to develop in those who suffer repeated head trauma, and is exacerbated by not allowing that trauma to fully heal before another injury occurs. Knowing these signs and symptoms can keep players on the sidelines until it&#x2019;s safe to be on the field again:
<ul>
    <li>Headache or neck pain</li>
    <li>Nausea, tinnitus, dizziness, or tiredness</li>
    <li>Feeling dazed or not your normal self</li>
    <li>Trouble walking or sleeping</li>
    <li>Weakness, numbness or decreased coordination</li>
    <li>Repeated vomiting or nausea</li>
    <li>Confusion</li>
    <li>Slurred Speech</li>
    <li>Seizure</li>
</ul>
If someone you know is experiencing these symptoms and the symptoms are not going away, seek immediate medical treatment. Everyone should seek medical clearance to return to normal activities after a head trauma. Even mild traumatic brain injury can have devastating and permanent effects; it&#x2019;s not worth taking a chance.

When your loved one suffers a traumatic brain injury, your life can change forever in an instant.

Surgical errors in the evaluation of medical negligence is important, but here&#x2019;s the most important thing: individuals comes after they&#x2019;ve had a bad surgery. There&#x2019;s a bad result. That doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean there&#x2019;s medical negligence. You have to get the medical records, and look at the anesthesia records, and especially the surgical records: the operative report. That will tell you whether or not you had simply a bad outcome &#x2013; which does occur &#x2013; or whether the surgeon or the anesthesiologist in the case, were negligent, leading to that bad result. But until you look at the medical records, you&#x2019;re not sure if it&#x2019;s bad results or negligence, which is often the case.

Surgeons make mistakes more often than you might think. If the error is caught quickly, fixed immediately, and leads to no lasting effects, you may not be able to make a claim for compensation. That is because a successful medical malpractice claim must prove:
<ol>
    <li>The doctor owed a duty of care to the patient.</li>
    <li>The doctor behaved negligently, or failed to live up to that duty of care.</li>
    <li>The failure or breach of duty was responsible for the injuries sustained by the patient.</li>

BODY:
Having been an attorney since 1994, I&#x2019;ve worked in just about all 88 counties in Ohio. I&apos;m also licensed in Kentucky. Throughout those years, I&apos;ve had an opportunity to meet and work with plenty of fine families. I&apos;ve also been fortunate enough to have a number of verdicts and settlements on behalf of those families. For example in Lucas County, I have the largest medical negligence verdict there, in excess of $10 million. I also have the largest verdict or settlement in at least four other counties in the state of Ohio, and in 2014 I had what is believed to be the largest personal injury settlement in a construction law case that occurred in Franklin County.

The most important thing that I can do, and this is something that I tell my clients, I wish I could get in the time machine and go backwards and have prevented their injuries from occurring. Unfortunately I can&apos;t do that. But what I can do is provide the compensation to give them the best medical care, and most importantly, I can provide the compensation that hopefully prevents this from occurring to any other family again. Having talked about the verdicts and settlements the question is really, to you, what does that mean? It means two very important things. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law we spend the time to investigate the case, to get to know you and your family, but most importantly it means we&#x2019;re willing to fight to the very end; whether it&apos;s settlement or whether we have to go to trial, spend the time and energy to prove your case to a jury and obtain those types of verdicts and settlements that you see on our website.

A good lawyer can change your life. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we work hard to resolve every case as quickly and effectively as possible because we want our clients to get the answers they want and need. All three of our partners are former malpractice defense attorneys, so we know what to expect in and out of the courtroom.

Using our experience, we have built a dedicated team of Kentucky and Ohio injury attorneys, registered nurses, and medical malpractice attorneys that can comprehensively evaluate your case and help your family get the help they need and deserve. Our team knows what it takes to win in the courtroom; our record of impressive courtroom victories and some of the largest settlements ever achieved in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia sets our firm apart from the rest

Massive medical companies and the big insurance companies that defend them have the resources to file endless motions and injunctions to delay trying your case. We know that your resources aren&#x2019;t endless, and that you can&#x2019;t wait for the money you deserve to take care of your family. That&#x2019;s why we fight for you every day and work hard to make sure your case is resolved as quickly as possible.

If you or your loved one has been a victim of medical malpractice, contact the experienced Kentucky and Ohio medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law today. We can help your family get the justice and compensation they deserve.

Emerging technologies and stricter approval requirements first added crumple zones and airbags and later introduced seatbelt warning sensors; now, cars that drive and stop themselves are poised to become a reality in the next few years. With all those safety improvements, highway fatalities have been in steady decline for more than forty years, but not anymore.
<h2>The tide is turning</h2>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/business/tech-distractions-blamed-for-rise-in-traffic-fatalities.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a> reported recently that &#x201C;highway fatalities last year recorded the largest annual percentage increase in 50 years. And the numbers so far this year are even worse. In the first six months of 2016, highway deaths jumped 10.4 percent, to 17,775, from the comparable period of 2015.&#x201D;

The culprit? More distraction than ever. Smartphones that contain an ever-expanding library of available apps are being linked into vehicle systems like Ford Motor&#x2019;s Sync, Apple&#x2019;s CarPlay and Google&#x2019;s Android Auto. These systems purport to make driving safer by making smartphone interaction hands-free, but these selfsame systems may be increasing our level of distraction instead of decreasing it.
<h2>More new tech may hurt instead of help</h2>
When was the last time you used a voice command on a phone or tablet that you didn&#x2019;t have to repeat or clarify? Bluetooth connections can take forever, and interacting with your car&#x2019;s voice command system takes your eyes off the road far more often than it works flawlessly. Lawmakers are additionally concerned that emerging technologies like Tesla&#x2019;s Autopilot may create a false sense of security in already distracted drivers.

At the moment, distracted driving is a secondary offense for adults, which means that law enforcement must cite an initial cause for a traffic stop. What this means for your family is that the law cannot protect you from distracted drivers. However, there are options when a distracted driver injures you or your loved one. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio auto accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

If you hire me as your lawyer, my goal is to change your perception of lawyers. The reason why I believe I am unique as a plaintiff&#x2019;s attorney is that I have been an attorney on the defense side and the plaintiff&#x2019;s side. When I started my career back in 1994, I defended physicians, hospitals and corporations, and was a defense attorney. I tried dozens of cases as a defense attorney, and as a result I believe I have discovered how those defense attorneys think, how the corporations and doctors are going to try to beat you as the plaintiff.

Now that I&apos;m on the plaintiff&#x2019;s side, I&#x2019;m taking all that experience in the courtroom and in the conference room and board rooms where the defendants meet to talk about trial strategy, and through that experience I believe I am able to represent you and provide you with the experience and success that you deserve.

If you come to Crandall &amp; Pera Law, certainly you will work with individuals at the law firm that include paralegals, nurse paralegals and other lawyers. But, if we decide to go ahead with your case and I am your lawyer, you will work with me. You will have my cell phone and you can call me, you can email me, you can certainly send me text messages throughout the day. Being accessible, communicating and working together will lead to the success of your litigation.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our partners are all former defense attorneys for big healthcare companies and the big insurance companies that represent them. Our experience gives us insight and the ability to anticipate how a hospital, physician or insurer will attempt to fight your case. After years of litigating for the defense in the courtroom, we have acquired the skills and knowledge necessary to successfully defend a plaintiff&#x2019;s case at trial.

We work with you from the beginning to truly understand all the details of your case; that&#x2019;s why we hired a dedicated team of paralegals and nursing paralegals that help us gather and review all the documentation relevant to your case. Our team is uniquely structured to be able to quickly and effectively evaluate medical cases and determine the best solution for you.

Everyone&#x2019;s experience with Crandall &amp; Pera Law is different, and that&#x2019;s because we take the time to address the details of <em>your</em> case. Each case is unique because each person is unique, and our team works with you to answer your questions and make sure you get the results you want and deserve.

We are here to fight big business and big insurance companies, but more importantly, we are here to answer your questions and make a difficult experience as painless and accessible as possible.

Sepsis, oftentimes we see it as a missed diagnosis following an abdominal surgery. Any time someone operates on your bowel, which is full of all kinds of nasty bugs, one of the risks is that you get an infection, and then you become septic. So anytime you have abdominal surgery, a physician following you after that surgery needs to be acutely aware of the signs and symptoms of sepsis because you were already at risk. They just cut on your bowel, and if that place they sewed back together doesn&#x2019;t hold, bacteria get out.

If you&#x2019;ve had diverticulitis, which is just pockets of your bowel that become infected and inflamed, and those little pockets that stand out from your bowel and if they rupture, they just release bowel contents into your body, feces. And guess what? Your body reacts, and you develop SIRS, and they&#x2019;ve got to get in there and they&#x2019;ve got to fix it. Even if they fix that, guess what, for the next week they should be watching you carefully to make sure that you don&#x2019;t become septic again.

Postoperatively is one of the big times that you will see patients develop sepsis, but you could be working out, you know, out on a farm or whatever, have a really bad cut, ignore it. For whatever reason that bacteria gets into your bloodstream and you develop SIRS and suddenly you&#x2019;re sitting at home and you&#x2019;re panting, and you&#x2019;ve got a bad fever and your heart&#x2019;s racing, well you need to get into a doctor. You show that doctor that festering cut, and they look at you and go well the heart rate&#x2019;s above 90, the respiratory rate&#x2019;s above 20, he&#x2019;s got a fever of 102, he&#x2019;s got a festering cut right there, it should be a pretty easy diagnosis. Unfortunately though, sometimes medical care providers miss it.

When your body responds to an infection, the response can have serious consequences. The <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sepsis/home/ovc-20169784">Mayo Clinic</a> says, &#x201C;Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. Sepsis occurs when chemicals released into the bloodstream to fight the infection trigger inflammatory responses throughout the body. This inflammation can trigger a cascade of changes that can damage multiple organ systems, causing them to fail.&#x201D;
<h2>SIRS &amp; Sepsis</h2>
Any wound can become septic without proper treatment, but sepsis is far more likely to be the result of a bowel perforation from a foreign object or surgery. This is simply because the thin layer of tissue in the bowel is all that separates your body from the outside world of food &amp; waste. When that layer is torn even slightly, infection happens rapidly and attacks vulnerable internal organs quickly.

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is one of the first symptoms of sepsis. It is a sign that your body is fighting an infection, but SIRS can cause a host of problems that seem unrelated to the infection and compromise the normal function of other organs and organ systems.

The criteria for diagnosing sepsis is fairly straightforward; an infection must be known or suspected, and a patient must have two of these three symptoms:
<ul>
    <li>Body temperature above 101&#xB0;F or below 96.8&#xB0;F</li>
    <li>Heart rate above 90 beats per minute</li>
    <li>Respiratory rate higher than 20 breaths per minute</li>
</ul>
The longer sepsis goes untreated, the more devastating the consequences. Risk of sepsis is higher after a cut or surgery, especially abdominal surgery. Sepsis may be among the worst of all missed diagnoses because it progresses so rapidly and should be an obvious consideration in postoperative diagnoses.

If your loved one suffered complications from sepsis or SIRS after any surgery, you may be the victim of medical malpractice. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you need for medical bills, lost wages and other damages.

They told the people that lawyers and juries were out of control, and that placing caps on the amount of damages a person can collect in a civil suit would lead to &#x201C;a fair, predictable system of civil justice.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s predictable, all right: now, people who have been grievously injured, who may need medical care or counseling or life-altering therapies and household adaptations, can predict exactly when they&#x2019;ll be on their own to pay for those things out of pocket.

In the years that followed, Ohioans have suffered over and over and over again because of tort reform. A recent case, <em>Simpkins v. Grace Brethren</em>,&#xA0;shows just how awful the effects of tort reform can be. In short, because of these laws, a child who was repeatedly raped by a church pastor was denied a fair and just settlement. Tort reform at its finest, it appears.

Crandall &amp; Pera Law co-founder Marc Pera explains in detail just why tort reform is so dangerous and damaging to victims in this <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/12/20/ohio-tort-reform-helps-protect-rapists/95527218/">letter published by the <em>Cincinnati Enquirer</em></a>. We encourage you to read it, and to reach out to your legislators and representatives to demand the repeal of tort reform in Ohio. All it&#x2019;s done is allow those who hurt others to go largely unpunished, while taking money and treatments out of the hands of the people who need them the most &#x2013; the victims.

The hospital claims that this is because different agreements are worked out with different insurance companies, but in reality it is the best and most profitable system for the healthcare industry. The simple answer should be that an MRI machine costs so much to buy, staff, and maintain, and those costs are spread out over an average number of patients. The reality is that there is often no answer until your insurance coverage is confirmed.

While this is behavior we have come to expect from hospitals and doctors (who base their pricing under the guise of covering the exorbitant and rising cost of malpractice insurance they are required to carry because of overly litigious patients), we wouldn&#x2019;t expect the same type of behavior from our neighborhood pharmacy. After all, the cost of a pill is the same to everyone; there is a definite production cost, an expected markup, and that&#x2019;s the end. Unless, that is, you choose Walgreens as your pharmacy of choice.

<a href="http://www.khou.com/news/health/why-does-walgreens-charge-1237-more-than-costco/357124547">KHOU.com</a> published a story in late November that detailed one woman&#x2019;s experience with her husband&#x2019;s recent Alzheimer&#x2019;s diagnosis. Corinne and her husband Ken left the doctor&#x2019;s office with the devastating diagnosis and a prescription for Donepezil, a drug that increases cognition and behavior but doesn&#x2019;t cure or slow the disease. Ken&#x2019;s Medicare doesn&#x2019;t cover prescription drugs, so Corinne was prepared to pay cash for the 30 tablets &#x2013; but not for the amount she was charged.

A month&#x2019;s supply of Donepezil at Walgreens cost the couple $198.80 with no insurance subsidy. When Corinne started questioning how the medication could be so expensive, she began shopping around. Not long after, she found the same amount of the drug, a month&#x2019;s supply, cost a mere $14.87. Walgreens charged the couple <strong>1,237% more than a competitor</strong> just down the road.
<h2>How can this happen?</h2>
As usual, it comes down to insurance and greed: &#x201C;Most customers of the major chain drug stores have insurance, and insurance companies negotiate prices that are discounted from a store&#x2019;s list price. Therefore, the chains attach the list price to a rocket and launch it skyward &#x2014; and to heck with the poor schlubs like Corrine, who pay out of pocket.&#x201D; The article concludes that Walgreens isn&#x2019;t actually at the corner of healthy and happy; instead, it&#x2019;s at the intersection of &#x201C;Highway&#x201D; and &#x201C;Robbery.&#x201D;

Corrine contacted Walgreens and received no explanation, but she was offered a full refund. Those of us who don&#x2019;t check, or don&#x2019;t have time to check, end up being price-gouged &#x2013; and we simply carry on, grumbling about the prices without discovering that we have been had. The friendly neighborhood pharmacy turns out to be not-so-friendly after all. A Walgreens spokesman defended the company by saying that 97% of patients use some form of insurance, but that shouldn&#x2019;t mean the other 3% get raked over the coals.

Pricing is a major issue in the field of healthcare, and negligent or unethical business practices can harm your family just as much as negligent or unethical care. If your loved one has suffered in any way from the negligence of a healthcare professional, you may be entitled to compensation. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

The driver, who has strong roots in the community, was shaken but not injured. The truck itself rolled over, leading to a considerable traffic jam at the time.

Cargo spills get a lot of attention in the lighter section of the news; puns are fun, and we&#x2019;ve been guilty of our fair share in the past. Just this past June, we wrote about some of the strangest commercial truck cargo spills we&#x2019;ve ever come across. We enjoyed that list ourselves, but the real effects of commercial cargo spills are no laughing matter; the resulting road conditions can have catastrophic consequences for you and your loved ones.

Oddly enough, it was around this time last year that we wrote about the big risks of big tire blowouts. That post described how commercial trucks often use retreaded tires to save money, and how those retreaded tires are far more likely to fail at highway speeds than new tires. Exploding tires directly <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-rig-fatal-accidents-linked-driving-trucks-over-75-mph-top-speed/">caused 223 deaths</a> between 2009 and 2013. We talked about how those tires behave on big rigs, but never discussed the impact a tire explosion at highway speeds could have on smaller (but still big) commercial vehicles.

The fact that no one was injured is truly extraordinary, especially considering that even this smaller commercial truck could have caused serious damage to any passenger vehicle in its path, and led to serious injuries for the passengers themselves. When any component of a big truck fails, the consequences can be dire for other motorists. Insurance is designed to protect you when accidents happen, but sometimes it isn&#x2019;t enough to cover all of the damages. When it isn&#x2019;t, you&#x2019;ll need a skilled truck accident attorney to help fight for you.

Experienced legal counsel is designed to protect you from what happens after an accident. When you are left with significant bills or injuries after an accident, you may be entitled to compensation for those bills, lost wages, continuing care or other damages. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio commercial truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

When a client comes to me to have a medical negligence case evaluated, the first and most important thing is that they need answers. A lot of times people come for an evaluation and they&#x2019;ve had a bad result, but they don&#x2019;t know what happened. The care provider hasn&#x2019;t told them what happened. So initially, I think the goal is to get records and I think provide an explanation to the family what happened.

They always ask me, well what is medical negligence? And it&#x2019;s pretty simple; there&#x2019;s an expected way care providers are supposed to act. That&#x2019;s called the standard of care. If the care provider has acted below that, then they&#x2019;re negligent. We both provide the answer and then give them the evaluation of whether there&#x2019;s negligence or not.

Once you establish negligence, that&#x2019;s not the end of the evaluation. You also have to prove causation and damages. The easiest way to look at causation is, did that bad care directly cause the injury? In most cases, it did, but we have to evaluate that question. And then lastly, for a malpractice case to be successful, there has to be significant damages. In order for a jury to react to your case, it has to be a case involving wrongful death, paralysis, brain injury, or the loss of a limb.

In a legal sense, negligence is a failure to use reasonable care that results in injury or damages to another. Simply put, reasonable care means that most people with the same qualifications would have acted a certain way in a given situation. When healthcare providers fail to provide a reasonable standard of care, the consequences are more serious than in other professions because healthcare providers care for people.

Establishing medical negligence isn&#x2019;t as straightforward as it might seem. In some cases, like abdominal surgeries, a certain amount of risk is inherent in the procedure. In order for an action to be considered negligent, your healthcare provider must have committed a gross error or failed to adhere to established protocols before, during or after your surgery. Retaining experienced legal counsel after a botched procedure or diagnosis will help you get the answers you need as quickly as possible.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our experienced team of medical and legal professionals is uniquely suited to evaluate the circumstances of your case and to help you take the legal steps necessary to recover. If you believe that you or a loved one has been a victim of medical negligence, our Kentucky and Ohio medical malpractice and medical negligence lawyers can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you need.

The slings and arrows continued to fly right up until the very end, making for a Christmas miracle that one Ohio family will never forget.
<h2>An un-survivable accident</h2>
Just two days before Christmas, first responders were called to an early morning crash site in Luzerne Country involving a tractor-trailer wreck and vehicle entrapment. WNEP 16 reported, &#x201C;As... [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][Hanover Township Fire Chief Joe Temarantz] drove his ambulance down Nuangola hill towards the scene of the wreck, he saw tire tracks, twisted metal, and shredded rubber all over the road. He later learned that the car that was wedged beneath the tractor trailer was dragged for more than a quarter of a mile.&#x201D;

The trail of debris strewn across the highway led first responders to expect the worst, but when they arrived, the mangled car was empty. The family of four sitting on a nearby embankment were not onlookers; the parents and two young children were in the accidents. They had escaped certain death almost entirely unscathed; all four were released from a nearby hospital just hours later. Chief Temarantz remembered the father telling his child not to worry about the Christmas presents inside the car because their real present had just happened.
<h2>The impossible can happen</h2>
This particular underride crash was unusual mostly because the victims survived at all. When a passenger vehicle travels under a tractor-trailer at highway speeds, catastrophic injuries and death are the most common results. The guards design to prevent underride incursion have caused decapitation and penetration injuries, and the other forces involved have caused brain and spinal cord injuries and bone and tissue damage that are either fatal or require a lifetime of rehabilitation.

This family of four truly experienced a Christmas miracle; it&#x2019;s uncommon for the victims of commercial truck accidents to walk away at all, let alone with nary a scratch. More often, families lose loved ones or watch them cling to life as medical professionals struggle to repair severe injuries. When accidents affect your family, there is no substitute for experienced legal counsel. The qualified Kentucky and Ohio commercial truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help your family get the compensation they deserve.

A birth injury case starts with one of the most dreaded things in anyone&#x2019;s life and that is an injury to a child. But what people don&apos;t realize initially is that injury to the child could actually have happened during the various stages of the pregnancy. So, an evaluation of the prenatal period, which is before the delivery occurs, as well as during the labor and delivery and even after the baby is born, that evaluation has to take place from start to finish.

Anytime a family comes to me for investigation of a birth injury case, the electronic fetal monitoring strips are very important. Initially, when you look at these strips, and they&apos;re actually records that are created during the labor and delivery process, it shows the baby&#x2019;s heart rate, it shows Mom&#x2019;s contraction pattern. When you first look at them they look complicated. But actually when you sit down and review them with a family, you see that it is very common sense.

It shows the baby&#x2019;s heart rate, so you can evaluate whether the baby is healthy, whether the baby is undergoing distress during the labor such that the doctor should intervene. It also shows Mom&#x2019;s contraction pattern, so you can also see if the contractions were strong, whether they are adequate, or whether there are too many of those contractions, which can also affect the baby.

So when I sit down with the baby family and review the electronic fetal monitoring strips themselves, they can actually see what occurred during the labor and delivery and they can get the answers to what happened to their baby by reviewing those strips together.

A birth injury is something that no one parent wants to think about. When a birth injury affects your family, it can be difficult to think, let alone consider that your child&#x2019;s injury may have been the result of a mistake made by a healthcare provider that you trusted. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our team of medical and legal professionals on Ohio and Kentucky have the experience to evaluate your case and help you get through a difficult time. We fight for your family when you need us most.
<h2>We get the answers you need</h2>
The first step in evaluating a birth injury is examining the medical records of treatment and testing from conception to delivery. Our team is uniquely suited to examine complicated medical records and determine whether procedure was followed, even when complications necessitated alternative treatment. We examine every facet of every stage of pregnancy, labor, delivery postpartum and neonatal care, and we make sure that negligent care providers are held accountable. Most importantly, we review our findings with you and keep you involved at every stage.

If your child suffered a birth injury that resulted in temporary or permanent effects, it&#x2019;s easy to believe that your doctor and hospital did everything they could to prevent injury; sadly, that&#x2019;s not always the case. When your child suffers a birth injury, a professional legal review of the medical records can reveal problems and prevent mistakes from happening again. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky birth injury lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you need to pay for medical bills and continuing care.

We talk about distracted driving all the time because the evidence is plain; studies have found that texting and driving is just as dangerous as driving under the influence. Now it appears that fatigued driving should join the dynamic duo of distracted and drunk driving to become the terrible trifecta. New data suggests that all three conditions contribute to roughly the same number of crashes.

It gets worse NPR News reported:

&#x201C;A report released Tuesday by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety suggests that drivers who sleep only five or six hours in a 24-hour period are twice as likely to crash as drivers who get seven hours of sleep or more.

And the less sleep the person behind the wheel gets, the higher the crash rate, according to the findings. For instance, drivers in the study who got only four or five hours of shut-eye had four times the crash rate &#x2014; close to what&apos;s seen among drunken drivers.&#x201D;

We just recently talked about how distracted driving caused the biggest spike in highway fatalities in fifty years. In the first six months of 2016, highway fatalities were up more than 10 percent from the same period in 2015, when more than 35,000 people died on the road. Our nations roadways are no longer getting safer. Instead, lack of attention, lack of sleep, and poor judgment are increasing the risks for drivers everywhere.

How to stay safe

Fortunately, there&#x2019;s good news for the chronically busy. You can catch up on lost sleep, but only to a point. The point, of course, is within the same day. If you sleep for four hours and then nap later during the same 24-hour period, you&#x2019;re generally in the clear. Unfortunately, the only way to catch up on sleep after the day resets is to get the rest your body needs. If you begin to feel fatigued on long drives or after a long day, the report suggests pulling over for a quick 10- or 20-minute nap; that break could be the difference between life and death.

Auto and truck accidents change lives in an instant. New data is pouring in all the time that tells us how many are affected and what the contributing causes are, but all that information makes the same point; driving requires our full attention all of the time. One mistake, even at low speeds, can kill. Unfortunately, being a safe driver doesn&#x2019;t mean that everyone else is taking the same precaution.

If you or your loved one has been a victim of a distracted, drunk, or fatigued driver, you may be entitled to compensation for medical bills, lost wages and other damages. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky auto accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

Well, one of the things that makes Crandall &amp; Pera Law especially unique is the fact that we have three full time registered nurses on staff. There&#x2019;s one that works in northern Ohio, one that works in southern Ohio, and one that works out of Kentucky, and these registered nurses are our employees and they help us analyze the cases.

One of our nurses in particular, in southern Ohio, Camille Harlan, is also a lawyer. She litigates with the partners these cases and she was a clinician for a number of years before she decided to back to law school and get her law degree and is an invaluable asset to Crandall &amp; Pera Law in the evaluation and the litigation of cases. Myself in Kentucky, Martha Soling is my right hand. I&#x2019;ve know Martha for 24 years, since I started out; she was a clinician for a number of years before she became a legal nurse assistant and she worked on the defense side, much the same way I did, for a large percentage of her career, and then joined me when we formed Crandall &amp; Pera Law. Martha is invaluable in looking at cases and helping analyze them for determining whether there was malpractice.

Something that they have that I don&#x2019;t have is that they actually worked in a hospital setting; they worked in an ICU &#x2013; they went into the operating room and handed doctors the instruments and watched them actually cut into people&#x2019;s bodies and operate on them. That&#x2019;s an insight and an experience that I don&#x2019;t have, and so it is invaluable for me and for my clients to have somebody like that look at their case and they can apply that insight and let us know was this a reasonable outcome or is this likely as a result of malpractice.

In addition, the nurses with Crandall &amp; Pera Law are invaluable because they do medical research. Susan, I can tell you, is an incredible writer and also researcher. I mean, she can look at a medical record and figure out exactly what the primary issue is. They are incredible assets to us and the wonderful thing for our clients is that they&#x2019;re just part of the fee. When you go to other law firms &#x2013; not all of them, but a lot of them &#x2013; nurses aren&#x2019;t on staff; they will contact nurses and they will ask the nurses to help them out in the case but then those nurses&#x2019; time is billed as an expense in addition to the fee. That&#x2019;s something we don&#x2019;t do; we work with the nurses and the nurses work with us on an everyday basis, and I would never want to expense their time to a client. They are part of our team. So when you hire Crandall &amp; Pera Law you don&#x2019;t just get Mark, Steve, Ron and the associates that work with us, but you also get those three nurses; registered nurses, who have years of clinical experience between them looking at your case and helping to decide it merits.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our nursing staff is an essential part of our team. Our registered nurses have extensive experience with healthcare procedures and facilities, insurance practices and medical records and billing. Their skills and experience are a formidable asset in any medical malpractice, personal injury or product liability case; because of them, we can quickly and accurately evaluate a case and effectively determine the best course of action.

Unlike other firms, our nurses are a full-time part of our team. Our lawyers and nurses work together to ensure that no stone goes unturned and make sure that you have the information you need to successfully pursue a case. Like our attorneys, our medical team has spent time working for and defending healthcare and insurance providers. The combined knowledge and experience on the other side of the courtroom is invaluable.

Any time healthcare results in an injury or illness, establishing the chain events and proving cause involves mountains of paperwork and miles of red tape. Our team has the experience to turn mountains into molehills and cut through that tape; we get answers, and we fight to get the best possible results for each and every one of our clients.

If you believe that your loved one is a victim of medical malpractice or negligence, the experienced Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve. <a href="/Contact.shtml">Call us </a>in Kentucky at 877.651.7764, in Ohio at 877.686.8879, or contact us today for a free consultation.

Well what you should know about Erb&#x2019;s palsy is that it is an injury that occurs, oftentimes in newborns, at the time of delivery. What happens is that when a newborn is coming through the birth canal, at the last moment when the head peaks, unfortunately some children their shoulder will get stuck under the pubis symphysis, which is part of the pelvis, the woman&#x2019;s pelvis. When that shoulder gets stuck the obstetrician will, or is faced with, essentially, an obstetrical emergency; they have to get that baby out of the birth canal within a relatively short period of time because the time that shoulder is stuck the umbilical chord is also compressed so the baby is not getting oxygen and blood.

What happens then is the doctor has to get this baby out, so they will put the woman, the mother, through a series of maneuvers to try to release that shoulder, it&#x2019;s the anterior shoulder, and get that baby delivered. In doing so, if the doctor isn&#x2019;t careful, they can put excessive traction on the baby&#x2019;s head trying to get the baby out from under the pubis. And when they do that they can cause this angle between your head and your shoulder to be extended and when that happens you can stretch what&#x2019;s called the brachial plexus, which is a series of nerves, c1 through c6, that innervate your arm and hands and provide the necessary nerves for function and feeling in that part of the body. If you stretch it too far you can tear or completely avulse the nerve from the spinal column, and when we say avulse we mean literally pull that nerve root completely out of the spinal cord. When that happens the child is ultimately delivered, when the child is ultimately delivered, the pediatrician will note that the child&#x2019;s arm is oftentimes limp or it will turn in shortly after birth and that will tell the pediatrician, uh-oh we have an Erb&#x2019;s Palsy.

Then they will evaluate the child and will make a decision whether or not that Erb&#x2019;s palsy is something will resolve, most of them will resolve, it&#x2019;s just a stretching, but the severe ones, oftentimes where the doctors have put excessive traction on that head trying to get that child out, won&#x2019;t resolve and that baby will be left with permanent disability, will ultimately require multiple surgeries to try to return the function to the best of whatever they can, but they will never have a normal, completely normal functioning arm.

There&#x2019;s a whole realm of-- there&#x2019;s a whole spectrum of injury from mild to very severe and people can ultimately be very deformed as a result of a severe Erb&#x2019;s palsy. Inevitably, Erb&#x2019;s palsy is almost always due to a widening of that angle between the head and the shoulder during the birthing process. Almost always, that widening is due to traction by the delivering physician in trying to get the child out. It could also happen, I guess if you used forceps, these big clamps that go around a child&#x2019;s head, and if a physician pulls too hard on the head, that could happen, or a vacuum, they put a vacuum suction cup on the end of a child&#x2019;s head and pull it out. But usually, it&#x2019;s an obstetrician&#x2019;s hands on a child&#x2019;s head and they&#x2019;re pushing down on that head trying to get that anterior shoulder, the upper shoulder, the shoulder that&#x2019;s pointing up towards the mothers belly button, trying to get that shoulder under the pubic bone. If a woman has a child with Erb&#x2019;s palsy, they should have somebody look into it. Often times, it&#x2019;s not due to negligence but if you have an Erb&#x2019;s palsy, your child has an Erb&#x2019;s palsy, odds are it was related to traction by a physician.

One final point is a temporary Erb&#x2019;s palsy, that&#x2019;s a whole different game, that can occur through mild traction and those almost always resolve on their own. When we&#x2019;re talking about excessive traction it is usually an avulsion of a nerve. So if a woman has a child and she&#x2019;s told, &#x201C;these nerve roots are avulsed in your child and we&#x2019;re going to have to perform surgery to try to restore the function to your child&#x2019;s arm the best that we can.&#x201D; That mother, I would suggest, needs to go talk to an attorney and have somebody look at the care and treatment of that delivery.

Erb&#x2019;s palsy is just one of several possible results from birth complications referred to as brachial plexus injuries. These injuries, in turn, stem from problems during birth. The proximate cause of Erb&#x2019;s palsy can range from breech presentation to delayed delivery to shoulder dystocia; in short, the more difficult the birth, the more likely there are to be complications.

Your healthcare providers are responsible for evaluating the position of your baby and the overall chances that a complication will arise well before you go into labor. There are early intervention options to help delivery go as smoothly as possible; doctors can help an infant into a more favorable position for natural birth, or determine well in advance that a Cesarean section is safest for both mom and baby.

Minor brachial plexus injuries involving stretching the nerves, a condition that can heal spontaneously or with minor therapy. Major brachial plexus injuries involve tearing the nerve bundle out of the spinal column; outside of science fiction, there is no way to reconnect severed nerves. A severe brachial plexus injury can cause permanent and irreversible Erb&#x2019;s palsy.

The accident happened when the bus driver fell asleep and rear-ended a tractor-trailer; Soberay sustained multiple injuries in the wreck, including a severed urethra, injuries requiring an amputation of his right leg, and various soft tissue injuries and shattered bones that required more than thirty surgeries to repair.
<h2>Fatigued drivers are dangerous drivers</h2>
<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/02/greyhound_bus_driver_fell_asle.html">Cleveland.com</a> reported, &#x201C;The case hinged on a&#xA0;rule in Greyhound&apos;s handbook that says drivers &#x2018;are to stop every approximately 150 miles or three hours&#x2019; to inspect the tires. The rulebook also says driver&apos;s should take the stops as an opportunity to get some &#x2018;fresh air&#x2019; to ward off driver fatigue... Greyhound officials testified that they consider the 150-mile rule a &#x2018;guideline&#x2019; and do not punish drivers for not following it.&#x201D;
<h2>The real issue</h2>
Fatigued driving is a serious problem; it&#x2019;s just one of the contributing factors that reversed a 50 year decline in highway fatalities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports more than 100,000 fatigue-related crashes every year, and a recent study found that even one hour of lost sleep doubles the risk of a crash. Opting to take the bus or the train has long been seen as a safer option, but when accidents do happen, the risk of catastrophic injury or death is much higher.

When negligent drivers are coupled with negligent companies, it&#x2019;s only a matter of time before someone gets hurt. Transportation companies and their employees are responsible for the safety of their passengers; when that safety is compromised, the company is liable for any and all damages and injuries. If you or your loved one has been injured in a commercial carrier accident, you may be entitled to compensation for medical bills and lost wages. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky bus accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

The largest accident has been called the worst in Baltimore&#x2019;s recent history; more than sixty vehicles piled up on the highway after a fuel tanker slid off a bridge and exploded when it struck the roadway below. The massive accident killed two and injured dozens; traffic was snarled for hours as first responders worked amidst freezing conditions to get victims to safety.

Just one mile ahead of the conflagration and resulting pileup, the victims of another smaller pileup were forced to wait hours for emergency services to respond. An eastern Kentucky tour bus en route to New York City slid on ice and crashed into a box truck that had struck other vehicles. Passenger Katrina Conley told <a href="http://www.wymt.com/content/news/eky-tour-bus-involved-in-weather-related-crashes.html">WYMT</a>, &#x201C;We had to sit on the bus for like three hours because the fire department got to us but they couldn&#x2019;t get any ambulances to us. They said they had like 60 ambulances out, and I guess at the time the other wreck... had more serious injuries... so most of the ambulances went there.&#x201D;
<h2>An accident that shouldn&#x2019;t have happened</h2>
According to the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/title49/section/392.14">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration&#x2019;s</a> regulation &#xA7;392.14, &#x201C;Extreme caution in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle shall be exercised when hazardous conditions... adversely affect visibility or traction. Speed shall be reduced when such conditions exist. If conditions become sufficiently dangerous, the operation of the commercial motor vehicle shall be discontinued and shall not be resumed until the commercial motor vehicle can be safely operated. Whenever compliance with the foregoing provisions of this rule increases hazard to passengers, the commercial motor vehicle may be operated to the nearest point at which the safety of passengers is assured.&#x201D;

Essentially, the decision as to whether conditions are too hazardous to continue is up to the driver. As with any provision that relies on individual decision, the basis for evaluation becomes a standard of care; in other words, actions are judged on the basis of whether the majority of people with similar qualifications would make the same decision in similar circumstances. Determining a breach of standard of care is often complicated, but in this case, it&#x2019;s fairly straightforward. The sheer number of accidents that occurred that day offers overwhelming evidence that travel conditions were hazardous at best.
<h2>Passengers have rights</h2>
Common carriers like this tour bus are not exempt from the threats of the road; when bad judgment and poor conditions coincide, people get hurt. A driver is responsible for the health and safety of all passengers. If a commercial driver&#x2019;s risky behavior caused you harm, you may be entitled to compensation for injuries and lost wages. The experienced Kentucky common carrier attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

What&#x2019;s worse than suffering catastrophic injuries in an auto accident? Finding out that the person who hit you is uninsured. Despite steep penalties designed to keep uninsured drivers off the roads, more than 1 in 10 drivers in Ohio are uninsured. According to the most recent data available from the <a href="http://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/uninsured-motorists">Insurance Information Institute</a>, Ohio has the 17<sup>th</sup> highest rate of uninsured drivers in the nation. Recovering from catastrophic injuries after an auto accident is hard enough; finding out that the driver who caused them is uninsured can be devastating.

Ohio is an at-fault state; whoever causes an accident is on the hook to pay for any damages. Unfortunately, the state does not require drivers to carry uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance, and many people opt out of the extra coverage in an effort to save money. While reducing your monthly premium can save you in the short run, insufficient insurance coverage can be ruinous in the long run.
<h2>How to get compensation</h2>
If you suffer injuries in an accident caused by an uninsured driver, there are two options to recover damages; you can file a claim for uninsured motorist benefits with your own insurance company, or you can sue the uninsured driver. Navigating even these basic steps can be complicated and time-consuming, especially when recovering from serious injuries. Experienced legal counsel can help you determine which path offers the best chance of recovering damages and help you plan for the future.

Even if the person who caused your accident is in poor financial health, a current judgment in your favor can be collected in the future. You don&#x2019;t have to suffer financial hardship for injuries and damages that weren&#x2019;t your fault. If you have been injured by an uninsured driver or in any other accident, the experienced Kentucky and Ohio auto accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

The research, recently published in the journal <em>Neurology, </em>examined the sleep habits of 30 patients who had been hospitalized for moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) following an accident. The results from the University of Montreal are the latest findings that are helping to establish a firm link between good sleep and brain health.
<h2>An important discovery</h2>
From <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/uninterrupted-sleep-may-advance-healing-patients-tbi">The National Law Review</a>, &#x201C;The findings in this study showed that as the brain heals, sleep patterns also improve. Gosselin&#x2019;s theory is that it could work just as well in reverse order, i.e., if sleep patterns are normalized on a 24 hour cycle, neuron repair would be accelerated.&#xA0;Supporting this theory is an earlier study showing a link between cognitive rest and TBI symptoms.&#x201D;

This link doesn&#x2019;t just provide hope for TBI victims; it may be an important tool in the fight against neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer&#x2019;s and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Jeffrey Iliff, a brain scientist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, told <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/01/04/460620606/lack-of-deep-sleep-may-set-the-stage-for-alzheimers">NPR</a>, &#x201C;&#x2019;Changes in sleep habits may actually be setting the stage&#x2019; for dementia. The brain appears to clear out toxins linked to Alzheimer&apos;s during sleep.... And, at least among research animals that don&apos;t get enough solid shut-eye, those toxins can build up and damage the brain.&#x201D;

Today&#x2019;s problems, tomorrow&#x2019;s solutions

While further research is needed, the findings at the very least indicate that regulating sleep can&#x2019;t make a brain injury worse. If further studies confirm that the link between brain health and sleep works both ways, these results could become a powerful tool in the treatment of brain injuries and disorders. While research like this may ultimately find a cure for a damaged brain, the world we live in today offers only limited options for recovery.

For now, victims of TBI require extensive therapy, rehabilitation and other continuing care, all of which contribute to mountains of medical bills. Recovery and treatment options may not be immediately clear, and the future can be very uncertain. Experienced legal counsel isn&#x2019;t an extreme option; sometimes, it&#x2019;s the only way to protect your family.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5561" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tractor-Trailer-Driver&#x2019;s-Methamphetamine-Use-Caused-This-2015-Fatal-Pileup-300x200.jpg" alt="tractor-trailer-drivers-methamphetamine-use-caused-this-2015-fatal-pileup" width="300" height="200">Last June in Tennessee, a seven-car pileup in a construction zone killed six people and injured eighteen more. An investigation into the crash found that the tractor-trailer responsible for the initial collision was traveling at better than 80mph into a zone of heavy traffic; no attempt was made to slow down or evade the snarled traffic. After months of investigation, federal officials with the National Transportation Safety Board reported that the truck&#x2019;s driver, Benjamin Brewer, was probably fatigued and had tested positive for the drug methamphetamine.
<h2>How it happened</h2>
Investigators found that Brewer had not slept for at least 40 hours leading up to the crash; initial reports cited a 50-hour long-haul run from Kentucky to Florida and back. Allegedly, Brewer checked in regularly with his employer during that time, indicating that both the driver and the trucking company knowingly violated federal duty regulations. Worse, Brewer shouldn&#x2019;t have been on the road at all, a fact that a simple commercial driver&#x2019;s license database like the one proposed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration would have disclosed, but his employer should have discovered nonetheless.

From the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/tired-truck-driver-high-meth-caused-car-crash-killed-article-1.2817742">New York Daily News</a>:

&#x201C;In its release of the probable cause findings for the June 2015 crash, the National Transportation Safety Board also cited a failure in the employee screening process to determine that driver Benjamin Brewer of London, Kentucky, had been fired from a previous trucking job two years earlier because of illegal drug use. A hair test administered under an unrelated court order less than three months before the crash had also turned out positive for meth... &#x2018;The driver in this crash should not have been behind the wheel of a large truck,&#x2019; said NTSB Chairman Christopher A. Hart. &#x2018;As long as human beings drive trucks, they must be rested and unimpaired.&#x2019;&#x201D;
<h2>Drugs and driving don&#x2019;t mix</h2>
The loss of life and the injuries sustained by victims of Brewer&#x2019;s (and his employer&#x2019;s) negligence is unforgivable, but the circumstances are hardly unusual in the commercial trucking industry. Big companies focus on the bottom line, leaving truck drivers with the option of driving fatigued or turning to illegal stimulants when coffee just won&#x2019;t cut it anymore. According to data from the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/data-and-statistics/large-truck-and-bus-crash-facts-2014">FMCSA</a>, around 40% of the drivers who test positive for drugs after a fatal accident were using some form of stimulant.

Benjamin Brewer shouldn&#x2019;t have been allowed behind the wheel of a commercial truck; his proven history of drug use and abuse directly caused the deaths of six people and the emotional pain and suffering of dozens more. When companies ignore the law and drivers ignore common sense, people suffer. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight for victims and their families when they need us most.

But it&#x2019;s also an important story &#x2013; one that should be given a little more status, perhaps, than it has &#x2013; for a few reasons.

To recap: Christ Hospital Health Network bought some land that sits on I-71 and I-75 in Northern Kentucky. They want to build a new outpatient surgical center there (a $24 million project), and according to <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/02/02/st-e-christ-duking-out-over-nky-surgery-center/97052036/">Cincinnati.com</a>, would be the anchor building for new housing and retail buildings. In order for Christ Hospital to build there, they need a certificate of need: a document from Kentucky&#x2019;s Cabinet for Health and Family Services that will &#x201C;control costs by preventing unnecessary construction or duplication of services.&#x201D;

But St. Elizabeth Healthcare says the new center would be &#x201C;an unfair effort to cherry-pick wealthier patients in a market where nine outpatient surgical centers already operate at less than full capacity&#x201D; by Christ Hospital, because there are already nine &#x201C;ambulatory surgical centers&#x201D; in the northern Kentucky region. St Elizabeth, which merged with St. Luke&#x2019;s system back in 2008, owns six of them.
<h2>A corporate giant, an overly selective hospital &#x2013; or something else altogether?</h2>
The problem can be viewed in two ways: St. Elizabeth&#x2019;s system is essentially a monopoly, which means that Christ Hospital is offering some much-needed competition. However, St. Elizabeth also bears the weight of caring for patients on Medicaid &#x2013; a weight that Christ Hospital would avoid by serving an area that is much more likely to be well-insured. (The Cincinnati.com article offers a more extensive explanation of the problems, which we would encourage you to read.)

From our perspective, there&#x2019;s a different problem altogether: namely, that patients often forget that hospitals are businesses first, and providers second. We&#x2019;re watching two of the best hospitals systems in the region (Christ Hospital is #1 in Cincinnati and #5 in Ohio, and St. Elizabeth is #5 in the Cincinnati metro area, though they earned the #3 spot in Kentucky) fight for more patients, and for specific &#x201C;kinds&#x201D; of patients, in order to make money. There has been no discussion of what kinds of new technologies or services either system will offer &#x2013; only discussions about how much more money they can make. And while both promise to be cost-effective for patients, there is no indication that people will save any more money.

There are some extraordinary doctors in each of these systems, and some not-so-extraordinary ones, too. But at the end of the day, these medical &#x201C;titans&#x201D; aren&#x2019;t battling it out for your health: they&#x2019;re doing it for your money. It&#x2019;s why civil lawsuits against hospitals on behalf of injured patients are often the only truly effective tool for stopping dangerous practices. You have to hit them where it hurts: their wallets.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5664" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/https-www.cpw-law.comcontact-us-300x200.jpg" alt="The Future Is Now: There Are Disease Destroying Robots at Christ Hospital" width="300" height="200">Let&#x2019;s start with the premise that robots are cool. Autonomous cars, drones, BB-8, that machine that mixes drinks on cruises &#x2013; there seems to be no limit to what technology can do to benefit the world. And while there are considerable (and justifiable) concerns over issues like liability and artificial intelligence, new tech has done much to help the medical field, and to improve patient safety.

Perhaps nowhere is this more obvious than at Christ Hospital in the greater Cincinnati area, where there are five Xenex LightStrike Germ-Zapping Robots being used to &#x201C;zap&#x201D; dangerous, infectious pathogens that can lead to hospital-acquired infections, or HAIs.

Christ Hospital is not the only one using this type of technology; UC Health has also used robots to clean and sanitize rooms. However, as <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/01/23/new-fangled-robots-zap-infectious-bugs-christ-hospital/96783296/">Cincinnati.com</a> explains:

&#x201C;UC Health has been using UV blasters as a tool against infections; yet the UC Medical Center was among the four area hospitals <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/01/09/us-punishes-4-cincinnati-area-hospitals/96211876/">penalized for their infection rates</a>. Christ Hospital says the older technology uses mercury bulbs to create the light, while the Xenex LightStrike Germ-Zapping Robot uses pulsed xenon, which emits a light intense enough to penetrate cell walls and fuse the DNA of microorganisms. The fusing renders the microorganisms unable to reproduce or mutate, killing them on surfaces without contact or chemicals.&#x201D;
<h2>Putting an end to HAIs at Ohio hospitals</h2>
Hospital-acquired infections are a serious problem in Ohio hospitals &#x2013; indeed, in hospitals throughout the country. To combat the problem, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services rolled out the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/HAC-reduction-program.html">Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program</a> in October of 2014. In short, CMS started reducing payments to worst-ranking hospitals in terms of preventing and/or reducing the number of HAIs they have. Scores are based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) measure (90 composite required), as well as measures taken to prevent and reduce the number of the following infections:
<ul>
    <li>Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI)</li>
    <li>Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI)</li>
    <li>Surgical Site Infection (SSI) &#x2013; colon and hysterectomy</li>
    <li>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia</li>
    <li>Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI)</li>
</ul>
If you&#x2019;re interested in how these scores are assigned, this easy-to-read <a href="https://www.stratishealth.org/documents/HAC_fact_sheet.pdf">fact sheet</a> may help.

Hospital-acquired infections can be life-threatening, so Christ Hospital&#x2019;s new xenon-based robots are a definite step in the right direction to reduce, and hopefully one day eliminate, the pathogens which harm so many. We must be careful, though, to remember that even high tech gadgets can fail or falter, and that hospitals should be held accountable when good tech goes bad, and people suffer as a result.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we help victims of medical malpractice in Ohio and Kentucky secure a better future.

Later that night, she, some of her friends and three of her children piled into a car to head to New Orleans where Mansfield had another engagement the next day. The 34-year-old actress never made it; she and the other adults in the front of the car were killed instantly when the driver rear-ended a tractor-trailer. The high profile death made headlines and prompted the first calls for underride guards on the back and sides of big trucks almost exactly half a century ago.

Thirty years later, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made rear underride guards mandatory and gave the safety mechanism a name: Mansfield bars. However, proponents of underride guards then and now claim that Mansfield bars aren&#x2019;t enough; trucks need side guards as well to protect against grisly accidents with gruesome results. Most passenger cars strike trailers at almost exactly head height, and underride incursions often shear off the top of these smaller vehicles with devastating consequences.
<h2>Why we still don&#x2019;t have side guards</h2>
From <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/side-underride-crashes-kill-200-people-year-will-congress-act-n711721">NBC News</a>, &#x201C;Side guards are still not required, even though the NTSB, which investigates accidents, concluded that they would reduce injuries and deaths on America&apos;s roads. It issued a non-binding recommendation to the NHTSA in April 2014 that all new trailers have side protection systems. The Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, the industry&apos;s lobbying arm, has opposed a side guard requirement for years. It referred NBC News to a 2014 letter to the NHTSA that cited the added cost, technical challenges and concern that the guards could weaken parts of a trailer or dangerously increase their weight.&#x201D;

As usual, a lobbyist group is arguing points that simply don&#x2019;t hold water. There is no technological or materials barrier to side underride guards; there is simply a price of implementation. Just like product formulations and drug costs, Europe is ahead of the game. Commercial trucks across the pond have rear and side underride guards; bridges aren&#x2019;t collapsing under the increased weight, nor has there been a rash of trailer collapses from weakened frames. Instead, a valuable safety feature is preventing deaths from underride incursions.

More than 200 people die and many more are seriously injured each year in the US from underride truck accidents. These deaths and injuries are not pretty, and they are largely preventable. Unfortunately, until bureaucracy catches up with common sense, families will continue to suffer the consequences of commercial truck accidents that leave victims maimed or dead. If your loved one was injured or killed in a commercial truck accident, you may be entitled to compensation for medical bills, lost wages and other damages. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky commercial truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

The couple gave birth to a son in 2012, but complications during the labor left baby Justinian with &#x201C;cerebral palsy and catastrophic disabilities&#x201D; according to the lawsuit. After spending two years contending with the realities of Justinian&#x2019;s care, the couple filed a lawsuit. It was another two years before the case was heard, but after four years of trials and travails, the young family will finally get the help they deserve; a civil court jury awarded the plaintiffs a record $14.5 million in damages.

The facts The lawsuit centered on Dr. Thomas Carnevale&#x2019;s use of Pitocin to induce labor; according to pretrial memos, Welker received an inappropriately high dose of the drug despite the fact that her labor was progressing normally. In addition to the inappropriate administration, Dr. Carnevale failed to stop the administering the drug when the fetal heart rate dropped.

From The Legal Intelligencer, &#x201C;The memo said the fetal heart rate progressively slowed for the next hour, dropping to 60 beats per minute by 8:10 p.m., and Carnevale took some steps to expedite the delivery. By that point Carnevale should have taken Welker off Pitocin, the memo said, but Welker remained on the drug for the rest of the delivery. By 8:20 p.m., the memo said, the baby&apos;s head was crowning so it could have been delivered by vacuum or forceps, but the delivery continued for about another 10 minutes before Carnevale cut an episiotomy and the baby was born.&#x201D;
<h2>Why the award was necessary</h2>
Justinian suffers from spastic tetraparesis cerebral palsy (meaning all four limbs are affected) with impaired cognition. He experiences seizures and a condition called global aphasia, meaning that his ability to understand or express language has been severely compromised. He will never be able to socialize normally, never go on a first date, never drive a car; in short, he will never be able to lead a normal life. Justinian will likely require around the clock medical care for the rest of his natural life, and his parents have had to cover costs from specialized equipment to retrofitting their house with ramps, mechanical lifts and other devices.

Large verdicts make headlines and are a bone of contention. Some claim that large malpractice verdicts result in higher insurance costs, and therefore higher healthcare costs. Others point to a broken legal system &#x2013; but not one of those arguments considers the value of a life. In this case, the jury was asked to assign an annual cost of healthcare through the year 2063. Remember, that&#x2019;s twenty-four hour

care for the next forty-six years; suddenly, $14 million doesn&#x2019;t sound like so much money anymore.

Birth injuries of any kind are devastating. Parents hope for a better life for their children, but they&#x2019;ll settle for a normal life; when birth injuries happen, a normal life is a blessing. If your child suffered a birth injury, you may be entitled to compensation for medical bills, therapy and other care.

You&#x2019;re going to work with people whose lives have been turned upside down, who have lost loved ones, and who have been permanently injured in some way. When you work with nursing home residents, like our team in Kentucky does, you&#x2019;re going to see a lot of really heart-breaking cases of neglect and physical abuse involving a vulnerable part of society: the elderly. It&#x2019;s never easy, but you work hard and you fight even harder on behalf of the people who need you.

But some stories are even more horrific than you can imagine. A recent CNN investigatory piece, titled &#x201C;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/02/health/nursing-home-sex-abuse-investigation/">Sick, Dying and Raped in America&#x2019;s Nursing Homes</a>,&#x201D; is one of those stories. Actually, it&#x2019;s a collection of stories about the atrocities committed against an aging population throughout the country &#x2013; not just in Kentucky, but in every state. According to their research:

&#x201C;More than 16,000 complaints of sexual abuse have been reported since 2000 in long-term care facilities (which include both nursing homes and assisted living facilities), according to federal data housed by the <a href="https://acl.gov/">Administration for Community Living</a>. <strong>But agency officials warned that this figure doesn&apos;t capture everything</strong> -- only those cases in which state long-term care ombudsmen (who act as advocates for facility residents) were somehow involved in resolving the complaints&#x201D; (emphasis ours).

CNN&#x2019;s own research showed that between 2013 and 2016, more than 1,000 nursing homes were cited by the federal government &#x201C;for mishandling or failing to prevent alleged cases of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse at their facilities.&#x201D; Almost 10% of them had more than one citation. Close to 500 facilities didn&#x2019;t contact the police, didn&#x2019;t do thorough background checks on employees, and didn&#x2019;t investigate accusations.
<h2>Why are so many nursing home residents sexually abused?</h2>
Rape and sexual abuse are rarely about sex: they about power. And few people are more powerless than elderly patients suffering from degenerative diseases, or from conditions like Alzheimer&#x2019;s or dementia. Patients in nursing homes need help taking care of themselves for a variety of reasons, which can make them easy targets for abuse or neglect. They simply cannot fend off an abuser.

Furthermore, many nursing home abuse victims are unable to point out their attackers. They may suffer from visual impairment or cognitive disabilities, or may be unable to communicate verbally in any way. CNN points out that &#x201C;victims with dementia and other diseases are often considered such unreliable witnesses that even cases in which an assailant confesses to the crime can end up being thrown out or result in little punishment for the defendant.&#x201D;
<h2>Protecting nursing home residents from abuse</h2>
First and foremost, facilities need to be held accountable for crimes committed against their residents, no matter what kind of crimes they are. In order to do that, though, we must implement some kind of reporting system to keep track of these abuses, and to ensure that that these reports get to the proper authorities.

We must also demand that any incident of abuse, sexual or otherwise, is thoroughly investigated by the facility, and by the police. This means treating these cases like the crimes they are: witness interviews, preservation of evidence, and justice for the victims.

Prevention of these crimes is critical. To that end, a handful of states have passed laws allowing cameras to be placed in residents&#x2019; rooms (Kentucky isn&#x2019;t one of them), but there are other issues regarding privacy that can complicate the matter, especially if the resident shares a room. Until the law is clear, nursing homes need to properly train and supervise their employees.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5742" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Pill-Mill-Doc-Charged-with-74-Counts-of-Malpractice-Over-Opioid-Prescriptions-300x200.jpg" alt="pill-mill-doc-charged-with-74-counts-of-malpractice-over-opioid-prescriptions" width="300" height="200">The opioid epidemic in America is becoming more serious with each passing year. Opioid-related overdose deaths have been rising at a staggering rate; 2014 saw more than 28,000 deaths, though that number was quickly outpaced by the 33,000 overdose deaths in 2015. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, more than half a million people died from drug overdoses between 2000 and 2015, a rate of 91 deaths each and every day.

There is some debate over how much blame to assign to prescribing practices in the past. In some cases, the <a href="https://www.patientsrightsblog.com/middle-public-health-crisis-doctors-caused/">opioid prescriptions</a> are undoubtedly appropriate; in others, their use is determined on a case-by-case basis. As in all things, however, there are outliers; some physicians are worse offenders than others. A recent bust in Nevada saw 74 counts of malpractice filed against a Dr. Robert Rand for allegedly running a &#x201C;pill-mill.&#x201D;
<h2>The story</h2>
From the <a href="http://www.rgj.com/story/news/2017/02/02/pill-mill-doctor-faces-74-counts-malpractice-opioid-prescriptions/97429086/">Reno Gazette-Journal</a>:

&#x201C;The malpractice complaint alleges&#xA0;Rand &#x2018;violated the standards of practice in regard to opioid prescribing, practiced medicine beyond the scope of training and competence, engaged in unsafe and unprofessional conduct and maintained substandard medical records.&#x2019; The patients involved in&#xA0;the complaint were prescribed &#x2018;massive amounts&#x2019; of highly addictive opioid narcotics, including doses at several times the &#x2018;high dose threshold,&#x2019; the complaint said. Only one of the 18 patients in the complaint is described as deceased. Rand is charged in connection with the death of 33-year-old Michael Yenick, a former Manogue High School football player who died of alcohol and oxycodone intoxication.&#x201D;

While Dr. Rand cools his heels in the Washoe County Jail, the Nevada Board of Medical Examiners is considering the evidence. That agency can strip Rand of his medical license, but they have no further powers. Instead, Rand will face criminal drug distribution charges down the road. At the moment, there&#x2019;s a chance that Rand will be released from jail before the medical board has a chance to consider his case, leaving a potential criminal free to continue writing prescriptions indefinitely.
<h2>With great power comes great responsibility</h2>
Healthcare providers are held to higher standard of care for a reason; they are entrusted with the health (and by extension, the lives) of the people they treat. This trust, and the powers that go with it (the ability to prescribe otherwise dangerous substances to treat legitimate illnesses), come at a high cost- obtaining a doctorate takes money, time, and a great deal of discipline. Sometimes, medical professionals forget that with great power comes great responsibility; when they do, real people suffer serious consequences.

If your loved one has been the victim of medical negligence or misdiagnosis, you may be entitled to compensation for medical bills, lost wages and other damages. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio medical malpractice lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you need.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5767" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Infant-Hypoxic-Ischemic-Encephalopathy-and-Birth-Injuries-300x200.jpg" alt="infant-hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy-and-birth-injuries" width="300" height="200">Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is a catastrophic medical condition that occurs during childbirth. It happens when the brain and other organs suffer damage due to a lack of blood or oxygen. It is a common enough condition that birth doctors should anticipate it and take the necessary steps to prevent it.
<ul>
    <li>Hypoxia refers to the brain and different organs</li>
    <li>Ischemia refers to low blood flow</li>
    <li>Encephalopathy is the damage that occurs to the brain because of the improper amount of blood or oxygen</li>
</ul>
If the lack of blood or oxygen flow is too prolonged or severe, serious birth injuries or death can result.
<h2>HIE symptoms</h2>
Common symptoms of Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy include:
<ul>
    <li>Amniotic fluid that is meconium-stained</li>
    <li>A low heart rate</li>
    <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
    <li>Improper or pale skin color</li>
    <li>Excess blood acid</li>
</ul>
Diagnostic tests are used to determine if the newborn has HIE. Common tests include a CT or MRI scan, an echocardiography test, and an ultrasound. An EKG or EEG test may also be used. HIE can range from moderate to severe.

Newborns with mild symptoms may live a relatively normal life. Children with severe symptoms often live with pain and some tragically have a shortened life expectancy. Common medical problems can include:
<ul>
    <li>Cognitive difficulties</li>
    <li>Delays in the development of motor skills</li>
    <li>Neurodevelopmental delays</li>
    <li>Epilepsy</li>
</ul>
The true depth of HIE may not be known until the child is three or four years old.
<h2>HIE causes</h2>
HIE should be anticipated during pregnancy, delivery, and after birth. Doctors and hospitals should anticipate and monitor the known causes during the pregnancy, including checking for:
<ul>
    <li>Maternal diabetes</li>
    <li>Preeclampsia &#x2013; a well-known pregnancy complication involving high blood pressure</li>
    <li>Heart disease</li>
    <li>Placenta-related circulation problems</li>
    <li>Abuse of alcohol and drugs</li>
    <li>Fetal anemia</li>
</ul>
Infections and malformation of the lungs can also contribute to HIE prior to the delivery process.

Birth delivery complications can include an abnormal position of the fetus, a ruptured placenta or uterus, a lengthy delivery, problems with the umbilical cord, and excessive bleeding.

HIE can also be due to a lack of proper care after the delivery. Some well-known postpartum HIE problems include:
<ul>
    <li>Heart or lung disease</li>
    <li>Sepsis, meningitis, and other infections</li>
    <li>Low blood pressure</li>
    <li>Trauma to the brain or skull</li>
    <li>A congenital malformation of the brain</li>
</ul>
There are some treatment options, if done timely, that may help reduce the immediate complications from HIE. Mechanical ventilators can help a baby breathe. Medications can help with seizures. In the long-term, many children with HIE need extensive rehabilitative care.

The Kentucky birth injury malpractice lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law know how crushing an HIE diagnosis of your child can be. We understand the distress and anxiety about the child&#x2019;s ability to function normally and lead a healthy life.

The whole reason for doing this was to reduce the risk to the mother of hemorrhaging. As it turns out, that associated risk wasn&#x2019;t really a risk at all, and recent studies show that the benefits to delaying the cut are too good to ignore.

This January, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, &#x201C;became the latest major medical organization to formally recommend that doctors routinely wait before clamping and cutting the cord,&#x201D; as per the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/well/family/doctors-no-longer-rush-to-cut-the-umbilical-cord.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;_r=0"><em>New York Times</em></a>. They join with the American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization and the American College of Nurse-Midwives in advising that doctors hold off on severing the umbilical cord. In their announcement, ACOG states:
<ul>
    <li>&#x201C;In term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, which may have a favorable effect on developmental outcomes.</li>
    <li>Delayed umbilical cord clamping is associated with significant neonatal benefits in preterm infants, including improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, decreased need for blood transfusion, and lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage.</li>
    <li>Given the benefits to most newborns and concordant with other professional organizations, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends a delay in umbilical cord clamping in vigorous term and preterm infants for at least 30&#x2013;60 seconds after birth.&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
The extra blood and iron contributes to the newborn&#x2019;s brain development; the <em>Times</em> cites a <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7157">2011 trial in Sweden</a> where children who had delayed cord cutting &#x201C;had modestly higher scores in fine motor and social skills&#x201D; and were less likely to be iron-deficient in their early months of life. Because iron deficiency and poor oxygenation can lead to difficulties later, cutting the cord too soon may even be detrimental in some ways. There is also the chance that, given &#x201C;umbilical cord blood contains immunoglobins and stem cells... researchers speculate that delayed cord clamping might aid immune function and tissue healing,&#x201D; but this has not yet been studied.

The benefits of delayed clamping to pre-term child have long been espoused by most medical organizations, but now more and more groups are coming forward about the benefits for term babies as well. The <em>Times</em> claims there are currently 16 studies regarding cord clamping protocols, all of which may yield useful information for helping to protect both mothers and their children &#x2013; and that&#x2019;s something we can stand behind.

We&#x2019;ve spoken quite a bit about tort reform in the past, and the dangers it poses to victims of serious personal injuries and medical malpractice. We&#x2019;ve fought it in the state legislatures in Ohio and Kentucky, when such bills came up, and we&#x2019;ve fought it in the court of public opinion, too. Limiting a victim&#x2019;s ability to collect fair and just compensation not only makes it more difficult for that person to survive, but it undermines any real accountability that the negligent party has.

It should come as no surprise, then, that we will proudly fight against federal attempts to cave into the corporations at the expense of their victims. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_38">Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution</a> guarantees your right to a civil trial by jury. For all the masquerading that H.R. 1215 does, at its core, it is in violation of your Constitutional rights.
<h2>What is the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017?</h2>
You can <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1215/text/ih">read the full text</a> here, but let&#x2019;s start with the summary of the bill, H.R. 1215, itself: &#x201C;To improve patient access to health care services and provide improved medical care by reducing the excessive burden the liability system places on the health care delivery system.&#x201D; In short, it&#x2019;s a bill designed to take away your rights to a jury trial, and to limit how much compensation an injury victim can collect.

Remember: medical errors are the third leading cause of death in this country. This new bill will destroy any incentive that the medical industry has to actually fixing that problem.
<h2>What damage caps will H.R. 1215 put into place?</h2>
The new bill places no caps on economic damages, a small silver lining on a thunderstorm cloud. It will, however, drastically limit the amount of non-economic damages you may be able to collect &#x2013; and in a sneaky way, too. From the bill (excerpts in bold were emphasized by us):
<ul>
    <li>&#x201C;In any health care lawsuit, <strong>the amount of noneconomic damages, if available, shall not exceed $250,000, </strong>regardless of the number of parties against whom the action is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with respect to the same injury.&#x201D;</li>
    <li>&#x201C;<strong>The jury shall not be informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages</strong>. An award for noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall be reduced either before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the judgment after entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be made before accounting for any other reduction in damages required by law.&#x201D;</li>
    <li>&#x201C;In any health care lawsuit, each party shall be liable for that party&#x2019;s several share of any damages only and not for the share of any other person. <strong>Each party shall be liable only for the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party&#x2019;s percentage of responsibility</strong>.&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional concerns about the bill</h2>
Damage caps have always been a problem, but we have deeply-rooted concerns about the rest of the bill, as well.&#xA0;H.R. 1215 also stands to:
<ul>
    <li>Eliminate the class-action lawsuit</li>
    <li>Make all healthcare claims federal claims, thus eliminating any states&#x2019; individual laws</li>
    <li>Allow insurance companies to pay out claims via payments, as opposed to all at once</li>
</ul>
It is worth noting, perhaps, that plaintiff attorneys &#x2013; those of us who fight for victims &#x2013; will have their fees limited, but defense attorneys &#x2013; those who represent the negligent parties who caused you harm &#x2013; have no such limitations placed on their salaries. In other words, the doctor who missed your cancer diagnosis, or the nurse who mislabeled your chart and caused a drug overdose, or the surgeon who perforated your bowel but didn&#x2019;t fix it in time: their attorneys can charge whatever they want.
<h2>Why is H.R. 1215 bad for victims and their families?</h2>
This Congressional bill aims to fix a &#x201C;crisis&#x201D; that even medical malpractice insurers say does not exist, and has not existed for more than a decade. According to <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/2017/01/11/gop-sees-malpractice-crisis-experts-do-not/96466290/">Cincinnati.com</a>, the Doctors Company, one of the country&#x2019;s largest medical malpractice insurance providers, says &#x201C;Doctors are paying less for malpractice insurance than they did in 2001 &#x2013; without any inflation adjustment.... And the rate of claims has dropped by half since 2003.&#x201D;

Despite a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-another-study-shows-why-tort-reform--20140919-column.html">WEALTH of evidence</a> to the contrary, including years&#x2019; worth of <a href="http://www.takejusticeback.com/who-we-are/fact_v_fiction">studies</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecohen/2015/03/02/on-tort-reform-its-time-to-declare-victory-and-withdraw/#33c1f27b63ea">research</a>, data collection, and so on, this Congress continues to perpetuate the lie that limiting the civil justice system, in terms of which kinds of lawsuits you can bring and in how much money a victim can collect, will do anything at all to save money when it comes to health care.

It won&#x2019;t. <a href="https://www.patientsrightsblog.com/tort-reform-damage-caps-protect-hospitals-not-patients/">It never has</a>. It never will. All tort reform has EVER done is hurt people more. The Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017 essentially says that it doesn&#x2019;t matter how severe, how catastrophic, your injuries are: they&#x2019;re worth $250,000 &#x2013; period. We understand that for a lot of people, that seems like a lot of money. So, we want to ask you this:

If a surgeon accidentally amputates your arm when he was supposed to be fixing a tendon in your leg, is that only worth $250,000?

If a doctor fails to recommend an emergency C-section because the umbilical cord is wrapped around your baby-to-be&#x2019;s neck, and now your child has permanent brain damage, is that only worth $250,000?

If a doctor prescribes the wrong dose of medication to your spouse and it kills him or her, is that only worth $250,000?

We urge everyone, whether you have had need of a medical malpractice or personal injury attorney or not, to <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">please contact your Representatives</a> and tell them to vote &#x201C;No&#x201D; on H.R. 1215. The only ones who will benefit from this bill are the ones who caused you harm.

In the meantime, Crandall &amp; Pera Law will continue to fight against this egregious bill. We will not back down and we will not give up. Our team has always fought to give a voice to the voiceless, and to protect the rights and futures of the injured. You can rely on us to do the same now.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5772" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/What-the-Sorin-3T-Contamination-Debacle-Means-for-Infected-Patients-300x226.jpg" alt="What the Sorin 3T Contamination Debacle Means for Infected Patients" width="300" height="226">We recently wrote about the Sorin 3T Heater-Cooler System, a medical device used in invasive open chest surgeries that was the subject of a recent investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency found that the device had been contaminated during the manufacturing process with a devastating type of bacteria know as <em>Mycobacterium chimaera</em>. Worse, a defect in the design of the device caused a related organism, <em>Mycobacterium abcessus</em>, to be aerosolized and sprayed out through the device&#x2019;s vent fan.
<h2>What makes mycobacteria so dangerous</h2>
First and foremost, the majority of surgeries that require the use of the Sorin 3T Heater-Cooler system are not minimally invasive procedures to repair minor damage. Any surgery that requires the chest cavity to be open and the cessation of heart activity requires serious recuperation time for individuals who were already health-compromised to begin with. For perspective, the most common open chest surgeries include coronary bypass, heart transplants and lung transplants.

When a chest surgery patient is infected with mycobacterium, there are no immediate symptoms. In fact, the very nature of this family of bacteria makes them difficult to detect and treat; through the ages, mankind has battled mycobacteria that cause leprosy and tuberculosis with very little success until the advent of modern medicine. Mycobacteria are extremely slow growing and very hardy; they have a triple-layered cell wall that makes them nearly impervious to antibiotics or any other treatment. In fact, any condition hazardous enough to kill a mycobacteria infection in a human would kill the human long before the infection was eliminated.
<h2>The cure is worse than the disease</h2>
Currently, mycobacteria infections are treated with long-term, high-dose antibiotics. This treatment can wreak all kinds of havoc on a healthy human being; in a patient living with an artificial valve or organ transplantation issues, this cure could be fatal. Undergoing open chest surgery places tremendous strain on the body. Recovery times are measured in months and years; after a transplant, immunosuppressant drugs can be required for the rest of a patient&#x2019;s life. When an avoidable infection requires high-dose therapy or even revision surgery (to replace an infected valve), quality of life doesn&#x2019;t suffer- it plummets.

Healthcare doesn&#x2019;t happen at a single point. Instead, it&#x2019;s an entire web of researchers, manufacturers, drug makers and care providers that work together to keep you and your loved ones safe and healthy. This network is held to higher standard of care because it all supports to most vital part of our world- our loved ones. When any party is negligent, from design to manufacturing to diagnoses, real people suffer real consequences. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight against negligent healthcare providers and protect patients&#x2019; rights.

In an interview with the Akron Beacon Journal, one on-staff RN said &#x201C;I&#x2019;m astonished by how much [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][the USACS physicians] don&#x2019;t know about how to take care of patients. It&#x2019;s mind-blowing.&#x201D;

This is not a charge to be leveled lightly. Akron City Hospital has a Level 1 trauma emergency department. The <a href="http://www.amtrauma.org/?page=traumalevels">American Trauma Society</a> defines that as &#x201C;a comprehensive regional resource... capable of providing total care for every aspect of injury &#x2013; from prevention through rehabilitation.&#x201D; Level 1 centers don&#x2019;t rely on any other facilities or hospitals; they are capable of handling all manner of healthcare needs and emergencies in-house.

It is safe to assume, therefore, that if you are being treated at a Level 1 center, you should be met by skilled, trained doctors and nurses who can correctly diagnose and treat whatever illness or injury you have. But according to the nursing staff at Akron City Hospital, there is no guarantee of this when you enter their center; instead, there have been multiple errors made in the emergency room. The <em>Beacon Journal</em> reports:

&#x201C;The nurses said they have witnessed and intervened when some of the new doctors delayed time-sensitive treatment for stroke patients, prescribed potentially fatal overdoses of common drugs like insulin and heart medication and misread EKGs, a medical test that can reveal whether someone is having a heart attack.&#x201D;
<h2>What&#x2019;s wrong with the doctors in the ER at Akron City Hospital?</h2>
This problem all started with a contract dispute. For forty years, a group of doctors (the Summa Emergency Associates) staffed the ER. In December, the negotiations between the SEA and Summa, the parent company of the hospital, failed. Summa chose to contract with US Acute Care Solutions (USACS) instead.

Since then, the nurses have seen increased delays in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke victims and heart attack sufferers, and a constant turn-over of the staff. Many of the ER doctors now serving Akron City Hospital come from out-of-state, and work for a few days at a time. There is no time to develop any kind of relationship with the patients, and many of the nurses claims they don&#x2019;t know what happens to patients once they leave the nurses&#x2019; care.

It is also worth noting that &#x201C;In February, a national accreditation board <strong>stripped Summa of its ability to train emergency medicine residents beginning July 1</strong>&#x201D; (emphasis ours). Those who claim that the problems in the ER of Akron City Hospital are just the &#x201C;normal&#x201D; kinds of problems that accompany big changes will do well to remember that residents are the step between interns and physicians. Without proper training, they will be unprepared to work in an ER &#x2013; and unable to be licensed to do so, either.

Yet because of the turn-over with attending physicians, it is these residents who are essentially running the ER at Akron City Hospital.
<h2>Delayed diagnosis is a type of medical malpractice</h2>
It only takes minutes for brain cells to start dying, leaving a patient with permanent brain damage. This is why accurate and swift diagnosis of conditions like stroke is critical to the process. Over the last few months, Akron City Hospital&#x2019;s &#x201C;door-to-needle&#x201D; time has increased, on average, by nine minutes. That is a life-threatening amount of time for someone who has suffered a stroke. Being unable to diagnose a stroke, and/or taking too much time to treat a patient with the symptoms of a stroke, is medical malpractice. The <em>Beacon Journal</em> does not report whether or not anyone has died at Akron City Hospital as a result of the changeover this year, but the nurses are clearly afraid &#x2013; enough so, that they are telling their own family members and friends to avoid the ER if they can.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we believe that every patient has the right to the best possible healthcare. We also believe that this story needs further investigation by an outside source, not just someone from Summa. If the Akron City Hospital really is in such tumult, patients&#x2019; lives could be at risk.

Jeopardy was still in the first round for the evening, and bedtime was a mere twenty minutes away for dozens of grade school students. A minute later, the world rocked on its foundations for almost 30 square miles; a house at the corner of Courtland Avenue and South Hawkins Avenue had violently exploded. First responders found the structure virtually flattened and an unidentified man in his 30s bleeding and covered in burns in the yard.
<h2>A massive explosion</h2>
The Akron Beacon Journal reported, &#x201C;Firefighters are investigating, but [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][Akron Fire Department spokesman Michael] Brooks said the explosion was likely caused by natural gas. People were evacuated from nearby homes, and gas and electric workers were on the scene as late at 9:30 p.m. trying to cut off the gas as the fire burned on.&#x201D;

It was determined that the explosion was most likely intentionally caused by the man first responders rescued from the yard. That man, one Rodney Hylton, was charged with aggravated arson (a first-degree felony) and later admitted to tampering with his stove&#x2019;s gas burners and a gas cap in an attempt at self-harm. Luckily, no one other than Hylton was injured in the explosion. However, the incident does serve to highlight a little known fact about natural gas lines; namely, that gas leaks are everywhere.
<h2>Infrastructure isn&#x2019;t just bridges and tunnels</h2>
Last year, Nicholas Kawa wrote an article for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/gas-leaks-are-everywhere/405820/">The Atlantic</a> about his experience checking gas lines in Chicago suburbs during high school. He was surprised to learn that, &#x201C;The bulk of the gas leaks identified are left leaking. Those between five to 15 feet from a house or structure would receive a check-up after six months. Leaks more than 15 feet from a building were noted but required no special attention. Many of the leaks persisted for years and even decades.&#x201D;

Luckily, natural gas explosions are fairly rare; leaks generally have to occur in an enclosed space to have any chance of causing an explosion. When gas leaks do lead to an explosion, however, those explosions tend to cause catastrophic injuries. Natural gas explosions can cause concussion injuries and internal and external burns. However, it&#x2019;s not just the heat and force of the concussion that cause problems; an explosion sets up a shockwave that propagates through the air around it. These shockwaves travel at tremendous speeds and move through anything in their path; objects are thrown, glass is shattered, and every object in the immediate area becomes a dangerous projectile. Whether explosions are an act of arson or an act of God, serious injuries are often the result.

If your loved one was seriously injured because of someone else&#x2019;s negligence, you may be entitled to compensation for medical bills, lost wages and other damages. The experienced Ohio catastrophic injury lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

When the group takes a stand, it does so knowing that it has the power of nearly half a million people behind it. That is why this letter from Thomas M. Susman, Director of the ABA&#x2019;s Governmental Affairs Office, to Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Ranking Member John Coyers, Jr., of the House Judiciary Committee, expressing opposition to HR 1215: Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, is so powerful &#x2013; and so important.

Crandall &amp; Pera Law has gone on record stating the dangers of HR 1215, and we stand with the ABA. The myth of tort reform as a measure for good is pervasive, and fighting it has been an uphill battle. Despite ample evidence to the contrary, legislators in this country still believe the lies that &#x201C;frivolous&#x201D; lawsuits are contributing in any way to the rising costs of healthcare.

In fact, a new study shows paid medical <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-03-paid-medical-malpractice-decrease.html" target="_blank">malpractice claims are decreasing</a>, not increasing. Tort reform was dreamed up by the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecohen/2015/03/02/on-tort-reform-its-time-to-declare-victory-and-withdraw/#6e60ee9363ea" target="_blank">insurance companies</a> as a way to avoid accountability to their own customers. Medical malpractice lawsuits contribute to, at best, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-another-study-shows-why-tort-reform--20140919-column.html" target="_blank">2% to 3%</a> of the cost of healthcare. The only thing tort reform will reliably do is hurt victims.

HR 1215 has nothing to do with helping people and everything to do with helping negligent doctors and insurance companies avoid accountability by, among other things:
<ul>
    <li>Limiting all non-economic damages to $250,000, regardless of the severity of the injury</li>
    <li>Making all claims federal claims, thus preempting states&#x2019; rights</li>
    <li>Limiting the amount the victim&#x2019;s attorney can be paid, with no limitation on the amount the doctor or his/her insurer can pay their lawyer</li>
</ul>
We encourage you to read the full text of the letter to the committee, and take a stand with us and with the American bar Association. Please <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/" target="_blank">contact your representatives</a> and tell them that patients matter more than paychecks. Vote No on HR 1215, and protect your rights, and the rights of victims throughout the country.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5778" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/New-Bill-Would-Remove-Effective-Checks-on-Medical-Malpractice-300x200.jpg" alt="new-bill-would-remove-effective-checks-on-medical-malpractice" width="300" height="200">The new federal Congress in Washington is now considering passage of a bill that would limit the right of injured victims in health-related cases to get more than $250,000 in non-economic damages. Any newborn whose life is tragically altered because a birth doctor&#x2019;s negligence caused the newborn to have cerebral palsy, or any person who is paralyzed for life because of medical error, will only be allowed at most a quarter million dollars for a life-time of suffering. If a doctor fails to diagnose cancer, thus preventing early detection that could have saved the patient&#x2019;s life, the most the cancer victim can ever get is $250,000.
<h2>Economic and non-economic damages</h2>
Economic damages are the medical costs to pay for hospital surgeries, doctor visits, and medications necessitated by medical errors. Economic damages can also include the amount of income a victim loses because of the doctor&#x2019;s or hospital&#x2019;s negligence.

Non-economic damage compensates a patient for severely altering his or her quality of life through error or negligence. It includes:
<ul>
    <li>The daily physical bodily pains and aches that can be excruciating for some victims.</li>
    <li>The loss of life&#x2019;s pleasures, such as being able to teach a child, go to a baseball game with that child, or even walking a daughter down the aisle for her wedding.</li>
    <li>The emotional anxiety of worrying about one&#x2019;s health and how a person will need to rely on others for assistance.</li>
    <li>Depression, anxiety, and fear that often accompany catastrophic and serious injuries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lack of accountability</h2>
The dangers this new law proposes go beyond the rights of those who place their lives in the hands of doctors, hospitals, and nurses only to see their lives cut short or made worse. Fundamentally, economic damage awards are the only way to police bad doctors and poor hospitals.

It is the possibility and the reality of large damage awards&#x2014;that our Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice attorneys are adept at obtaining&#x2014;that make hospitals take the necessary steps to:
<ul>
    <li>Train their doctors and medical staff</li>
    <li>Make sure they have the best medical equipment</li>
    <li>Comply with federal, state, and local guidelines</li>
    <li>Meet the demands of federal and state medical associations</li>
</ul>
Medical malpractice law holds doctors accountable to:
<ul>
    <li>Stay current with the latest medical techniques</li>
    <li>Run through the full check-list of necessary and likely issues that may arise during surgery</li>
    <li>Get the right diagnosis</li>
    <li>Prepare properly for surgery</li>
    <li>Prescribe the correct treatment</li>
</ul>
$250,000 is simply not a sufficient deterrent. Most doctors and hospitals pay for insurance. While the premiums are high, they are supposed to be for a reason&#x2014;to make sure mistakes don&#x2019;t happen. Insurance companies have penalized doctors for making mistakes by demanding much higher premiums if mistakes are made or denying coverage altogether if it is clear the health care provider has a history of negligence.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we have seen how medical malpractice ruins lives. We believe limiting economic awards harms people who need the most help. We assert that a full jury award is the only way to prevent doctors and hospitals from harming not only our clients but all patients who visit a hospital or doctor.

Before doctors or hospitals can prescribe any treatment, they have to know what it is wrong with the patient. They are supposed to be trained on which tests&#x2014;depending on the patient&#x2019;s symptoms and medical history&#x2014;to perform to make a proper diagnosis. Health care providers must read and assess those tests correctly. Physicians who make diagnostic errors can cause the patient to die, to suffer until the correct diagnosis is made, or to undergo unnecessary treatments and procedures.
<h2>Types of diagnostic errors</h2>
Health care providers can make the following types of health care mistakes:
<ul>
    <li><strong>An improper diagnosis or misdiagnosis.</strong> Doctors who make the wrong diagnosis of your illness don&#x2019;t provide the right treatments and don&#x2019;t correct your medical problems.</li>
    <li><strong>A failure to diagnose.</strong> Here the physician fails to make any diagnosis of your medical problem. He/she fails to recognize that you have cancer, for example.</li>
    <li><strong>A delay in the diagnosis</strong>. Delays in diagnosing a medical condition can cause your body to deteriorate and the disease to accelerate. Treatments that would have worked if the diagnosis was made quickly may fail when the diagnosis is too late. Delays are often caused by a failure to order MRIs, blood work, biopsies, or other tests in a timely manner.</li>
</ul>
Diagnostic errors include failure to read the test results correctly, using improper equipment, mixing up your blood work with that of another patient, and many other errors. Competent Ohio medical malpractice lawyers work with experienced medical professional to determine if a diagnostic error occurred.
<h2>Medical conditions that are often worsened by diagnostic error</h2>
A defective diagnosis at best means that additional surgeries, treatments, and medications will be required. At worst, it means a patient never fully recovers or dies. Some common examples of diagnostic error are:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cardiology errors.</strong> Patients with chest pains, dizziness, and other heart attack or stroke symptoms should be treated for heart disease and not heartburn or migraines. Quick attention can save a life.</li>
    <li>A failure to order the right tests, such as biopsies, can delay the necessary treatment. The difference between treating stage-2 cancer and stage-3 cancer can be the difference between life and death.</li>
    <li>Chest X-Rays are not the sole determining factor in diagnosing or ruling out pneumonia. A full set of appropriate tests should be ordered if pneumonia is suspected.</li>
    <li><strong>Cerebral Palsy (CP).</strong> This condition is often diagnosed incorrectly. Some children with CP are not properly diagnosed and some children who don&#x2019;t have CP are mistakenly diagnosed with the condition.</li>
    <li><strong>Fungal lung infections.</strong> This condition, also called aspergillosis, is often misdiagnosed.</li>
</ul>
Sometimes, the correct diagnosis has to be made during surgery. A failure to treat the right problem, during pregnancy for example, can lead to birth defects, infections, preeclampsia, and endanger the life of the child and the mother.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice lawyers have helped many medical malpractice patients get justice in the form of multi-million dollar verdicts against doctors and hospitals who commit medical error.

Commercial vehicles are different than other cars and smaller trucks. Drivers of commercial vehicles must have a commercial driver&#x2019;s license (CDL). Generally, a driver who obtains an Ohio commercial driver&#x2019;s license can drive in Kentucky and every other U.S. state (and vice versa). In order to obtain and keep a commercial driver&#x2019;s license:
<ul>
    <li>The driver must complete an approved CDL training course</li>
    <li>The commercial driver must pass a test that meets federal and state standards</li>
    <li>The driver must have an approved medical authorization</li>
    <li>The driver&#x2019;s license must match the particular class of truck he/she is driving</li>
</ul>
Commercial drivers must meet additional requirements. Violations of these requirements can be useful in proving that the driver and the company that hired the driver were responsible for a truck accident. For example, most drivers who are pulled over for drunk driving will be found guilty if their blood alcohol content was .08. Commercial drivers can be found guilty if their blood alcohol content was just .04.

Commercial drivers must also comply with the federal and state driving laws that regulate how much the truck can weigh, how much rest the driver should get, how the truck cargo should be secured, and other safety factors. These safety rules apply to drivers on federal and state roads, such as Ohio Routes 23 and 33, Interstates 76, 75, and 480; the Western Kentucky Parkway, Kentucky Routes 7 and 9, and all other truck route roads.
<h2>Commercial truck classifications</h2>
Commercial vehicles are classified based on the following criteria:
<ul>
    <li>The Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of the truck</li>
    <li>Whether hazardous materials are being transported</li>
    <li>How many passengers are being transported</li>
</ul>
Commercial vehicles include semi-trucks, 18-wheelers, rigs, heavy trucks, vans, buses, tractor-trailers, and other large vehicles. When commercial vehicle accidents occur, the injuries that car passengers and motorcycle riders suffer are often deadly or quite severe. The weight, size, and dimensions of these commercial vehicles are simply no match for smaller automobiles and lighter vehicles.

If you were injured in a truck accident, our Ohio and Kentucky truck accident attorneys are experienced litigators. We understand what is needed to prove fault and all the damages that should be paid. You can reach our Ohio attorneys at 877-686-8879 and our Kentucky lawyers at 877-686-8879.

It changes their ability to function, to think, to communicate, and to socialize. It impacts their ability to perform daily physical activities. Catastrophic injuries include traumatic brain injury, spinal cord damage, paralysis, severe burns, loss of a limb, and permanent injuries. These severe injuries can be caused by vehicle accidents, accidents in the workplace, product defects, explosions, construction accidents, and other incidents.
<h2>Pain and suffering</h2>
In every type of accident, the victim has to endure substantial emotional issues as they attempt to heal. Common emotional trauma includes:
<ul>
    <li>Shock at realizing their stable life has now become unstable</li>
    <li>Anger at the people who caused the accident</li>
    <li>Anxiety about the status of their health</li>
    <li>Fear that they could experience another injury, or that a love one could be injured</li>
    <li>Distress at the toll their injuries are taking on family members</li>
    <li>Frustration at the inability to enjoy and teach children, spend time with parents, and live a daily mature life with their spouse</li>
</ul>
Many victims endure this suffering on their own. Some are able to get help from psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors
<h2>Why catastrophic Injuries are uniquely traumatic</h2>
For patients who are able to fully heal or resume most of their life&#x2019;s activities, the suffering does come to an end. For people with life-altering physical damages, the suffering will last for every day of the rest of their lives. Patients with catastrophic injuries sometimes need professional help to cope with the following issues and more, depending on their situation:
<ul>
    <li><strong>All of the problems other patients have &#x2013; but for a lifetime</strong>. This includes depression, confusion, and generally withdrawing from the world.</li>
    <li><strong>Thoughts of suicide.</strong> Victims who will never walk, talk, have physical relations, or who have body disfigurement sometimes think that life is not worth living.</li>
    <li><strong>Alcoholism and addiction.</strong> Many accident victims cope the wrong way &#x2013; by resorting to methods that they think provide relief but only worsen the harm, such as drugs and alcohol.</li>
</ul>
Patients who lose a limb may suffer phantom pain &#x2013; pain in the missing limb that is real in their mind. Some accident victims suffer post-traumatic stress disorder.

Verifying these extreme emotional difficulties requires that Kentucky catastrophic injury lawyers do more than work with the appropriate mental health professionals. Legal representatives must work with the victim by helping him/her explain what their daily life is like, with family members who can detail the victim&#x2019;s struggles, and with the physicians and doctors who can detail the physical cause of their pain.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our attorneys do all of this and more. If someone you love was severely injured or you are living with a catastrophic injury, we have decades of trial experience. For compassionate help, please call our Kentucky lawyers at 877-686-8879 or use our <a href="/Contact.shtml" target="_blank">contact form</a> to make an appointment.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6012" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Doctor-talking-to-patient-300x226.jpg" alt="Doctors and Hospitals Should Take Precautions to Prevent Cerebral Palsy" width="300" height="226">Cerebral palsy (CP) is a medical condition caused by brain damage that can forever alter the life of a newborn. &#x201C;Cerebral&#x201D; refers to the brain. &#x201C;Palsy&#x201D; refers to motor impairment. CP can range from mild to severe depending on the amount of damage to the brain.

If brain damage was caused during birth, and the medical professionals involved failed to take reasonable precautionary steps, these health providers can be held accountable for the lifetime of physical harm and emotional distress that this devastating condition causes. Our lawyers work with trained obstetricians and other doctors to determine what preventive measures should have been taken.

CP can result from untreated fetal distress, compression of the umbilical cord, the newborn being unable to comfortably pass through the birth canal, lack of oxygen to the brain, infection, and a shearing of the placenta. These problems should be anticipated and corrected by the birthing team to prevent any brain damage from occurring. Newborns and mothers should be constantly monitored before, during, and after the birth. Sometimes, a Caesarian section (C-section) is the best option to prevent complications.
<h2>Cerebral Palsy complications</h2>
According to <a href="http://www.cerebralpalsysource.com">Cerebral Palsy Source</a>, the problems individuals with CP experience depend on what part of their brain was damaged. The following difficulties are common:
<ul>
    <li>Spasticity or tightness of the muscles</li>
    <li>Difficulty walking</li>
    <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
    <li>Involuntary movements</li>
    <li>Speech, hearing, and visual problems</li>
    <li>Seizures</li>
    <li>Cognitive issues and learning disabilities</li>
</ul>
CP patients also may have problems with going to the bathroom, with breathing, and with their posture. Many also have disorders of the skin and pressure sores because of immobility issues.

Each year, there are about &#xBE; of a million children and adults who exhibit some form of CP. Close to 8,000 newborns are born with cerebral palsy. Many of these cases are due to birth injury malpractice.

The three main types of CP are:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Spastic CP.</strong> In this type of cerebral palsy, the muscle tissues are tight, causing problems with mobility.</li>
    <li><strong>Athetoid CP.</strong> This is also a movement disorder but, with this condition, movements and tics can&#x2019;t be controlled.</li>
    <li><strong>Ataxic</strong> People with this form of CP have balance and depth problems.</li>
</ul>
Mixed CP is a fourth classification reserved for children and adults who have some combination of the three main types.

Sadly, CP is not curable. There are treatments that can help, including physical therapy, wheelchairs, computer assistance, and medications.
<h2>United Cerebral Palsy Associations in Ohio</h2>
Three Ohio associations that help children and adults who are diagnosed with CP and their families are:
<ul>
    <li>UCP of Central Ohio, 440 Industrial Mile Road, Columbus, OH 43228-2411, Phone: (614) 279-0109</li>
    <li>UCP of Greater Cincinnati, 3601 Victory Parkway, Cincinnati, OH 45229, Phone: (513) 221-4606</li>
    <li>UCP of Greater Cleveland, 10011 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106, Phone: (216) 791-8363</li>
</ul>
There are other associations that can provide education and support throughout Ohio.

Our Ohio birth injury malpractice attorneys understand just how devastating a cerebral palsy diagnosis is for the child and the parents. Medical professionals who do not take reasonable precautions to prevent the complications that result in CP must be held accountable.

People can be killed because of a car accident, medical malpractice, defective products, or for many other reasons. The individuals and businesses responsible for these tragedies deserve to be held accountable for the loss of life they cause the victim. In Ohio, liable parties must also account for the lifetime of harm they cause the spouse, children, and parents because the life of a loved one was tragically and wrongfully cut short.
<h2>Ohio statutory damages</h2>
Wrongful death cases are brought by the personal representative of the victim&#x2019;s estate. If the victim had a will, then the personal representative is the executor/executrix named in the will. Otherwise, the personal representative is someone approved by the court&#x2014;typically a spouse, adult child, or parent.

The wrongdoers are liable for the following damages in wrongful death cases:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Funeral and burial costs.</strong> This sum is separate from the other damages.</li>
    <li><strong>The loss of financial support the accident victim would have reasonably provided the family.</strong> Typically, financial experts look at the decedent&#x2019;s work history, education, and skills to determine how much the person would have reasonably earned.</li>
    <li><strong>The loss of support the victim would have given the relatives.</strong> This includes items such as the value of housework and child care.</li>
    <li><strong>The loss of society of the decedent.</strong> This includes the loss of attention, protection, guidance, training, education, consortium (love and companionship), and other care that the spouse, children, or parents suffered.</li>
    <li><strong>The loss of any prospective inheritance to the victim&#x2019;s line of heirs</strong>. If, for example, a husband and father dies, any inheritance his parents or grandparents would have reasonably provided should be considered.</li>
</ul>
Another important measure of damages is the emotional anguish each relative who lost a loved one suffers.

Sometimes complex questions arise, such as what happens if a child was conceived before the victim&#x2019;s death but was born after death, or what happens if a spouse has remarried. An experienced Ohio wrongful death lawyer can readily answer these difficult questions.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our attorneys fight to give bereaved family members every dollar Ohio law allows. To make an appointment with one of our caring advocates, please call us at 877-686-8879 or fill out our <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact form</a>.

Think about it like this; you&#x2019;re at a friend&#x2019;s house and suddenly come down with a headache. They offer you a prescription ibuprofen or a Tylenol-3. Both are common medications, both are fairly similar and both are very likely to knock out that headache in short order. Most of us wouldn&#x2019;t think twice.
<h2>Only take medications prescribed for you</h2>
Some medications, particularly the ones most commonly prescribed to the elderly for chronic conditions or <a href="https://www.patientsrightsblog.com/first-decrease-american-life-expectancy-two-decades/" target="_blank">chronic pain management</a>, are far from innocuous. Taking one of grandma&#x2019;s pills for your headache might actually knock you out. Prescription drugs aren&#x2019;t a joke, and you shouldn&#x2019;t take anything that doesn&#x2019;t have your name on it specifically. Fentanyl patches (or pills, or lollipops, or any other formulation) are in a league of their own. The opioid is so potent that it can cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness and other symptoms in less than 20 minutes in those who don&#x2019;t need it.

Fentanyl is considered a necessary evil, but it carries serious risks. Simply having the patches around the house can put everyone at risk of accidental overdose; the drug is <em>eighty times</em> more potent than morphine. The patches are designed to release a controlled amount of the drug over time to be absorbed by the skin. If they are punctured or damaged in any way, direct exposure can quickly cause serious problems.
<h2>The real risk of chronic pain management</h2>
Worse, the drug is becoming the new hot item on the streets. Its potency has placed it in high demand, with addicts looking to cancer patients and the elderly as a supply. Whether your concern is properly caring for your loved one or watching out for signs of abuse, it pays to know what to look for. Seek emergency medical attention if you notice:
<ul>
    <li>Slow heart rate, sighing, weak or shallow breathing (up to several days after removing the skin patch)</li>
    <li>Chest pain, fast or pounding heartbeats</li>
    <li>Extreme drowsiness or dizziness</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, when fentanyl is around, the problems only seem to increase. The drug can cause confusion and cognitive changes, and long-term use can lead to tolerance issues. Sudden cessation can cause addiction issues. When your loved one is prescribed fentanyl, constant communication is of the utmost importance. Doctors, patients, and family members should all be aware of the risks of fentanyl to both patients and others.

If chronic pain management has left your loved one with tolerance, hypersensitivity, or addiction issues, you may be entitled to compensation for medical malpractice. The experienced Kentucky and Ohio medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can evaluate your case and help get you the compensation you deserve.

BODY:
The Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, and the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration, have been warning hospitals, medical centers, and doctors about contaminated heater-cooler devices used in cardiothoracic surgery. These devices appear to have left their manufacturing plant already contaminated with <em>non-tuberculous mycobacteria</em> (NTM), and a design defect is alleged to allow the bacteria to spread.
<h2>What are non-tuberculous mycobacteria?</h2>
NTM are slow-growing bacteria that are commonly found in soil and water samples. They are usually harmless, and most people will not be infected by these bacteria simply from touching the water or soil. However, when you develop an NTM infection which is goes undiagnosed and untreated, you could become very ill; in some cases, these bacteria have proven deadly.
<h2>How is the infection spreading?</h2>
The heater-cooler devices (HCDs) left their manufacturing plant in Germany already contaminated with bacteria, so the risk of infection already existed in any facility that uses Sorin/ St&#xF6;ckert 3T HCDs. The bacteria incubate in the water, and then aerosolize through the exhaust system. Even in cases where the doctors have done everything correctly, patients were at risk.

However, the most likely reason is a lapse in protocol. Hospital acquired infections, also known as healthcare associated infections, are a significant problem in facilities throughout Kentucky and Ohio. The FDA had to issue a list of recommendations about how to properly sterilize the equipment and the rooms where these HCDs were used, which indicates that the bacteria are being spread from person to person. Since NTM normally do not spread in this way, there must be some kind of direct contact.
<h2>Signs and symptoms of non-tuberculous mycobacteria</h2>
Most NTM infections present with flu-like symptoms, including:
<ul>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
    <li>Night sweats</li>
    <li>Muscle pain</li>
    <li>Weight loss</li>
</ul>
Some people may also experience swelling and tenderness in their skin, and may see pus or discharge.
<h2>Why are doctors failing to diagnose NTM in patients?</h2>
NTM may incubate inside of a person for years before that person exhibits any symptoms. If you underwent surgery six years ago, and then go to the doctor for relief from what you think is the flu, that doctor may fail to diagnose the problem.

However, the CDC and FDA has been issuing safety warnings about possible contamination since 2015 &#x2013; yet hospitals throughout Ohio and Kentucky are only now sending out letters that point to potential infection. It is worth asking what it took them so long to warn their patients that they could be harboring deadly bacteria.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we protect the rights of people who have sustained injuries or developed illnesses because of defective medical devices. If you or your loved one developed a potentially deadly infection after a procedure with a Sorin/ St&#xF6;ckert 3T heater-cooler device, we want to help.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6102" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/informed-consent-204x300.jpg" alt="informed consent" width="204" height="300">Doctors and hospitals have a duty to inform their patients about the benefits and risks of any treatment or medical procedure. Patients rely on health care providers to explain the known health risks. If a doctor or hospital fails to properly inform a patient, they can be sued for medical malpractice. Patients, except in certain emergencies, have the right to decide what risks they are going to take with their body, even if the treatment or procedure is likely to improve their health.

According to the <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/sites/default/files/media-browser/code-of-medical-ethics-chapter-2.pdf">American Medical Association</a>, there are six key informed consent considerations. Patients have a right to know the following:
<ol>
    <li>The diagnosis of their condition or illness &#x2013; if known</li>
    <li>The reason for the proposed treatment, procedure, or surgery</li>
    <li>The pros and cons of each treatment or medical procedure</li>
    <li>What alternatives are available</li>
    <li>The benefits and dangers of the alternatives</li>
    <li>What is likely to happen if the patient declines to undergo the treatment or procedure</li>
</ol>
<h2>There are exceptions:</h2>
In some cases, doctors can proceed without informed consent or can get consent from people other than the patient:
<ul>
    <li>Parents or guardians must be informed and give consent for minor children.</li>
    <li>If a life-threating emergency exists and you are not mentally or physically able to give consent, medical professionals should generally proceed with treatment.</li>
    <li>If the patient is not mentally able to give informed consent, a family member or guardian may give consent in the patient&#x2019;s place.</li>
</ul>
The best way to advise the patient is by putting the benefits and risks of each possible treatment in writing and getting the patient to sign it. In Ohio, a patient needs to sign a consent form, unless he or she is not mentally or physically capable of doing so. In Kentucky, patients do not have to sign the paper to give consent. A patient can give also give oral consent. Consent may also be implied from circumstances, such as if an emergency arises during a surgery. If the patient does consent to the surgery, then it is implied that the doctor can try to save the patient&#x2019;s life during the operation if unexpected circumstances arise. The doctor must still proceed according to reasonable medical standards. Consent is not a license to make mistakes.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our Kentucky and Ohio medical malpractice attorneys demand compensation for any medical bills, lost wages, and pain and suffering the patient endures because they were treated against their wishes.

Any health provider who provides negligent care that injures a patient can be sued for medical malpractice. Health providers include doctors, hospitals, nurses, medical technicians, emergency health providers, and anyone who counsels or treats the patient. Medical malpractice is a legal term of art that has precise requirements. Experienced Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice attorneys understand which requirements apply for their respective states.
<h2>The key elements of a medical malpractice claim</h2>
In order to hold the health provider liable for negligence or malpractice, each of the following items must be proved:
<ul>
    <li><strong>The establishment a doctor-patient relationship.</strong> Usually, the relationship can be demonstrated by the forms and admissions papers patients sign before the health provider sees the patient.</li>
    <li><strong>Showing that the health provider did not meet the appropriate standard of care.</strong> This requirement has two parts:
<ul>
    <li><strong>The standard of care for the doctor or hospital.</strong> The standard is the amount and types of skill that a prudent doctor with reasonably careful similar training would have. Family doctors are compared to similar family doctors. Neurosurgeons are compared to similar neurosurgeons. Family doctors are not required to have the skill of a neurosurgeon, however. This is a lot of legalese for saying, &#x201C;What procedures and treatments would a similarly trained doctor have provided?&#x201D;</li>
    <li><strong>How the provider failed to meet the standard of care. </strong>A qualified medical witness must then explain how specifically the defendant failed to meet the standard of care that was expected.</li>
    <li><strong>Proximate cause.</strong> It must be shown that the negligence of the doctor, the below-standard care, caused the patient physical harm.</li>
    <li><strong>Harm to the patient.</strong> Here, the medical witness will normally explain what injuries the patient sustained, what medical steps need to be taken to improve the patient&#x2019;s condition and maintain his/her health, and what physical pain and emotional suffering the patient will endure &#x2013; and for how long.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
A major reason for employing the highly skilled medical malpractice lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law is that we have the resources and network to retain medical professionals who understand your injuries, or those of a loved one, and who know how to present the medical testimony in court.

The accident happened around 2:30 am, shutting down one of the eastbound lanes for a good part of the morning. At least one person was transported to a hospital. Police from local departments and a hazardous materials crew were called out to clear the roads and clean up the diesel fuel spilled from the trucks.
<h2>Why large trucks rollover</h2>
The most common reason for an 18-wheeler, commercial truck, van, or other truck rollover is going too fast through a curve. The physical size and dimensions of a truck make them much tougher to control than a smaller vehicle when speeding through a turn. Trucks also have a different center of gravity than cars, making them more susceptible to rollovers. Truck drivers who fail to slow down around a curve should be held accountable for any injuries they cause. The owners of the truck and any truck companies that improperly pressured the truck driver to go too fast for conditions should also be held liable for deaths and physical injuries.

Other reasons trucks rollover include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Brake failure.</strong> Here, the manufacturer of the brakes can be held responsible.</li>
    <li><strong>Over-steering.</strong> This is normally due to the failure of the driver to pay attention and then overcompensate when a traffic danger arises.</li>
    <li><strong>Drunk or distracted driving.</strong> Both can cause the driver to lose control of the truck.</li>
    <li><strong>Faulty loading of the cargo.</strong> Cargo that is not properly secured, or that is too heavy or large for the truck, can shift while the truck driver is operating the truck, causing the operator to lose control or causing the center of gravity of the truck to shift.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dangers to other drivers when a truck overturns</h2>
When a truck rolls over, the driver and any passengers of surrounding vehicles that are hit can die or suffer catastrophic injuries, such as traumatic brain injury or spinal cord damage. Other drivers and passengers on the road can be injured as they attempt to navigate around the overturned truck if they collide with other vehicles, strike road barriers, or flip over themselves.

When trucks rollover, their cargo is likely to spill. Spilled cargo can strike oncoming vehicles in the windshield or other parts of the car. The vehicle occupants can also be hurt as they attempt to avoid the spilled shipments. If the cargo has hazardous material, that material can ignite, causing complete havoc and multiple tragedies.

Truck overturn cases are very complex because the truck flip is normally just the start of a chain reaction of lethal events. Sorting out responsibility requires the experienced of highly skilled Ohio truck accident lawyers.

BODY:
The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/heater-cooler.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) is currently telling cardiologists and hospitals that heater-cooler devices used during heart surgery pose risk for serious medical complications. The dangers exist because many of these devices may have been contaminated in the manufacturing process.

The risks include life-endangering infections, weight loss, fatigue, unexplained fever, aches, and night sweats. The primary device that has the CDC and the health community alarmed is the PLC St&#xF6;ckert 3T heater-cooler device (HCD) made by LivaNova, previously called the Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH. About 3/5 of all heart bypass surgeries in Ohio and Kentucky use a Sorin /St&#xF6;ckert 3T heater-cooler.

Heater-cooler machines are used during heart bypass surgeries to keep the blood and organs of the cardiology patient at just the right temperature. The CDC indicates that bacterial infection is a risk during any heart procedure. The use of the HCD increases that risk. In particular, the heater-coolers are known to risk an <em>M. chimaera</em> infection, which is caused by the water tanks the device uses to monitor the temperatures.

    <li>What the Sorin 3T Contamination Debacle Means for Infected Patients</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why you may have a medical malpractice case</h2>
The dangers posed by these devices are serious. Individuals who have been harmed can bring claims against all responsible parties, including:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sorin, LivaNova, and all related entities involved in the manufacture and sale of the defective heater-coolers</strong>. These product liability claims are brought on the theory that the device is defective and that the defect is causing serious harm and endangering lives.</li>
    <li><strong>The doctors who use the defective devices.</strong> Doctors can be sued for medical malpractice for failing to use alternative heater-coolers, now that the dangers of Sorin heater-coolers are well known, and also for failing to take proper sanity precautions. The physicians can also be held liable if they fail to fully inform the patient of the risks of using the device and if they do not obtain an informed written consent, even if the risks are disclosed verbally.</li>
    <li><strong>The hospital where the heart bypass was performed.</strong> Hospitals can be held liable on the same medical malpractice grounds as their doctors. They can be found responsible for not fully informing their doctors of the dangers of the HCDs or for failing to supervise their doctors responsibly.</li>
</ul>
The manufacturers of the Sorin heater-cooler can also be found liable if they were negligent or if they breached any express or implied warranties.

If you are suffering, or a loved one died due to a defective Sorin/St&#xF6;ckert 3T heater, our product defect lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can explain if you have grounds for a claim.

The accident happened near Max Hurt Drive while the semi-truck was stopped at a red light. Mr. Brown&#x2019;s vehicle was partially pinned under the trailer. The Murray Police Department, Murray Fire Department, a local emergency medical service, and other state and local agencies helped extricate Mr. Brown so he could be flown to Vanderbilt Hospital for medical care.
<h2>The dangers of truck underride accidents</h2>
Large trucks, such as semis, have a high clearance area under the body of the truck. Many cars that rear-end this type of truck slide under it because the hood of the car is lower than the clearance height. Even the roofs of some cars can slide under the truck, pining the entire car. Often, the hood or windshield will shear off the car, causing additional dangers for any occupants of the smaller vehicle. Cars who strike a large commercial truck from the side can also slide under the truck&#x2019;s carriage.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) does require that commercial trucks have rear-underride guards. The guards are supposed to stop cars from sliding under the truck. There are no NHTSA standards, though. The quality of the guards is dependent on the manufacturer and which vendor the truck owner uses. The NHTSA does not currently require side guards.

Truck underride accidents can cause death, traumatic brain injuries, broken bones, amputations, and other life-threating and long-term physical harm. Damages in these types of crashes include payment of all hospital and doctor bills, lost wages, pain and suffering, scarring and disfigurement, and other expenses such as medications. If the truck owner failed to have guards on the truck, punitive damages can also be sought.

Even though the car driver rear-ended the truck, the trucking company and the manufacturer of any guard rails on the truck may be liable for turning what should have been a minor accident into a major one.

If you were hurt, or someone you know was killed due to a truck underride accident, the Kentucky truck accident lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law have the experience you need. We have the resources and skills to hold all responsible parties accountable for wrongful death and serious injuries. For help now, please call us at 877.651.7764.

The CFC is the modern incarnation of the oldest Court in American history (established in 1855). There are 16 judges, nominated by the President, who serve for 15-year terms. Unlike other courts in the civil justice system, the CFC does not convene juries; rather, decisions are made by the judges themselves in what is known as a &#x201C;bench trial.&#x201D;

The <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/about-court" target="_blank">Court makes rulings</a> in cases where citizens have claims against the U.S. government, and &#x201C;is authorized to hear primarily money claims founded upon the Constitution, federal statutes, executive regulations, or contracts, express or implied in fact, with the United States.&#x201D; Because its jurisdiction reaches throughout the country, it hears cases throughout the U.S.
<h2>Claims under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act</h2>
Because Steve Crandall is now admitted to practice in the CFC, he is able to represent clients seeking compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. This &#x201C;Act establishes the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program under which individuals may bring claims for alleged vaccine-related injuries or deaths&#x201D; in <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/faqs" target="_blank">front of the Office of Special Masters</a>.

In layman&#x2019;s terms, this means that if you or your loved one was given a vaccine &#x2013; like a flu shot, or an MMR shot, for example &#x2013; that resulted in a severe allergic reaction, or that was found to be defective or dangerous in some way, you may be entitled to compensation from the VICP. Because these are federal claims in a special court, you must be represented by an attorney, like Steve Crandall, who has been admitted to practice in that court.

You can find the full list of covered vaccines here.

Crandall &amp; Pera Law is extremely proud of Steve for this accomplishment. Only a handful of attorneys from each state are admitted to practice in front of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. It is a testament to his advocacy for, and dedication to, his clients&#x2019; best interests that he was admitted to practice in front of such a venerable Court. We offer a heartfelt &#x201C;congratulations,&#x201D; and believe that injury victims in Ohio and Kentucky can rest easier, knowing he is on their side.

The truck driver was crossing the railroad tracks when the impact of the crash caused the truck to end up in the front yard of a nearby house. The police indicated that the lights and gates at the crossing appeared to be in working condition. None of the 73 passengers on the Amtrak train were injured, though they were delayed for several hours as police investigated the accident.
<h2>Accidents involving mass transit vehicles result in complex claims</h2>
Cases like this one begin with an investigation by the police who are called to the train accident location. In train crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will also be alerted to the crash and will conduct an investigation. The goal of this investigation is to determine fault, as well as to prevent future accidents from happening.

Kentucky truck accident lawyers hired to represent victims will employ their own investigators to speak with witnesses, review the reports of the police and the NTSB, and to conduct their own review of the accident site. In appropriate cases, the lawyers may also hire an accident reconstruction expert to determine fault.

In this type of case, the investigation will be two-fold. The first part of the review will be to examine the liability of the driver. Did he stop before entering the tracks? Was he intoxicated, distracted, or fatigued? Was he speeding, or otherwise in violation of traffic safety laws?

The second half of the investigation will be focused on determining if the site of the accident itself had a part to play in causing the accident. Considerations include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Previous injuries at the train site. </strong>Prior accidents at this site would indicate the crossing may not have been maintained properly and that someone should have done the necessary maintenance.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspection reports of lights and guard crossings</strong>. The apparatus at the train crossing should be regularly inspected to ensure proper functioning.</li>
    <li><strong>The site itself may have been poorly designed</strong>. Trucks and vehicles should have warnings that train tracks are a short distance away. The crossing should be visible and not hidden by trees, bushes, or other obstructions.</li>
</ul>
In this case, the only known victim is the deceased. If Amtrak or any other entities were responsible for the accident, the family of the deceased truck driver would have the right to bring a wrongful death action against the responsible companies.

Families of deceased drivers sometimes believe they do not have a case. However, the Kentucky truck accident lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law thoroughly investigate these cases to ensure your family receives justice. &#xA0;If your spouse, parent, or child was killed or suffered a catastrophic injury, retain competent counsel to advocate on your behalf. Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help you get justice. To make an appointment, please phone us at 877.651.7764 or fill out our <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact form</a>.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6083" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unconstitutional-1-300x199.jpg" alt="damage caps on malpractice cases" width="300" height="199">Pending legislation seeks to compromise the rights of medical malpractice victims, preventing them from obtaining just compensation for their injuries. This is most apparent in federal law, HR 1215, which proposes that non-economic damages be capped at $250,00 for any medical malpractice claim that involves a federal program, tax benefit, or subsidy.

This federal legislation has not been passed to date, but states are beginning to follow suit. A recent <a href="http://www.radioiowa.com/2017/05/05/iowa-law-caps-non-economic-damages-in-medical-malpractice-suits/" target="_blank">law</a> that was passed in Iowa limits victims&#x2019; ability to obtain full justice for negligent and irresponsible conduct by doctors and hospitals. Now, when Iowa children and families suffer any type of physical or mental harm&#x2014;except in cases causing catastrophic disability or death&#x2014;the doctors and hospitals responsible will only have to pay a maximum of $250,000 for non-economic damages, such as pain and suffering.
<h2>Why the new Iowa law and others like it are so hurtful to innocent victims</h2>
Iowa Governor Terry Branstad signed the new medical damage reduction law even though the Governor and the Iowa Congress are fully aware that it does nothing to protect medical malpractice victims who suffer harm through no fault of their own. The fault for their injuries lies with negligent doctors who were poorly trained, fatigued, made an improper diagnosis, or otherwise failed in their duty of care. Iowa&#x2019;s new law caps pain and suffering losses at $250,000 unless the patient dies, loses major bodily functions, or becomes substantially disfigured.

The potential for inadequate compensation to victims is just one issue that makes this law so troubling. What&#x2019;s more, the law does nothing to deter doctors from making the same mistakes and hurting other patients.
<h2>HR 1215 poses heightened threat to malpractice victims nationwide</h2>
Iowa&#x2019;s new medical malpractice cap is just the tip of the iceberg. HR 1215 involves, at minimum:
<ul>
    <li>A $250,000 federal limit applied to all medical malpractice cases, regardless of how severe the injury is.</li>
    <li>Protection for doctors and hospitals who give defective drugs to patients, even if they are jointly responsible for the patient&#x2019;s death or injury.</li>
    <li>Severe limits on legal fees, which directly threatens the ability to bring a medical malpractice claim.</li>
</ul>
The U.S. Congress is also working to end class-action lawsuits, which protect patients by holding drug and medical device manufacturers accountable for putting profit ahead of product safety.

Unfortunately, this nightmare scenario is a reality for some parents of children who have suffered a ruptured blood vessel in their skull during a traumatic or difficult birth.

Known as cephalohematoma, this condition affects <a href="http://mddk.com/cephalohematoma.html" target="_blank">1 in 50</a> infants in the US. Rather than being a biological problem, cephalohematoma is caused by the improper actions of medical practitioners during delivery, through the aggressive use of a vacuum or forceps. The majority of babies who suffer this injury during birth recover with no lasting damage in about three months. The damage is not to the brain itself, but to the skull and surrounding tissue. However, during the recovery process, the tissue damage looks nearly identical to the damage of other, more serious conditions, which can only be ruled out via radiography or CT scanning.

Not every case of cephalohematoma is resolved without issue. Some babies suffer more serious bleeding and require blood transfusions, and any infant with the condition is more prone to jaundice.&#xA0; In some cases, the condition accompanies a more severe skull fracture. Risk factors for developing a cephalohematoma include:
<ul>
    <li>Difficult or prolonged delivery</li>
    <li>Use of forceps or vacuum extraction</li>
    <li>Maternal vitamin C deficiency</li>
    <li>Large infant head size compared to maternal pelvis</li>
    <li>First pregnancy</li>
</ul>
It is the responsible of the physician to identify and anticipate these issues and take appropriate precautions. Failure to do so is a demonstration of negligence on the doctor&#x2019;s part.
<h2><strong><em>This birth injury can mimic the symptoms of abuse</em></strong></h2>
Some parents may not be aware that their babies have a cephalohematoma until a well-baby visit or other medical assessment. In the Virginia case of <a href="http://wset.com/news/local/mom-charged-with-child-abuse-claims-medical-records-prove-injuries-happened-at-birth" target="_blank">Crystal Good,e</a> that is exactly what happened. Rather than recognizing the bump and surrounding bruise as a relatively innocuous cephalohematoma, her pediatrician called the police, and Goode was charged with felony child abuse. Testimony was given that the injury was consistent with a fall from at least three stories or a high-speed car accident. Birth records, however, clearly indicate that Goode&#x2019;s infant suffered a cephalohematoma during delivery. Unfortunately, Goode pleaded guilty prior to these records being checked, and still faces a sentence of two to 10 years in prison. While she is currently free on bond, Goode is not allowed to have unrestricted access to the baby or her other four children.

If your infant has suffered a cephalohematoma during delivery, contact the experienced Kentucky and Ohio birth injury lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law. Our attorneys work to get you and your child the compensation you deserve.

His vehicle crashed into to a tanker truck, causing a spectacular explosion. The wreck was caught on film and showed that the collision caused a huge fireball. The driver going the wrong way was killed. The driver of the tanker was fortunate to escape the incident with minor injuries. Officers had to let the fire run its course before they could apply foam and begin to manage the Interstate. Traffic had to be shut down in both directions at parts of the Dayton Interstate, and a hazardous materials unit was called to the accident scene.
<h2>Liability issues in this type of case</h2>
The driver may have been going the wrong way for several reasons &#x2013; each of which could have caused the collision. Some of the issues an experienced Ohio truck accident lawyer would explore are:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Was the driver intoxicated</strong>? Anyone who operates a vehicle while drunk suffers compromised control of his mental and physical abilities. Seriously intoxicated drivers may fail to realize they are driving on the wrong side of the road until it is too late. When a driver is killed at the accident site, a blood test, if possible, may be used to determine blood alcohol level. The driver&#x2019;s whereabouts before the crash can also be investigated.</li>
</ul>
The family of the driver may have a wrongful death dram shop claim against any vendor that served the wrong-way driver liquor. The key elements of an Ohio dram shop violation are that the person was visibly intoxicated, yet the vendor continued to serve that person alcoholic drinks.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Was the driver distracted? </strong>Texting while driving, talking on a smartphone, eating, personal grooming, fatigue, or any other distraction could have resulted in the driver ending up on the wrong side of the roadway.</li>
    <li><strong>Was the driver negligent?</strong> Since there is no right reason for going the wrong way down an interstate, the driver is certainly liable for his own his careless and reckless conduct.</li>
</ul>
The truck driver who was injured and the trucking company whose truck and cargo went up in flames would have the right to bring a claim against the driver&#x2019;s estate. They would also have the right to assert a dram shop violation against a vendor who served a visibly intoxicated driver.

If you or a loved one was injured in any type of collision with a truck, the lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help. Our Ohio truck accident lawyers understand why such accidents happen, how to prove fault, and how to determine liability for any type of accident.

Ruling that the limit on non-economic damages violated the equal protection provisions of the state constitution, the Florida high court voted 4-3 to overturn the 2003 law which was passed to curb an alleged &quot;medical malpractice crisis,&quot; although the crisis never occurred.

The so-called medical malpractice crisis was nothing but a fabrication on the part of doctors and hospitals who live in fear of being sued, according to a story in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/12/30/top-republicans-say-theres-a-medical-malpractice-crisis-experts-say-there-isnt/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>. The <em>Post</em> story reports that &quot;Doctors are paying less for malpractice insurance than they did in 2001,&quot; and that the &quot;rate of claims has dropped by half since 2003.&quot;

Florida has made a smart move in abolishing non-economic damages caps, but now federal law would limit non-economic damages.
<h2>HR 1215 is dangerous to victims</h2>
HR 1215, <em>The Protection of Access to Care Act of 2017</em>, says that its purpose is to &quot;improve patient access to health care services and provide improved medical care by reducing the excessive burden the liability system places on the health care delivery system.&#x201D; But what it really does is take away your rights to a jury trial, and it would limit the amount of compensation an injured person can collect in a medical malpractice lawsuit to $250,000 regardless of the extent of the injury. Here is a link to the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1215/text" target="_blank">full text of HR 1215</a> and a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1215/summary" target="_blank">summary</a> of the proposed bill.

Given that preventable medical mistakes are now the third leading cause of death in the U.S., laws like this one would destroy any incentive for the health care industry to improve quality and safety for patients.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6081" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Doctor-talking-to-patient-300x226.jpg" alt="New Report on Women and Dangerous Medical Devices" width="300" height="226">The American Association for Justice has released a new report detailing the history of women being negatively impacted by dangerous drugs and medical devices. The report, entitled From Accutane to Zonite: A History of Dangerous Drugs &amp; Devices Marketed to Women<em>, </em>showcases how women have, historically, been disproportionately affected by dangerous drugs and medical devices. Many drugs and medical products are marketed specifically to women, such as certain acne drugs or antidepressants. Others are specifically created and marketed to contend with female-only medical issues, like pregnancy.

The report also details how the civil justice system is often the ultimate fail safe for dangerous drugs and medical devices. Safety checks, such as approval processes at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are, unfortunately, not always as discerning as they could be, especially with drugs and products designed or marketed to female populations.
<h2>Civil litigation can save women&#x2019;s lives</h2>
Dangerous medical products, such as transvaginal mesh or power morcellators, have long plagued women&apos;s healthcare options. When the FDA expedites approval, there are often quality control issues and harmful or deadly health risks that are simply overlooked due to lack of proper oversight from governmental agencies and pharmaceutical corporations. This timely American Association of Justice (AAJ) report highlights decades upon decades of gender inequalities in prescribing and providing safe medical care. Because of the legal recourse afforded to them by civil litigation, women have been empowered to fight back against substandard medical products, care, and drugs. The report spans from the 1880s to the present.

Julie Braman Kane, who serves as President of AAJ, weighs in. &#x201C;This timely report sheds light on the disturbing ways women have been preyed upon by corporations in the name of profit,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;More than a century of gender inequality in research and unhindered corporate greed continue to put women at risk of exposure to dangerous drugs and medical devices. We must protect women&#x2019;s access to justice to ensure they can end their silent suffering and hold corporations accountable when corporations refuse to put Americans&#x2019; safety first.&#x201D;

The House of Representatives is currently entertaining a bill, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1215" target="_blank">H.R. 1215</a>, that would give blanket immunity to corporations who market and sell these dangerous drugs and devices if they were at any point approved by the FDA. Even if they were later determined to be dangerous, the blanket immunity would still stand. This report goes a long way in showcasing why this pending legislation is deleterious to American citizens.

If you or someone you love has suffered because of a dangerous medical product or drug, the experienced Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice attorneys of Crandall &amp; Pera Law are here to help you. We can discuss your case with you and fight for maximum compensation.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6038" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Football-and-CTE-300x161.jpg" alt="football and cte" width="300" height="161">School&#x2019;s finally let out, and summer vacation is in full swing here in Ohio. That means pool parties, barbeques, amusement parks and summer concerts are all back. But before you know it, you&#x2019;ll see the flyer, or get an email or a text, about tryouts for the upcoming season for football. It might be the first year for your child, or maybe he (or she) has been playing for years.

Consider this our formal plea: please don&#x2019;t let your kids play football this year.

We know you&#x2019;ve heard the statistics. We know you&#x2019;ve read the literature, or maybe seen the movie <em>Concussion</em>. We know you&#x2019;ve attended the meetings with coaches who outline in great, possibly almost repetitive, detail the different programs that are in place to protect your child&#x2019;s precious and still-forming brain. We know that you&#x2019;ve raised concerns about this game that, perhaps, you yourself played for years, and that you&#x2019;ve done the research and spoken with your child&#x2019;s pediatrician. Your child is careful, and his (or her) coaches are concerned, and the school has invested in protective gear.

We know that brain injuries happen to <em>other people&#x2019;s children</em>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/sports/football/haunted-by-a-players-death-a-coach-walks-away-from-his-sport.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Until they don&#x2019;t</a>.
<h2>We need to talk about the true risk</h2>
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive, degenerative brain disease that disproportionately affects people who play contact sports and activities &#x2013; like football, boxing, soccer, MMA, etc. &#x2013; as well as anyone else with a history of repetitive brain trauma. It can begin after one hit. It can take years to develop. It might never develop at all.

And it&#x2019;s that last option &#x2013; that it might never actually happen &#x2013; that allows many people to assume that it will be okay. Even though the number of players who test positive for the disease falls between 87% (<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/new-87-deceased-nfl-players-test-positive-for-brain-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per PBS</a>) and 95.6% (per <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/study-956-percent-of-deceased-nfl-players-tested-positive-for-cte/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS Sports</a>), <em>it&#x2019;s not 100%</em>. So there&#x2019;s a <em>chance</em> that it won&#x2019;t be your child. There&#x2019;s a <em>chance</em> that he (or she) will be perfectly fine.

There are people who cancel backyard parties because there&#x2019;s a 50% chance of rain. Yet, the chance of your child not developing CTE after years of playing football falls <strong>between 4.4% and 13%</strong>. These numbers are based off of years of methodical research by doctors and scientists: men and women who have devoted their lives to working with the brain. These are about the same odds you have of beating <a href="http://www.cancercenter.com/lung-cancer/stages/tab/non-small-cell-lung-cancer-stage-IV/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stage IV lung cancer</a> (10%), and worse than the odds of surviving <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/breast-cancer-survival-rates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stage IV breast cancer</a> (22%), at least five years after being diagnosed.

</ul>
<h2>Living with permanent brain damage</h2>
When it comes to catastrophic injuries, we know what kinds of challenges victims face; we&#x2019;ve been fighting on behalf of those victims for years. And as former malpractice defense attorneys, we know what kind of fight the insurance company will put up when it comes to getting the care you need.

A traumatic brain injury can affect a victim for the rest of his or her life. CTE is caused by repetitive brain injuries, and it&#x2019;s permanent: once your child is diagnosed, he or she will have that condition forever, and it will progressively get worse. The symptoms and effects, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-traumatic-encephalopathy/basics/symptoms/con-20113581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as per the Mayo Clinic</a>, may include:
<ul>
    <li>Difficulty thinking (cognitive impairment)</li>
    <li>Impulsive behavior</li>
    <li>Depression or apathy</li>
    <li>Difficulties with speech</li>
    <li>Short-term memory loss, and eventual dementia</li>
    <li>Difficulty planning and carrying out tasks (executive function)</li>
    <li>Emotional instability, including irritability and aggression</li>
    <li>Motor impairment (tremors, mobility, muscle weakness, etc.)</li>
    <li>Inclination toward substance abuse</li>
    <li>Suicidal thoughts or behavior</li>
</ul>
People with CTE in its advanced stages may engage in behaviors that lead to their own deaths, either willingly or unknowingly. And there is only a 4.4-13% chance that it <em>won&#x2019;t</em> happen if your child continues to play football each year.

So this year, as every year, we ask you: Please. Don&#x2019;t let your kids play football this year. The decision could very well save their lives.

Birth can be a complex process, and when medical interventions are necessary, risks arise.

Although many birth injuries do not have permanent effects, some do require follow-up care, or even cause costly, debilitating lifelong complications. Because of the nature of birth injuries, subsequent medical care can often be financially devastating to families.
<h2><strong><em>Unlike birth or genetic defects, birth injuries are often preventable and occur during any phase of the delivery process</em></strong></h2>
Today, legal recourse is available to make sure those medical professionals who are at fault in birth injuries pay for necessary care. What are the most potentially serious birth injuries?
<ul>
    <li><strong>Brachial plexus injury</strong>: This nerve injury affects the arm and hand, often as a result of a difficult delivery or a collarbone fracture. These injuries range in severity, with some resolving entirely and others remaining permanently. For those with lifelong complications, the nerve pain and paralysis can impede education and inhibit employment options.</li>
    <li><strong>Bone fractures</strong>: Any number of bones can be injured prior to or during delivery; however, the majority of these fractures heal quickly and without serious intervention. In some cases though, such as fractures of the spinal column as a result of forceps misuse, the resulting paralysis or neurological issues can be irreversible.</li>
    <li><strong>Cerebral palsy</strong>: This incurable injury can actually result from a range of birth injuries, some genetic, others environmental, and still other from preventable asphyxia, infections, or traumatic handling during delivery. Degrees of deficiencies vary, but cerebral palsy generally results in muscular issues: lack of tone and control, problems with coordination and balance, postural issues, and difficulties with reflexes. Cerebral Palsy rarely affects intelligence, but speech and communication may be impaired or severely hindered.</li>
    <li><strong>Intracranial or subarachnoid hemorrhage</strong>: These are both varieties of bleeding within the skull and brain as a result of head injury or trauma during the birth process. The symptoms of these hemorrhages are formidable, including seizures, coma, and even death.</li>
    <li><strong>Meconium aspiration syndrome</strong>: Meconium is the infant&#x2019;s first stool. In some difficult deliveries, meconium is released into the amniotic fluid prior to or during birth. If the meconium gets into the infant&#x2019;s lungs, it can lead to pneumonia and pulmonary hypertension through the child&#x2019;s first decade of life.</li>
    <li><strong>Perinatal asphyxia</strong>: As with any asphyxia, this disorder occurs when the infant, does not receive sufficient oxygen. Depending on the duration of the deprivation, the results can range from minimal to grave, including seizures, shock, coma, or ineliminable neurological damage.</li>
</ul>
While the majority of hospital births in the US occur without any significant complications, about <a href="http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/b/birth_injury/stats.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 in every 1000</a> births do lead to injuries. In some of these situations, the medical professionals involved are accountable for the damages and ongoing medical care these infants require.

If your infant has suffered one of the aforementioned injuries during delivery, contact the experienced Kentucky and Ohio medical negligence lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law. We will meet with you to discuss your individual situation and help to get you the compensation you deserve.

BODY:
Sepsis is a systemic infection that kills one-quarter of the patients who contract it, but hospitals are taking a new approach to preventing and managing the illness. Even the most slight of injuries can expose patients to danger. Sepsis can follow even a minor infection, but can lead to grave consequences. Medical professionals in New York state are tackling the problem with the least likely resource&#x2014;red tape. Application of a detailed checklist can help prevent sepsis, diagnose it early, and make sure best practices are followed for treatment&#x2014;all of which lead to better outcomes for patients. When hospitals do not adhere to these protocols, patients can die, and doctors can be held legally responsible.
<h2><em>What is sepsis?</em></h2>
The human body has a few methods of handling infection: fever, white blood cells, and antibodies. In healthy people with minor cases, the person may not even realize he or she has an infection, because the immune system handles the problem swiftly and efficiently. In more serious cases, the signs of an infection like a high or prolonged fever, swelling, redness, malaise, and pain lead sufferers to seek medical treatment. In some cases, the immune response goes awry, leading the body&#x2019;s defenses to attack healthy tissue&#x2014;the beginning of sepsis. Without intervention, sepsis progresses to abnormal temperature (high or low), high heart rate, high respiratory rate, decrease in urine output (as the kidneys become unable to cope with the influx of material), altered mental status, changes in cardiac rhythm, pain, and low blood pressure. Not every patient with sepsis will experience every symptom, and many of the symptoms experienced can be confused with symptoms of other infectious processes. This means that sepsis can be missed, particularly in patients who have co-occurring or acute health issues.
<h2><em>Utilization of a checklist</em></h2>
In the New York case of Rory Staunton, age 12, a fall at school and subsequent infection led to a tragic outcome after sepsis set in. Staunton&#x2019;s family came together with medical professionals and lawmakers to create &#x201C;Rory&#x2019;s Regulations,&#x201D; which require hospitals to work through a series of checklists when presented with a patient suspected of suffering from sepsis. Because delays in treatment result in increased mortality, the checklist&#x2019;s ability to facilitate and speed the ministration process at other hospitals in the US has already resulted in an estimated 22% reduction in post-surgical deaths.

No checklist, however, can take the place of involved and informed doctors, nurses, and aides working directly with patients, observing their vital signs and symptoms, making educated diagnoses, and prescribing proven treatments. When sepsis is missed, or treatment is unnecessarily delayed, the results for patients can be fatal, and families can be left bereft and baffled by the loss of their loved one. In these times, legal counsel can provide guidance, assurance, and assistance in making sure that hospitals are held accountable.

If you or a family member has been injured or died after contracting sepsis and not receiving timely or adequate treatment, please contact the experienced Kentucky and Ohio medical negligence lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law. We will meet with you to discuss your family&#x2019;s individual situation and help to get you the justice and compensation you deserve.

But barring genetic ailments, there are still dangers to the unborn child that can come at the misconduct or misinformation distributed by a medical professional. In these cases, the impacts can range from merely scary but short-term, to serious and potentially life threatening to both child and mother. In these cases, the hospital, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, midwives, and other birthing professionals are legally responsible for the harm they have caused.
<h2><strong><em>What are some prenatal birth injuries?</em></strong></h2>
There are two main categories of prenatal birth injuries: the first involves the pregnant woman taking or being exposed to a medication or communicable disease, without clear notification of the potential dangers to the unborn child. The second type of prenatal birth injury involves situations where medical professionals fail in their due diligence in caring for a pregnant woman, with injurious consequences to the woman or unborn child.

For example, if a drug company fails to adequately test a medication for safety, and then allows it to be prescribed to pregnant women, leading to adverse effects, not only would the prescriber be at fault, so would they pharmacy that failed to check for interactions and the pharmaceutical company. Even typically innocuous substances can be hazardous to the developing child: take folic acid, for instance. Pregnant women are advised to consume adequate levels of folic acid before and during pregnancy to prevent spina bifida. However, in excessive amounts, folic acid itself causes birth defects. A medical professional who failed to advise a patient of the proper dosing of folic acid would be at fault for any resulting birth injuries.

Another concern that many pregnant women and their partners are made aware of it the risk of preeclampsia, a condition involving high blood pressure that can lead to seizures and death for both mother and infant. There are few treatments once preeclampsia has developed, so the primary goal is to closely monitor pregnant women for any risk factors or changes in their baseline medical statistics. Should a doctor fail to notice, or worse, ignore the incipient signs of preeclampsia, the doctor and the hospital that employs him or her could be held responsible for any subsequent birth injuries. Common prenatal negligence include:
<ul>
    <li>Exposure to toxins</li>
    <li>Failure to disclose genetic testing outcomes</li>
    <li>Inappropriate medical tests or care</li>
    <li>Failure to treat gestational diabetes</li>
    <li>Failure to diagnose rubella (German measles)</li>
    <li>Failure to diagnose or treat group B strep</li>
</ul>
The statute of limitations on birth injuries in Kentucky and Ohio is only one year, thus it is vital to seek legal counsel if your infant was injured through the neglect or misconduct of a medical professional prior to, during, or after birth.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6070" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/anesthesia-errors-300x200.jpg" alt="anesthesia errors" width="300" height="200">A lot of patients worry about anesthesia. Perhaps it&#x2019;s discomfort with the notion of being brought to an unconscious state where they cannot feel pain, and then returned to awareness with no memory of the intervening events. While anesthesia, when properly administered, has become safer in recent decades, errors persist, leading to grim outcomes for patients. In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26492481" target="_blank">2013</a>, the death rate in the US from anesthesia errors was three per 10,000 surgeries.
<h2><em>Causes and types of anesthesia errors</em></h2>
Trying to assign causation to accidents can be challenging, but in a medical setting the amount of assiduous record-keeping that accompanies even the most minor procedure can be extremely helpful to researchers and analysts. In the case of anesthesia errors, most issues fell into one or more of three categories: lack of monitoring, failure to follow proper procedures, and problems with equipment.&#xA0; As we look at the most common types of anesthesia errors, it becomes clear which cause or causes are the most likely to have been at play:
<ul>
    <li>Failing to emphasize the importance of preoperative protocols</li>
    <li>Failing to properly monitor patients before, during, and post anesthesia</li>
    <li>Failing to fully read the patient&#x2019;s medical history or interactions with the patient&#x2019;s medications</li>
    <li>Allergic reactions</li>
    <li>Utilizing defective equipment</li>
    <li>Incorrectly intubating the patient</li>
    <li>Administering excessive amounts of anesthesia for the particular procedure or patient&#x2019;s needs</li>
    <li>Administering insufficient amounts of anesthesia for the particular procedure or patient&#x2019;s needs</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Effects of anesthesia errors</em></h2>
Not every anesthesia error leads to permanent issues for the patient. Some can be minor, annoying, or even dismissed entirely. However, as the effects of anesthesia are cumulative over a lifetime, any over dosage or misuse can lead to problems in the future if the patient needs to go under anesthesia again. Particularly for patients who are already seriously ill, the repercussions of anesthesia errors can become acute. Patients <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26492481" target="_blank">under a year of age or older than 65</a> are at the greatest risk of serious complications or death. Other not insubstantial risks include:
<ul>
    <li>Damage to the circulatory system</li>
    <li>Damage to the nervous system</li>
    <li>Cardiovascular collapse</li>
    <li>Cardiac rhythm issues</li>
    <li>Asphyxia (lack of oxygen)</li>
    <li>Brain damage</li>
    <li>Spinal cord injuries, including possible paralysis</li>
    <li>Malignant hyperthermia</li>
    <li>Seizures</li>
    <li>Stroke</li>
    <li>Coma</li>
    <li>Death</li>
</ul>
The most <a href="http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1933404" target="_blank">common</a> severe complications involve respiratory issues leading to asphyxia, brain damage, or death.

While anesthesia is safer than ever, there are still risks, particularly in the very young, the very old, or those with compromised health situations. If you or a loved one has been injured through an anesthesia error, please contact the experienced Kentucky and Ohio medical negligence lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law, who will meet with you to discuss your individual situation and help to get you the justice, treatment, and compensation you deserve.

Forty-three percent of the children who died in traffic crashes were unrestrained, 15% were sitting in the front seat, and 9% were riding in a vehicle with a driver who was under the influence of alcohol: so says a study conducted by researchers from Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital in Boston and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and published in the Journal of Pediatrics. The study&apos;s primary data source was the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).

There was a wide range of variability regarding the percentage of children involved in fatal crashes throughout the states. The study reports that the percentage of unrestrained or inappropriately restrained children varied from 2% in New Hampshire to 38% in Mississippi. In Kentucky, 16% of the child fatalities there was no restraint or inappropriate restraint use, 77% of deaths occurred in accidents on rural roadways and 12% the speed limit was between 65-50 mph.

In Ohio, 14% of the children who died in traffic crashes in the study were unrestrained or improperly restrained, 34% of the fatal crashes occurred on state highways and 9% of the vehicles were traveling between 65-80 mph.

<a href="http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/child-safety/fatalityfacts/child-safety" target="_blank">The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a> (IIHS) reports that all 50 states and the District of Columbia have child restraint laws, but despite more children being restrained, many still ride unrestrained. One of the goals of the study was to provide lawmakers with data to help improve safety regulations that effect children&apos;s safety.&#xA0; The over-arching message that the study shows with glaring clarity is that parents must be far more vigilant about making sure that their children are properly restrained when they are passengers in a motor vehicle. As the study reveals, an improperly restrained child is no safer than an unrestrained child when it comes to a fatal car crash.

According to the study, a mere 10% improvement in the use of appropriate child restraint in cars would decrease the national child fatality rate significantly, reducing it from 0.94 per 100,000 to 0.56 per 100,000. Study authors also hope that the results of their research will have some impact on the federal level regarding child safety regulations.

What can you do as a parent? Make sure that your children are properly restrained every time they get into the car. If you are not sure is your child&#x2019;s safety seat is installed properly, the <a href="https://www.safercar.gov/cpsApp/cps/index.htm" target="_blank">NHTSA</a> has a national child safety seat inspection station locater database on its website. Just enter your state or zip code and you can find a location near you.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6054" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Distracted-Driving-300x200.jpg" alt="&#x201C;Internet of Things&#x201D; Raises Questions about Liability" width="300" height="200">How many times do you utilize the Internet each day? To answer that question, you might be thinking about each time you log on to complete your work, order a pizza, or check out your favorite social media site. But, you probably utilize the Internet far more often than you realize. Your home&#x2019;s security system, your GPS system, and even your fitness monitor use the Internet to provide the services you want and need. It is called the Internet of Things (IoT), and this state of the art technology is turning up in every corner of our lives.

As with all forward movement, these technical advances bring up questions about legal issues and liability for injuries related to these products. The tech website <a href="https://iot-for-all.com/iot-raises-new-challenges-assigning-liability/" target="_blank">IoTForAll.com </a>offers an example of this type of injury:

An individual is driving down the road in the rain, relying on a phone GPS app and electronic road signs to provide information about roadway conditions. The devices communicate that the street temperature is above freezing, even though the surface is frozen. The vehicle tires begin to spin out and the car veers off into a ditch, causing substantial injuries to the driver and the passenger. When the driver talks to an attorney, the question arises&#x2014;who should be held accountable?
<h2>Identifying liability for IoT injuries</h2>
Determining liability in an IoT case is a challenging task. In the scenario above, there may be numerous liable parties, including:
<ul>
    <li><strong>The creator of the driving app.</strong> If the driving app malfunctioned and provided incorrect information that the driver relied upon to his detriment, the company that created the app may be liable.</li>
    <li><strong>The company that manufactures and operates the sensors.</strong> If the signs and GPS app worked correctly but transmitted inaccurate information based on the malfunction of the sensors, the manufacturers and operators of the sensors may hold some responsibility for the injuries.</li>
    <li><strong>The road sign operator.&#xA0; </strong>Perhaps the road sign operator read the sensors incorrectly and programmed incorrect information into the signs. He and the company he works for may be liable.</li>
    <li><strong>The third-party that provided the software. </strong>Each of these devices likely relies on some type of software that is provided to them by a third-party company. If the software caused incorrect information to be communicated, the third-party company may be deemed responsible.</li>
</ul>
Each of these theories of liability could be plausible under this scenario, yet they do not include all of the possibilities. Even the telecom company that transmitted the data to your phone may have some liability for your injuries in a car crash.

Unfortunately, there are no concrete answers to these questions. Traditionally, product liability cases rely on the establishment of a relationship between an event and a resulting injury. IoT cases raise questions about causation and how transmission of information fits into the equation. There are even questions about whether IoT apps and software actually fall under the classification of products. Time will likely provide answers to these questions, as the courts take on an increasing number of IoT related matters.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6058" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/truck-accidents-300x206.jpg" alt="truck accidents" width="300" height="206">Large, commercial trucks are built to haul massive loads on busy highways. An important part of a truck driver&apos;s job is to make sure that the truck he or she is driving has a load that is the correct weight and properly secured before they hit the road. Truck crashes caused by unsecured cargo can be deadly for the truck driver and the other motorists with whom they share the road. <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/cargo-securement/cargo-securement-rules" target="_blank">The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMCSA), is the federal agency that is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation that governs commercial vehicle safety. The FMCSA has Cargo Securement Rules. The purpose of the cargo securement rules is to reduce the number of traffic crashes caused by cargo shifting within or falling from commercial vehicles.

If a truck driver is responsible for causing an accident caused by improperly loaded cargo, unsecured cargo, or an overloaded truck, the driver and their employer may be liable for the injuries and property damage.
<h2>Unsecured cargo can create road debris</h2>
One of the hazards created by unsecured cargo is road debris. If you are driving a passenger vehicle and you end up in a collision with road debris that fell from a truck, you may be able to take legal action and recover compensation from the truck driver, the owner of the truck or trucking company, the shipper and any other responsible party.

A study released last summer by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety reported that more than 200,000 crashes involved road debris on U.S. roadways in the past four years. Road debris caused approximately 39,000 injuries and more than 500 deaths between 2011 and 2014. Jurek Grabowski, research director for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety said of the study, &#x201C;This new report shows that road debris can be extremely dangerous but these crashes are preventable.&#xA0; Drivers can easily save lives and prevent injuries by securing their loads and taking other simple precautions to prevent items from falling off the vehicle.&#x201D;

Cargo that is not properly loaded or secured can easily shift in transit, which can make the truck become unbalanced leading to a greater tip over hazard or danger of jack knife.

Anyone who has suffered a serious injury from an accident with a tractor trailer with an unsecured load or improperly loaded cargo may benefit from having a conversation with an experienced Kentucky truck accident attorney who can offer legal guidance about the merits of your case.

Truck crashes can be complicated to investigate, but when you have been injured in a truck accident you need an experienced Kentucky truck accident attorney to find out who is at fault and who can be held liable for your injuries. The lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law are here to help you recover the compensation you need to get back to your life after your accident.

When the pain grew worse, Schneider went to Griffin Hospital, where she was also sent home because the doctors there <em>also</em> failed to diagnose the blood clot. Her condition deteriorated quickly and she was rushed to the hospital, where doctors concluded that nothing could be done to save the leg, so it had to be amputated.

Ms. Schneider filed a lawsuit against Dr. Huribal and the Southern Connecticut Vascular Center for medical negligence. A CT Superior Court jury awarded her $25 million. Schneider had already settled with Griffin hospital for an undisclosed amount according to a story in the <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Trumbull-doctor-ordered-to-pay-25-million-for-9972397.php" target="_blank"><em>CT Post</em></a>.
<h2>Diagnostic errors and medical malpractice</h2>
While there have been efforts within the health care community to improve patient safety, diagnostic errors have not received the same amount of attention and focus despite how common they are. A Harvard Medical Practice Study reported that diagnostic error accounted for 17% of preventable medical errors, and a systematic review of autopsies covering four decades reveals that about 9% of patients had experienced a major diagnostic error that went undetected while the patient was alive. (<a href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primers/primer/12/diagnostic-errors" target="_blank">Patient Safety Network</a> of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ).
<h2>Proving medical malpractice</h2>
In Ms. Schneider&#x2019;s case, the diagnostic error was clear. Two physicians who examined her missed the blood clot resulting in the amputation of her leg, but it was not difficult to draw a line of causation between the doctor&#x2019;s failure to diagnose the blood clot and the injury. That is not always the case for others.

To prove medical negligence, the plaintiff must have evidence that proves first that a doctor-patient relationship existed, and that the doctor&#x2019;s actions or failure to act was a breach of the accepted standard of care for that specialty. The plaintiff must then be able to show how the breach caused the injury, and the damages resulting from the injury. A medical expert investigates the incident and provides testimony on how the doctor&#x2019;s actions were negligent.

Ms. Schneider would probably be happy to give back the millions of dollars she will receive because of her doctor&#x2019;s negligence to have her own leg back. Taking legal action against those who caused your injury hopefully inspires a change that ensures that the same mistake is never repeated.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6049" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Lawsuit-300x200.jpg" alt="lawsuit" width="300" height="200">At the end of June 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed HR 1215, the Bill which limits your right to a fair trial by a jury of your peers, and limits the amount of recovery a medical malpractice victim may be awarded. Now, that Bill will move onto the Senate, which will likely vote on it after the recess.

The federal government got this wrong &#x2013; very wrong. Instead of looking to protect victims, they instead voted to enact a law based off of the myth that tort reform is good for the American people. It&#x2019;s not. It never will be. All tort reform does is harm innocent victims even more.

The Bill passed only a couple of weeks after Florida ruled that damage caps were unconstitutional &#x2013; a decision that rallied us. And though the passing of HR 1215 is a blow, we are cautiously optimistic about the fate of tort reform, because a Wisconsin appellate court has just ruled that the state&#x2019;s damage caps are unconstitutional, too.
<h2>A horrific case of medical negligence</h2>
The case involved one of the most egregious acts of medical negligence we have ever heard of. In 2011, a mother of four developed a Strep A infection. The strep was undiagnosed by doctors, and eventually led to septic shock. As a result, all four of the woman&#x2019;s limbs were amputated. A Wisconsin jury awarded her $25.3 million dollars &#x2013; $8.8 million which went to economic damages, like lost wages and medical expenses. Wisconsin, however, caps all non-economic damages at $750,000, and the decision ended up being appealed.

The <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/2017/07/05/wisconsins-cap-medical-malpractice-awards-unconstitutional-courts-rules/451418001/" target="_blank">Journal-Sentinel reports</a> that Judge Joan Kessler wrote this in the unanimous opinion:

&quot;We conclude that the statutory cap on non-economic damages is unconstitutional on its face.... Wisconsin&apos;s cap on non-economic medical malpractice damages <em>always</em> reduces non-economic damages <em>only</em> for the class of the most severely injured victims who have been awarded damages exceeding the cap, yet always allows full damages to the less severely injured malpractice victims.&quot;

Wisconsin&#x2019;s damage caps are 3x the amount that a person might be expected to receive under the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, and the appellate court still knew that limiting this patient&#x2019;s damages to $750,000 was the wrong idea. There is every reason to believe the case will go to the state&#x2019;s Supreme Court. We can only hope that they, too, will side with the patient.

What this woman and her family has suffered is unconscionable, but under HR 1215, this type of medical malpractice will be treated just the same as any other. If that meant that doctors and healthcare professionals would finally be held accountable for their actions, we could at least understand <em>why</em> someone might believe in the myth of tort reform.

But that won&#x2019;t happen. Instead, families will continue to be hurt under an unjust law based on a lie. That is we why urge you to <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/" target="_blank">contact your Senators</a> and ask them not to pass this dangerous Bill into law.

Like more than a million others, he watched Animal Adventure Park&#x2019;s giraffe cam. He watched April give birth to her daughter, Tajiri &#x2013; so excited that the little calf was finally here. So, when the Make-A-Wish Foundation asked what he wanted to do, Alex chose to go to Harpursville, New York in order to meet April and her family.

It&#x2019;s a really heart-warming story, but a bittersweet one, too: after all, Make-A-Wish makes dreams come true for children with life-threatening illnesses, and that is what Alex has. During Alex&#x2019;s birth, there we complications stemming from oxygen deprivation. As a result, he suffers from epilepsy, visual impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the effects of a brain injury. He is completely nonverbal, communicating through head nods and by shaking his arm.

<a href="http://www.wday.com/news/4280014-ohio-boy-seizure-disorder-gets-wish-meet-april-giraffe-calf-she-birthed-live-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WDAY 6 reports</a> that &#x201C;Make-A-Wish Central New York gave Alex stuffed giraffes before his visit and [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][Alex&#x2019;s mother said they] &#x2018;treated him like a king.&#x2019;&#x201D;
<h2>Oxygen deprivation can lead to life-threatening injuries and conditions</h2>
All birth injuries are serious; newborns are incredibly vulnerable, and what might be a minor injury to a child could have life-long effects on a baby. Oxygen deprivation, either pre-term or during the labor process, affects up to 4 million babies each year. About a quarter of those children will die as a result. Others may develop conditions like <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/injuries/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy</a>, or HIE,&#xA0;which can lead to permanent brain damage. It may also lead to seizure disorders, developmental delays, cerebral palsy, or any number of life-threatening conditions.
<h2>Common causes of lack of oxygen during birth</h2>
So what leads to a baby being deprived of oxygen at birth? Some of the most common causes include:
<ul>
    <li>Undiagnosed preeclampsia</li>
    <li>Undiagnosed or untreated infections</li>
    <li>Physical trauma</li>
    <li>Shoulder dystocia</li>
    <li>Excessive use of labor drugs like Pitocin</li>
    <li>Placental abruption</li>
    <li>Prolapsed nuchal cords</li>
    <li>Delayed C-sections</li>
    <li>Failure to monitor the mother and child during pregnancy</li>
</ul>
Not all birth injuries are a result of medical negligence, but proper pre-partum and delivery care can reduce the chances of a child sustaining life-threatening oxygen deprivation. If you ever feel like your child is not responding or acting the way he or she normally does, trust your gut and seek medical attention as quickly as you can. It is better to be safe.

Much of the news lately has been focused on the dangers associated with opioid painkillers, and fentanyl in particular, but a recent piece in the <em>New York Times</em> looked at a study involving heartburn medication.

Specifically, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/well/live/heartburn-drugs-may-increase-risk-of-early-death.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fhealth&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">article summarized</a> a study which &#x201C;compared people who used P.P.I.s [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][proton pump inhibitors] with those who used H2 receptor antagonists&#x201D; for relief of heartburn and acid reflux. Based on the research, patients who take PPI-based medications, like Nexium, Prilosec and Prevacid, were at a greater risk of death than those who took H2 receptor drugs, like Zantac or Pepcid.
<h2>Understanding the study</h2>
Researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis looked at <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e015735" target="_blank">case histories</a> of almost 350,000 people listed in the VA healthcare system. Of those cases, 275,933 people used PPIs, and 73,355 used H2 blockers, all between 2006 and 2008. The team then looked at the number of deaths over the next few years (a median of 5.71, per the study), and discovered that PPI users had a 25% increased chance of dying over patients who used H2 blockers. The risk increased for users depending on how long they took the medication.
<h2>What is causing this increase?</h2>
The truth is, no one is quite sure. It could be the way a body metabolizes vitamins and minerals, or it could be related to the bacteria in our stomachs. As Dr. Folasade P. May explained to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/heartburn-drugs-proton-pump-inhibitors-ppi-risks-prilosec-nexium-prevacid/" target="_blank">CBS News</a>, &quot;If the group taking PPIs was dying more often, what were they dying of?... Are they dying of heart disease, losing weight, or dying from a mix of medical problems? The PPI group was older and sicker. I would argue if you follow an older, sicker population, then they&apos;re likely to have more deaths anyway.&#x201D;

The research team stressed that this correlation, <em>not</em> causation: in other words, they will not say that PPI drugs are the definitive reason behind people dying &#x2013; merely that users die more often than non-users.
<h2>Should I be worried about my heartburn medication?</h2>
Not necessarily. If you are prescribed a PPI medication for a serious condition, like a bleeding ulcer, then you should not stop taking the drugs without first consulting your doctor. If you are a regular user of OTC medications with PPIs, you should seek medical advice, anyway; your heartburn or reflux could indicate a more serious condition.

However, you should be aware that PPIs do have a list of potentially serious side effects associated with them. These risks include an increased chance of:
<ul>
    <li>Stroke</li>

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6042" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Event-loggers-300x169.jpg" alt="event data recorders and accidents" width="300" height="169">Let&#x2019;s say you are stopped at an intersection on a quiet back road. You take a glance to each side, and proceed to make a left-hand turn. The next thing you know, your airbag has deployed, your arms are scratched up and your car is sitting on the side of the road, facing the opposite direction. The cops ask you what happened, and you cannot remember &#x2013; but another person at the scene claims you made a left while he was going through the intersection, and that you caused the accident.

In a scenario like this, where perhaps the evidence cannot definitely point to which driver was liable for the crash, the insurance company, an accident reconstructionist or your injury attorney may ask to see the data from the Event Data Recorder, or EDR, in your vehicle. An EDR (also called a &#x201C;black box&#x201D;) is a piece of tech installed in many cars which is activated by your supplemental restraint controllers &#x2013; the controllers which activate your seatbelt or airbags. The EDR can record the engine speed, the vehicle speed, the position of the throttle, the seatbelt engagement switch: it all depends on the make and model of your car. Some vehicles save 5 seconds&#x2019; worth of data; others might store 25 seconds&#x2019; worth. This data can help us determine whether you cut off the other vehicle, or if the driver was speeding, and then attempted to hit the brakes to avoid a collision.

For commercial trucks, the tech is a bit different. Most semis don&#x2019;t come equipped with airbags, but because of the strict regulations on their emissions, &#x201C;all modern truck engines use an electronic engine control module (ECM) that monitors engine and vehicle operating parameters. The primary function of the ECM is to control the engine, but it can also serve the secondary function of recording engine and vehicle information.&#x201D;
<h2>Making a case for another driver&#x2019;s liability after a crash</h2>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has advocated the use of EDRs since 1997, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/event-data-recorder" target="_blank">claiming</a> &#x201C;EDRs could provide information that is very valuable to understanding crashes, and which can be used in a variety of ways to improve motor vehicle safety.&#x201D; And this is true &#x2013;but all technology is subject to glitches or malfunctions, and not all recorders will capture data in all circumstances.

Because of this, it is critical that an EDR not be the only piece of evidence your attorney uses. Eye witness accounts, the condition of the roads, videos or photos pulled form traffic cameras and medical reports are all important pieces of evidence, and your attorney will use all of them (when applicable) in conjunction with the EDR&#x2019;s information to build a case for another driver&#x2019;s liability.

Dealing with the after effects of a serious car crash can be challenging; finding the right injury lawyer to represent your needs shouldn&#x2019;t be.

The realization that you will soon be required to care for a tiny human is daunting, to say the least. A thousand questions follow, and though 9 months may seem like a long time, it goes by in a flash that ends with a million more questions. Throughout that time, first-time parents are bombarded with information from every side about prenatal care, the process of childbirth, and postnatal follow-up.
<h2>How important information gets lost</h2>
During the blitzkrieg of information that follows a positive pregnancy test, parents-to-be don&#x2019;t have the luxury of research time. Instead, they struggle to adapt to the idea that new routines and priorities have entered their lives. Mostly, it&#x2019;s a desperate, headlong rush to stay on top of mundane details while preparing for a whole new life.

From <a href="http://abc13.com/health/newborn-dies-after-developing-meningitis-from-herpes-virus/2230599/" target="_blank">ABC 13</a>:

&#x201C;Nicole and Shane Sifrit welcomed baby Mariana on July 1. A week later -- two hours after the couple&apos;s wedding -- they say they noticed that the girl was not eating and would not wake up when they tried to get her to respond. &#x2018;It&apos;s horrific,&#x2019; Nicole Sifrit said. &#x2018;She had quit breathing, and all her organs just started to fail.&#x2019; The couple left their wedding early to take Mariana to Blank Children&apos;s Hospital in Des Moines, where they learned that she had contracted meningitis HSV-1, caused by the herpes virus -- the same virus that causes cold sores.&#x201D;

Exactly how Mariana contracted HSV-1 will likely remain a mystery. Both of her parents tested negative for the virus, though Johns Hopkins Medicine suggests that the infection point could have been a well-wishing visitor. According to the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs400/en/" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>, approximately 67% of the global population carries the virus, which is mostly harmless in those with fully developed immune systems. Most people aren&#x2019;t even aware that they are carriers.

Unfortunately, newborns are highly susceptible to infection; they are born without a functioning immune system. Whatever protection they are afforded comes from their mother through placental transfer and breast milk; breastfed babies get sick far less often than their bottle-fed counterparts. However, no amount of passive immunity can prevent a point infection from developing into a full-blown illness. Babies simply lack the ability to fight systemic infections until they are around 5 months of age.
<h2>A failure to communicate</h2>
Healthcare professionals are aware of this fact and do their best to inform new parents of the risks of exposing their children to visitors and situations that can pose health risks. However, new parents are dealing with a million details when a baby arrives; despite these efforts, the messages don&#x2019;t always stick.

The Sifrit&#x2019;s have experienced an unbelievable tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with the young family. Despite her terrible loss, Nicole Sifrit hopes that other new parents can learn from her loss, imploring new parents to, &#x201C;Keep your babies isolated. Don&#x2019;t let just anyone visit them. Make sure they are constantly washing their hands. Don&#x2019;t let people kiss your baby. And make sure they ask before they pick up your baby.&#x201D;

All patients have rights, including newborns. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities work diligently to ensure a safe and protected environment for their patients, but sometimes, even the best efforts aren&#x2019;t enough to prevent a tragedy. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight for those who can&#x2019;t fight for themselves to help families recover after a medical mistake.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6038" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Football-and-CTE-300x161.jpg" alt="football and cte" width="300" height="161">Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a degenerative brain disease linked to contact sports and brain trauma. For several years, the focus has been on professional football players, with a back-and-forth, does-it-or-doesn&#x2019;t-it approach to whether or not playing in the NFL will increase a person&#x2019;s chance of developing the disease.

Researchers from the Boston University School of Medicine and the VA Boston Healthcare System have finally laid that question to rest. Their findings were published in the <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2645104" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>:</a> &#x201C;In a convenience sample of 202 deceased players of American football from a brain donation program, CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 players across all levels of play (87%), <strong>including 110 of 111 former National Football League players </strong>(99%)&#x201D; (emphasis ours).

In the interest of full transparency, researcher Dr. Ann McKee admits that there is &#x201C;selection bias&#x201D; in the samples used, because &#x201C;many families [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][of former NFL players] have donated brains specifically because the former player showed symptoms of C.T.E,&#x201D; per the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/sports/football/nfl-cte.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fhealth&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=health&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>New York Times</em></a>. Still, based on the number of players who have died since the BU researchers started studying CTE (1300), even if only these 110 players were diagnosed with the condition, &#x201C;the minimum C.T.E. prevalence would be close to 9 percent, vastly higher than in the general population.&#x201D;

    <li>CTE Research Is Incredible, but Prevention Is the Only Sure Cure</li>
</ul>
<h2>Looking at the numbers</h2>
There were 202 brains, and the median age* of the deceased player was about 66 years old. The average amount of years played was between 13 (for mild CTE) and 16 (for severe CTE).

What the study found was players who were diagnosed with mild CTW pathology were considerably younger (media age 44) than those diagnosed with severe CTE pathology (median age 71). Suicide was the leading cause of death for those with mild pathology; neurodegenerative conditions, like dementia and Parkinson&#x2019;s, was the leading cause of death for those with severe pathology.

The study also divided the groups into levels of play:
<ul>
    <li>111 played in the NFL / 110 diagnosed</li>
    <li>8 played in the Canadian Football League &#x2013; 7 diagnosed</li>
    <li>14 played semi-professionally / 9 diagnosed</li>
    <li>53 played in college / 48 diagnosed</li>
    <li>14 played in high school / 3 diagnosed</li>
    <li>2 played pre-high school / 0 diagnosed</li>
</ul>
The good news is that the numbers are significantly lower for players at the high school (and, obviously, pre-high school) level. The bad news is that the diagnoses <em>exists</em> for three players who only played up through high school. And while the sample size for those players is small, just over 20% of the donated brains of high-school players showed signs of CTE.

Twenty percent. A fifth of the brains. Just from playing in high school.

This latest study is important, but unsurprising; after all, we&#x2019;ve been making this case for the last two years. As injury attorneys, we see first-hand how a permanent brain injury can turn a family&#x2019;s world upside down. We know that CTE is progressive, which means it will get worse and worse for the victim. We know there is no cure: once you have the disease, it is with you until you die.

Choose the future. Choose your children. Choose life.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6036" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Roller-coaster-injuries-300x296.jpg" alt="Ohio State Fair Accident" width="300" height="296">The story of the Ohio State Fair&#x2019;s ride malfunction that left several injured and one man dead has made headlines across the country. The ride, called the Fire Ball, swings riders 40 feet in the air while spinning them at 13 revolutions per second. On July 27, the thrill ride ended in tragedy when an unknown malfunction caused sections of the ride to come apart and threw riders great distances at high speeds. The ride had been inspected only hours earlier, prompting the manufacturer to sent notices to operators to suspend use until further notice.
<h2>How many people are injured or killed each year by rides?</h2>
This disaster is not an isolated incident. From <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/number-accidents-due-amusement-park-rides-might-be-higher-you-n787286" target="_blank">NBC News</a>: &#x201C;The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated that 30,900 injuries caused by amusement park attractions were seen by hospital emergency departments in 2016 alone. Those injured are out of millions of people who visit carnivals, fairs and festivals each year, the Outdoor Amusement Business Association, which represents much of the mobile amusement industry, estimates. Since 2010, the CPSC reports that there have been 22 fatalities caused by thrill rides, including Wednesday&#x2019;s death in Ohio.&#x201D;

Just last year, three young girls fell nearly 40 feet when a Ferris wheel cabin tipped over at the Greene County Fair in Tennessee. Worn rivets on the ride failed and allowed a part of the ride to become lodged in the frame, a problem that earlier inspections failed to reveal. One of the girls, just 6 years old, suffered a traumatic brain injury and spent nearly two months on life support following the incident. Her family continues to suffer the consequences of her injuries.

While these are the most recent tragedies, they are by no means the only ones with fatal consequences:
<ul>
    <li>In July 2015, 18-year-old Gregory Horan died at Ijams Nature Park in Tennessee during a rope course adventure when he fell and his harness malfunctioned, asphyxiating him.</li>
    <li>In January 2015, a 15-year-old Boy Scout died after sustaining a head injury during a zip line ride in Arizona.</li>
    <li>In October 2013, five members of the same family were exiting a ride at the North Carolina State Fair when it began to move. One family member sustained brain and spinal cord injuries.</li>
    <li>In June of 2007, a then 13-year-old girl had her feet severed after a cable broke on the Superman Tower of Power ride, at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom. Doctors were only able to reattach one of her feet, leaving her permanently disabled.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When fun becomes dangerous</h2>
Amusement park rides are designed to thrill us by offering a taste of danger; adrenaline junkies seek the tallest coasters, the longest drops, and the tightest loops. Ride designers and manufacturers walk a tightrope between danger and safety; the biggest thrills also present the biggest risks. Inspection procedures are designed to prevent tragedy, and scheduled maintenance should replace parts before they are in danger of failing, not after. Despite these efforts, incidents like the Ohio State Fair tragedy still happen.

When multiple inspections and best practices aren&#x2019;t enough to prevent a tragedy, determining fault requires moving up the line. At some point from inception to design to engineering to manufacturing, a mistake caused an accident that ended a young man&#x2019;s life and left a family grieving an untimely loss.

The Kentucky and Ohio personal injury attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law fight for families who have been affected by an injury or death resulting from negligence. If your loved one was injured or killed because of someone else&#x2019;s negligence, you may be entitled to compensation for lost wages, medical bills or other expenses.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6029" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Truck-Drivers-300x199.jpg" alt="Older Truck Drivers Dangerous" width="300" height="199">In response to the shortage of truck drivers in the U.S., trucking companies have turned to recruiting retired men and women to fill those job. In a study conducted last year by <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trucking-semi-industry-recruiting-retirees-commercial-drivers-accidents/" target="_blank">CBS News</a>, between 2013 and 2015, there were more than 6,636 trucking accidents involving older drivers, and that there was a 19% increase in accidents involving both commercial truck drivers and bus drivers who were age 70 and older. As the trucking companies recruit these older drivers, might they be contributing to potentially higher numbers of traffic crashes on the highways?

The CBS article highlighted these stories of truck crashes caused by older truck drivers:
<ul>
    <li>A driver who was 76 years old who rolled over the top of three cars killing ten people in Oklahoma in 2009.</li>
    <li>In Newark, NJ, a bus was T-boned by another bus driven by a 70-year-old driver. Two people were killed in August 2016.</li>
    <li>A truck hauling stones driven by a 74-year-old driver slammed into traffic in a construction zone injuring ten people in Binghamton, New York in August 2016.</li>
</ul>
This is a sensitive issue in many ways because there are federal laws against age discrimination in employment. So, it would be illegal for trucking companies to place an arbitrary age limit on truck drivers. Also, given that everyone is different, not every driver over age 65 is going to automatically be an unsafe driver simply because they are over age 65. Given that as people age, reaction time and stamina can decrease, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration considered requiring skills test for older drivers of commercial vehicles, but those plans were scrapped because there was a shortage of drivers and because of age discrimination laws.

While it is not fair to say that just because a driver is older they are going to be a hazard behind the wheel, one of the challenges with older drivers is that they tend to have more disqualifying medical conditions. Another <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-medically-unfit-commercial-drivers-end-up-behind-the-wheel-greyhound-bus-crash/" target="_blank">CBS News</a> story revealed that commercial truck drivers can hide underlying medical conditions that could disqualify them from working. Often, with age comes an increase in those medically disqualifying medical conditions.

Right now, in the United States if you can pass the medical screening test, you can become a truck driver regardless of your age. The airline industry is also facing a shortage of pilots, but they require pilots to retire at age 65.

Any kind of age discrimination in employment is against the law, but if the <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/faq/what-medical-conditions-disqualify-commercial-bus-or-truck-driver" target="_blank">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMCSA) strengthened and enforced its regulations about training and health qualifications for all drivers on a regular basis, they would not be discriminating against older drivers. Ask the family members of those ten people who were killed on an Oklahoma highway on the way to a family celebration if it might be time to address the issue of making sure that every truck driver regardless of age is indeed in healthy enough condition to drive safely.

The lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law are here to help you recover the compensation you need to get back to your life after your injuries from a truck accident.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6031" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Brain-Injury-300x240.jpg" alt="catastrophic injury" width="300" height="240">Surviving an accident can leave you with anything from minor cuts and scrapes, to a catastrophic injury from which you never fully recover. Whether you were involved in a truck accident, you suffered devastating burns in a fire or explosion, or you suffered a head injury from a fall, catastrophic injuries are serious and require life-long medical care and often nursing care just to get through the day.
<h2>What are catastrophic injuries?</h2>
A catastrophic injury is a severe injury to the spine, spinal cord, or brain, and may also include skull or spinal fractures. This is a subset of the definition for the legal term catastrophic injury, which is based on the definition used by the <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Medical Association</a>.
<h2>What are some of the common causes of catastrophic injury?</h2>
There are countless possible causes of catastrophic injury. Here are a few examples:
<ul>
    <li>Car accidents</li>
    <li>Workplace accidents</li>
    <li>Truck accidents</li>
    <li>Bicycle accidents</li>
    <li>Falls from height</li>
    <li>Sport and recreational activities</li>
    <li>Construction accidents</li>
    <li>Medical mistakes</li>
    <li>Defective medical devices or drugs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples of catastrophic injuries</h2>
Here are some examples of different types of catastrophic injuries caused by the negligence, carelessness or recklessness of another individual:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Traumatic brain injury</strong> can result in life-long cognitive dysfunction, abnormal speech and language, emotional difficulties, and limited ability to move their arms and legs.</li>
    <li><strong>Spinal cord injury</strong> can result in partial or complete paralysis, respiratory and circulatory problems, exaggerated reflexes and spasms, chronic pain, loss of bowel and bladder control.</li>
    <li><strong>Severe burn injury</strong> can cause infections, limb loss, disfigurement, and permanent disability depending on the location and extent of the burns.</li>
    <li><strong>Limb loss</strong> in an accident can cause tremendous physical and emotional challenges for the amputee and his or her loved ones.</li>
    <li><strong>Ruptured kidneys, spleen, liver or bowels</strong> from a car crash or other accident can cause internal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lifelong costs associated with a catastrophic injury</h2>
If you sustain an injury which requires ongoing medical attention and long periods of hospitalization, you will be unable to work and in some cases unable to care for your own daily needs. The medical expenses, the cost of daily nursing care and other related expenses can ruin a person financially. Some of those costs include:
<ul>
    <li>Emergency medical expenses</li>
    <li>Continuing medical care</li>
    <li>Visiting nursing care</li>
    <li>Medications</li>
    <li>Physical and occupational therapy</li>
    <li>Counseling</li>
    <li>Medical equipment such as a hospital bed at home, wheel chairs, a lift</li>
    <li>Costs to retro-fit a home to accommodate a wheelchair</li>
    <li>Lost wages</li>
    <li>Diminished earning capacity</li>
    <li>Pain and suffering</li>
    <li>Emotional distress</li>
    <li>Disfigurement</li>
</ul>
One of the biggest challenges with a catastrophic injury is that the effects of the injury persist long after the accident. A person who suffered a spinal cord injury may develop respiratory problems long after the injury occurred, or a person who sustained a traumatic brain injury might seem perfectly normal in appearance, but faces challenges such as blinding headaches, memory loss, and cognitive difficulties which can make it virtually impossible for them to keep a job and to maintain personal relationships.

Sometimes people just assume that they will get enough compensation from the at fault party&apos;s insurance company, but that is rarely the case unless you are working with a skilled personal injury attorney who knows how to engage with the experts who can calculate the long-term costs of your medical care into the future. You might not have any way of knowing what is a fair amount of compensation for your injuries and the ongoing damage that they are wreaking on your life.

Keeping track of these numbers gives you an idea of how many crashes are still occurring and the amount of injuries and property damage these accidents cause. Unless you have been involved in a car accident and suffered serious injuries, you may not be able to grasp the magnitude of how it can devastate your life. Knowing how often crashes occur, how many people are injured and lose their lives may motivate drivers to step up their level of caution and safety when they are driving. To the extent that it is in your power to be a safer driver, doing so saves lives--even maybe your own.
<h2>Ohio traffic accident statistics for 2016</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There were 305,964 total traffic crashes</li>
    <li>Of those crashes, 1,054 were fatalities and 77,514 had injuries-- 9,207 of which were incapacitating, serious injuries</li>
    <li>Of the vehicles involved in those crashes, 503,890 were passenger vehicles, 4,342 were motorcycles and 23,474 were med/heavy trucks</li>
    <li>There were 12,243 alcohol-related crashes with 313 having fatalities and 5,076 involved injuries</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.publicsafety.ohio.gov/links/2016CrashFacts.pdf" target="_blank">(Ohio Department of Public Safety</a>)
<h2>What is causing these traffic crashes?</h2>
The roadways are an unsafe place because drivers tend to misjudge their ability to operate a motor vehicle while engaging in other activities that take their attention at the same time such as using their mobile phone or typing or reading text messages. Drivers don&apos;t realize that they have had too much to drink, so they get behind the wheel and cause a terrible crash. And many drivers do not understand how dangerous it is to drive when they are overly tired. Drowsy driving can be as dangerous as drunk driving.
<h2>Seeking compensation for injuries from traffic crashes</h2>
Whenever there is a car accident, there is the potential for serious injuries. Driver error is the leading cause of any kind of motor vehicle accident, and when that error arises out of negligence, the injured party may be able to take legal action against the driver who is at fault in causing the accident. If the injured party is successful in proving the other driver&apos;s negligence, they may recover compensation for their pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost income and other damages.

Suffering an injury in a serious car accident can be a devastating experience. You often lose time at work, have mounting medical bills and you may face years of pain and the inability to do those things you once enjoyed.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6026" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Nursing-home-abuse-200x300.jpg" alt="nursing home abuse" width="200" height="300">If you are watching for signs of abuse or neglect in an elder who lives in a nursing home, you&apos;re not necessarily looking for a black eye or a broken wrist. While some of the signs include unexplained bruises or broken bones there are other, more subtle signs that you should also be keeping an eye out for.

In case you might be thinking that nursing home abuse or neglect is rare, the <a href="https://www.ncoa.org/public-policy-action/elder-justice/elder-abuse-facts/" target="_blank">National Council on Aging</a> (NCOA) reports that about 1 in 10 Americans over age 60 have experienced some form of elder abuse, however because elder abuse is chronically under-reported, only about 1 in 14 incidents of abuse are reported to authorities.

The NCOA cites the following as warning signs of abuse of elders in general as bruises, pressure marks, broken bones, burns and abrasions, and signs of neglect can include bedsores, poor hygiene and unusual weight loss, but there are also other signs that you can look for in your relative or in the facility environment.

Because they receive federal funding from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), law mandates nursing homes must meet certain health, safety and staffing level regulations. When a nursing home is found to be in violation of these regulations, CMS can penalize them with fines and withholding a percentage of reimbursements until the deficiencies have been resolved.
<h2>Examples of warning signs of nursing home abuse or negligence</h2>
The following are some additional warning signs that your loved one might be in a situation where their care is being neglected, or they are being abused:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Noticeable physical changes,</strong> changes in mood and temperament. Have you seen significant weight loss, poor grooming and hygiene, dehydration and malnourishment, or other physical signa like bedsores, that your loved one is not being cared for properly?</li>
    <li><strong>Heavily medicated or sedated</strong>. When you come to visit does your loved one always seem to be heavily sedated and unresponsive? Do not be shy about asking why they are so heavily medicated and what other options might be available.</li>
    <li><strong>Inadequate staffing levels</strong> and high staff turnover. Adequate staffing levels are vital to maintaining a healthy, safe environment for residents. If it seems like staffing levels have dropped or if they seem inadequate, raise your concerns with the administrators.</li>
    <li><strong>Unsanitary conditions.</strong> There is never an excuse for a nursing facility to be unclean and unsanitary because this can lead to the spread of infections and disease.</li>
    <li><strong>Refusing care from specific staff members.</strong> If your loved one says that they do not want a specific staff member to attend to them, you should find out what happened if you can, report it to the administrators immediately, and then follow-up to find out what has been done to address your concerns.</li>
    <li><strong>Residents injuring other residents</strong>. When residents are not adequately supervised, some residents can injure other residents</li>
    <li><strong>Unsatisfactory response from staff.</strong> If you have been noticing some of the troubling signs listed above, and you have mentioned them to nursing home staff yet you have seen no evidence that the issues have been addressed, it might be time to report the facility to the state authorities.</li>
    <li><strong>Uneasy feeling about the facility</strong>. Trust your gut. If you get a bad feeling that something is not right, do not hesitate to ask questions and follow-up. Nursing homes operate in apart from public view, so much of what goes on there is never known until an outside visitor who sees something is willing to say something.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the benefits of working with a Kentucky nursing home negligence and abuse attorney?</h2>
Sure, you can file a complaint about the alleged incidents of neglect or abuse you saw regarding your loved one in a nursing home, but if you are looking to make sure that something like this does not happen to another resident, and it you want to recover the additional medical expenses and compensation for your loved one&#x2019;s pain and suffering and mental anguish, then you will want to work with a skilled attorney. Building a nursing home negligence case takes the skill and experience that our legal team possesses. We fight for your loved one&#x2019;s right to be cared for properly and to live in a safe, nurturing environment.

Before you have a chance to react, there is a 50,000-lb tractor trailer skidding in your direction. It is every driver&apos;s worst nightmare, and it happens far too often on the roadways of Kentucky.

Jackknifing occurs when a truck&apos;s trailer swings towards the cab, forming an L or V shape that is similar to a folding pocketknife. These incidents can be extremely dangerous for others driving on the roadway in the vicinity of the truck. The out of control trailer may push the cab, causing the truck to spin in a circle on the road. Cars in its path may be pushed into oncoming lanes of traffic, or crushed underneath the weight of the truck.
<h2><strong><em>What causes a truck to jackknife?</em></strong></h2>
Jackknifing truck accidents can happen for a number of reasons. Loss of traction is the mechanical reason these incidents occur, as the trailer&apos;s brakes fail to adequately slow or stop the wheels. The main vehicle may slow down, but the trailer continues moving at the same speed, causing it to slide toward the cab. Blown tires are a common cause of jackknifing. If a tire blows while the truck is traveling at high speeds, the vehicle could jackknife.

An experienced Kentucy truck accident lawyer knows that driver negligence is often part of the issue. Some examples of driver actions that lead to jackknifing include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reckless driving in dangerous road conditions.</strong> Drivers have a duty to operate their trucks in a cautious manner, particularly when the road is wet or icy. Braking issues commonly occur in poor weather conditions. If the driver is traveling too quickly on a slick roadway, the trailer may lose traction and jackknife.</li>
    <li><strong>Excessive speeds.</strong> Trucks need space and time to brake correctly. When operators travel at excessive speeds, they may not allow themselves enough time or distance to properly stop the truck. When a truck driver slams on brakes, it may cause the trailer brakes to lock and slide on the road, also resulting in a jackknife.</li>
</ul>
The attorneys of Crandall &amp; Pera Law are concerned about your well-being and your ability to afford the level of medical treatment needed after a serious crash.

Ball allegedly walked into two separate rooms at the <a href="http://www.wdrb.com/story/36198961/elizabethtown-man-accused-of-sexually-abusing-male-residents-of-assisted-living-facility#.WZ8EcXnx-dI.email" target="_blank">Bluegrass Assisted Living</a> facility in Elizabethtown and sexually assaulted two separate residents. Mr. Ball claims it was all a big misunderstanding; the Elizabethtown Police Department claims he confessed. The families are distraught, and Ball&#x2019;s employer, Tender Touch Senior Services, Inc. refused to comment.

What happened at Bluegrass Assisted Living is just another example of the systemic problem of abuse and neglect in our nursing homes. Earlier this year, CNN created an in-depth piece of investigatory journalism titled &#x201C;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/02/health/nursing-home-sex-abuse-investigation/" target="_blank">Sick, Dying and Raped in America&#x2019;s Nursing Homes</a>.&#x201D; It said:

&#x201C;More than 16,000 complaints of sexual abuse have been reported since 2000 in long-term care facilities (which include both nursing homes and assisted living facilities), according to federal data housed by the&#xA0;<a href="https://acl.gov/" target="_blank">Administration for Community Living</a>.&#xA0;But agency officials warned that this figure doesn&#x2019;t capture everything&#xA0;&#x2014; only those cases in which state long-term care ombudsmen (who act as advocates for facility residents) were somehow involved in resolving the complaints.&#x201D;

Over the course of three years (2013 through 2016), more than 1000 facilities faced federal citations &#x201C;for mishandling or failing to prevent alleged cases of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse,&#x201D; and many of them had more than one citation. Half of them didn&#x2019;t even get the police involved, or run proper background checks, or pursue any real investigation at all.

Kentucky is among the worst offenders in the country. In 2014, the <a href="http://kycir.org/2014/10/22/a-powerful-nursing-home-owner-and-a-push-for-medical-review-panels-in-kentucky/" target="_blank">Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting</a> found that &#x201C;As of Oct. 1, Kentucky had 284 nursing homes rated on the [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] database, and a third of those had scores of one or two stars.... Only eight states had a higher percentage of below-average homes.&#x201D; They also discovered &#x201C;The state had just racked up a record 190 cases of &#x2018;immediate jeopardy&#x2019; among nursing home patients, according to the Health and Family Services Cabinet, and had gotten a D on its Families for Better Care report card.&#x201D;
<h2>We need to do better for our families</h2>
As of this writing, there are 293 nursing homes in Kentucky. Our own Cabinet for Health and Family Services lists more than 100 assisted living facilities. While you can use the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/results.html#state=KY&amp;lat=0&amp;lng=0&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" target="_blank">Nursing Home Compare</a> site to see how well or how poorly your loved one&#x2019;s nursing home facility is, it does not provide rankings for assisted living facilities. The only research you can do easily involves online reviews &#x2013; and the reviews of Bluegrass Assisted Living are suspiciously high, given the number of complaints we have heard over the years. The same may be true of other assisted living facilities throughout the state.

It falls on all of us to protect our loved ones from harm. Here are a few signs to keep an eye open for:
<ul>
    <li>Unsanitary conditions</li>
    <li>Dangerous or &#x201C;cluttered&#x201D; walkways</li>
    <li>Broken or malfunctioning medical equipment</li>
    <li>Low staff numbers</li>
    <li>Residents refusing care from certain staff members</li>
    <li>Poor or inadequate security measures in place</li>
    <li>Uncertainty or generic answers from staff about how your loved one is doing</li>
    <li>Changes in the residents&#x2019; hygiene, appetites or personalities</li>
    <li>Heavily medicated, restrained or isolated residents</li>
    <li>Multiple people in the halls who you don&#x2019;t recognize, and who are not visiting a specific resident</li>
</ul>
Finally, trust your gut: if something seems wrong, it probably is. If you believe your family member has been abused, it is time to call an attorney who can help.

Not only are law enforcement officials overwhelmed with the effects of these self-destructive behaviors, but innocent citizens are being impacted as impaired drivers take to the roadways. This problem is so prevalent that vehicle crashes caused by driver overdoses are becoming a common occurrence.&#xA0; Further exacerbating the problem is the fact that many of these incidents involve truck drivers.

In 2016, Ohio law enforcement reported more than 4,500 drug-related crashes, according to <a href="http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/overdoses-on-the-road-drugged-driving-rises-as-a-menace-08-18-2017" target="_blank">ABC6 in Columbus</a>. This disturbing number represents a 21% increase in these crashes since 2013. As reported by the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/behavioral-research/drug-and-alcohol-crash-risk-study" target="_blank">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, fatalities in crashes where drugs were involved increased significantly from 2,003 in 1993 to 7,438 in 2015.
<h2>Recent truck overdosing accidents in the news</h2>
Tragically, the news has been filled with drug-related truck accidents in recent months. <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/green-township/police-revive-truck-driver-who-overdosed-on-i-74" target="_blank">WCPO Cincinnati </a>recently reported on a tractor trailer driver who reportedly overdosed while driving on Interstate 74. According to the report, the driver lost consciousness right before the truck jackknifed in the middle of the roadway. Other drivers pulled him from his cab and began performing CPR while waiting for emergency services. He was revived with Narcan, a substance used to revive people from opioid overdoses, and transported to the hospital. The driver was charged with operating a vehicle under the influence, failure to maintain control of his vehicle, and operation of a commercial motor vehicle while under the influence of a controlled substance.

In July, another truck driver overdose occurred in Cleves. The driver of a fuel truck was found passed out and bleeding from the nose in a gas station bathroom. His truck was reportedly running, which suggested that he was planning to operate it on the roadway. Heroin and pain pills were reportedly found inside of the truck.
<h2>Impaired truck operators place drivers and passengers at increased risk of harm</h2>
Experienced Ohio truck accident lawyers know that tractor trailers create a risk on the highways, even when the driver operates the vehicle in a safe and proper manner. When the operator is impaired and under the influence of drugs, the risk of serious harm and death increases significantly. An overdose can cause a driver to pass out or experience convulsions&#x2014;while driving a 60,000-lb vehicle at high speeds on a crowded roadway.

The attorneys of Crandall &amp; Pera Law understand the severity of injuries associated with truck driver overdoses, and the financial burdens that often accompany them.

As reported by the <a href="http://www.somerset-kentucky.com/news/lcrh-involved-in-kentucky-supreme-court-case/article_3a3a9c7e-8395-11e7-8b1e-b7efaec1bc82.html" target="_blank">Commonwealth Journal</a>, Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital (LCHR) is involved in a case before the Kentucky Supreme Court and the outcome could have far-reaching implications for hospitals and medical centers across the state.

The case stems from a back surgery performed at LCHR by a doctor who was licensed by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure, but was not an employee of the hospital. The patient sued the physician and the hospital based on allegations of paralysis and pain. She entered a settlement with the doctor, but received no award from the hospital after a lower court dismissed her case against the institution. The patient appealed the decision to the Appeals Court and won. The hospital then filed an appeal to that decision, which placed the case in front of the state Supreme Court.
<h2><strong><em>The argument for hospital accountability </em></strong></h2>
If it is ultimately decided that the hospital engaged in negligent credentialing, the institution may be liable for damages under the patient&apos;s medical malpractice claim. The argument for accountability centers on the surgeon, who was not an employee of the hospital. He worked at the hospital as an independent contractor and was granted staff privileges. According to the Commonwealth Journal, the doctor had reportedly been sued numerous times for malpractice in other states. He also allegedly had a history of substance abuse.

The patient argued that, by allowing the physician to perform her procedure, the hospital breached its duty to provide her with proper care, which included credentialing the physician who performed her surgery. Her argument essentially asserts that relying on the surgeon&apos;s license, without additional credentialing, is inadequate to meet a reasonable standard.
<h2><strong><em>The argument against hospital liability </em></strong></h2>
Conversely, the hospital asserted that there is no law or regulation requiring hospitals to perform credentialing for an independent contractor. It was also argued that if the court created a new cause of action for negligent credentialing, it would be placing an undue burden on small and rural medical centers.

While the court has yet to reach a ruling in the case, one justice did inquire about the difference between negligent credentialing and negligent hiring, which is a common cause of action in personal injury cases.

The skilled Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice lawyers of Crandall &amp; Pera Law have successfully handled numerous medical malpractice cases.

While this complication can be caused by a wide range of congenital diseases, it may also occur when a person&apos;s negligence causes injury to an innocent victim&apos;s spine. Treatment is extensive, long-term, and expensive, but a successful personal injury claim can go a long way toward helping a victim secure the medical treatment he or she needs.

<strong><em>What is curvature of the spine?</em></strong>

Some spine curvature is completely normal, and even healthy spines gently curve in order to absorb the shock of everyday movements. Problems arise when the natural curve of the spine becomes deformed, causing it to move away from the center of the back. There are three general types of types of spine curvatures:
<ul>
    <li>This sideways curvature causes the spine to move into an S or C shape. It is the most common form of the condition. When this type of curvature is present, an individual may present with one shoulder higher than the other or uneven hips. Severe back pain and discomfort is often associated with scoliosis.</li>
    <li>This is an inward curvature of the lower back. An individual may appear to have a hollowed lower back, with pronounced buttocks. Fracturing or slippage of the vertebrae are conditions that commonly lead to lordosis. It can make movement in certain direction difficult and cause extensive back pain.</li>
    <li>This fairly common condition presents as a humped upper back that curves by at least 50 degrees. Individuals may experience weakness in the legs and back, with severe cases causing extreme pain.</li>
</ul>
Each of these conditions is degenerative, meaning that it can worsen with time. Spinal cord injury victims may experience increased deterioration of the spine and worsening loss of function. Because extensive spinal curvature may not be immediately apparent following an accident, it is important that a treating physician perform diagnostic measures that can identify the condition or potential for development of the condition in the future.

As reported by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/05/03/researchers-medical-errors-now-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-united-states/?utm_term=.e452882bdccc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a>, these complications are now the third leading cause of death in the United States, ranking only behind cancer and heart disease. Surgical mistakes are a significant part of these errors. Each year, thousands of surgical patients have had to endure operations on incorrect body parts, unnecessary surgeries meant for other individuals, and surgical instruments left inside of their bodies. When patients leave the hospital with medical instruments, sponges, and other objects sewn into their bodies, they are negligently placed in danger of serious illness and even death.

Approximately 11 occurrences of surgical sponges being left inside patients take place in the United Sates each and every day. Experienced surgical error lawyers have seen how these negligent actions cause unnecessary pain and suffering. These errors often require additional surgical procedures to correct the mistake and treat resulting complications, including:
<ul>
    <li>Mass infections</li>
    <li>Digestive dysfunctions</li>
    <li>Breathing difficulties</li>
    <li>Coughing up blood</li>
    <li>Urinary and bowel dysfunctions</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>A surgical safety system could prevent patient injuries </em></strong>

Traditionally, hospitals use manual methods to ensure that all surgical sponges are accounted for after a procedure. According to a study reported by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/08/surgery-sponges-lost-supplies-patients-fatal-risk/1969603/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today,</a> researchers at New York&apos;s Mount Sinai found that these manual counts were only effective 77% of the time when items were left inside of patients. An additional study by Minnesota&apos;s Mayo Clinic uncovered even more disturbing data. These researchers found that counts were ineffective in 68% of cases where a surgical sponge was left inside of a patient.

To address these ineffective measures, more than 500 hospitals nationwide are using a new surgical safety system to prevent surgical sponge errors. A computerized counting system is used to uniquely identify each surgical sponge individually. This provides surgeons and their supporting staff an opportunity to account for each separate sponge before closing a patient at the completion of surgery.

Old accounting systems relied on a whiteboard that was erased when the surgery was completed. The new system maintains an electronic, permanent record that can be assessed as needed at later dates. One provider of this accounting system <a href="http://www.grbj.com/articles/88626-hospitals-absorb-surgical-safety-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that it has prevented more than 1,300 retained surgical sponges, which would have cost the health care industry about $825 million.

When surgeries leave patients with unexpected pain or additional complications, the attorneys of Crandall &amp; Pera Law help them bring claims against all responsible health care providers. With offices in Ohio and Kentucky, we are here when you need us.

These injuries may result in various physical disabilities, including but not limited to limb deficiencies. Compensation may be sought from the treating physician and medical center. But, when seeking compensation for a birth injury, it is important to not only consider the immediate damage, but also the challenges that these children will face throughout their lives.
<h2><strong><em>What is a limb deficiency?</em></strong></h2>
A limb deficiency refers to a condition where an individual&apos;s arms, hands, legs, or feet are debilitated in some way. These conditions can appear in a variety of ways. A child may not be able to move a portion of, or an entire limb, or one limb may be significantly smaller than the other. These conditions often stem from congenital conditions that develop within the womb, but an experienced birth injury lawyer knows that they can also be caused by physician actions during a birth, including:
<ul>
    <li>Failure to deliver in a timely manner</li>
    <li>Forceful extraction of the baby from the birth canal</li>
    <li>Failure to commence a cesarean section in a timely manner</li>
    <li>Improper administration of medications during the labor and delivery phase</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Long-term consequences for children with limb deficiencies</em></strong>

Children with limb deficiencies face substantial challenges during their critical formative years. The deficiency may give them an abnormal physical appearance that can lead to a lack of confidence. They may face teasing and name calling from other children. Those with movement limitations may not be able to participate in common childhood activities like riding a bike or playing on a jungle gym. Special accommodations may be necessary for school, as well as other desired extracurricular activities.

All of these consequences have a long-term effect on the psychological wellbeing of a child. Treatment for these conditions often includes the encouragement of self-care and independence, along with tools for adaptation. In some cases, surgical procedures are used to improve the cosmetic appearance caused by the deficiency. These treatments exemplify the difficulties faced by children with limb deficiencies and negligent physicians should be held adequately accountable when their actions cause this type of harm.

Birth injuries can prove extremely difficult for a child and the family. That is why the attorneys of Crandall &amp; Pera Law diligently advocate to secure high value compensation when helpless babies are harmed by medical malpractice. If you are considering a birth injury claim, call one of our conveniently located offices to schedule a confidential consultation. We serve residents of Ohio and Kentucky.

He was 27 years old when he hung himself in his cell in a Massachusetts prison, a mere 5 days after being acquitted of murdering two other people. He played a grand total of 44 games before his arrest.

After his death, an autopsy was done, and his brain was examined in a study done by Boston University. Those results, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/09/21/aaron-hernandez-was-suffering-from-advanced-form-of-cte-family-files-suit-against-nfl/?utm_term=.f5409a551339" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Washington Post</em></a>, found &#x201C;The 27-year-old had the second-most severe form of the disease [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][chronic traumatic encephalopathy] and one of the most advanced cases that researchers had seen in a subject his age.&#x201D; Despite his young age and the few number of games he played, Aaron Hernandez&#x2019;s brain showed signs of Stage III CTE &#x2013; a level of degeneration usually found in players twice his age.

His family has filed a lawsuit against the New England Patriots and the NFL: &#x201C;The lawsuit says the Patriots performed preseason exams of Hernandez and should have recognized signs of cognitive impairment. The NFL was &#x2018;fully aware of the damage that could be inflicted from repetitive impact injuries and failed to disclose, treat or protect him from the danger of such damage.&#x2019;&#x201D;
<h2>When will enough be enough?</h2>
This is not about turning Aaron Hernandez into a hero or a victim; it is about recognizing that for all the safety precautions, all the technology, all the big talk and lofty promises, <strong>no one is effectively protecting these players from permanent, life-threatening brain injuries</strong>.

As a reminder, this is what we <em>do</em> know.
<ul>
    <li>CTE has been linked to increased aggression, erratic behavior, and suicidal thoughts.</li>
    <li>Jovian Belcher, Tyler Sash, Ray Esterling, Dave Duerson, Andre Waters, and Junior Seau all killed themselves, and they all had CTE</li>
    <li>96% to 99% of deceased NFL players&#x2019; brains show signs of CTE</li>
</ul>
CTE cannot be diagnosed until a person has died, so there is no definitive way to determine whether or not a player has the disease &#x2013; but there are signs and symptoms. When players start presenting with these symptoms, we need to acknowledge them and treat the players as best we can, not ignore them and hope for the best. And we need to start doing it in high school, because <strong>as many as 20% of high school football players</strong> end up with the disease.

CTE is a progressive disease. There is no cure. It will eventually kill you. And if you play football, it almost certainly will.

Please. Choose the future. Choose your children. Choose life.

Law enforcement reported that the driver blacked out after taking heroin and his truck rolled backward and struck a guardrail. A police officer was able to revive the driver with an opioid antidote and he was charged with impaired driving and other violations. (<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/ohio/articles/2017-08-18/police-truck-driver-in-ohio-crash-blacked-out-after-heroin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USNews</a>)

The driver of a fuel tanker truck in Cleves, Ohio, overdosed at a gas station as his truck engine was running. The driver was found slumped on the floorboards of his truck, bleeding from the nose with heroin pills in the truck according to law enforcement. The driver was questioned by police and taken to Hamilton County Justice Center. (<a href="http://wreg.com/2017/07/12/fuel-truck-driver-overdosed-at-gas-station-with-vehicle-running-cleves-police-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WREG.com</a>)

Opioid use is fast becoming a serious safety risk for truck accidents in Ohio and throughout the United States. Where there was once a focus on the dangers of drunk driving, drug use among truck drivers is seen as an increasing cause of truck crashes in this country. The two incidents regarding overdosed truck drivers both concerned heroin use, which is not a prescription opioid, but heroin abuse often begins when an individual became addicted to prescription opioid pain killers.

Driving a truck is grueling work with demanding deadlines and schedules. If a truck driver is in pain from an injury or a health condition or just from the consequences of aging and doing sedentary work, they may turn to pain killers to enable them to keep their tough schedules. <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/rulemaking/2016-27398" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMCSA) regulations prohibit truck drivers to use opioid pain killers while they are driving, they can do so if they get a letter from their doctor saying that they can do so. There is nothing keeping a driver from using opioids and other drugs without disclosing them because federal regulations do not currently include opioid pain killers in truck driver drug tests.

In February, the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOT-OST-2016-0189-0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Transportation</a> (DOT) proposed a new rule which would add four opioids to the panel of drugs that truck drivers are tested for:&#xA0; hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and oxycodone. These drugs can seriously impair a driver&apos;s ability to operate a large truck safely, and they are notorious for causing those who take them to become addicted.
<h2>What are commercial truck fleet operators doing to combat drug use in truck drivers?</h2>
Currently, pre-employment, post incident, and random drug testing are done through urine testing, however, there is a movement afoot in favor of hair follicle drug testing because it is far more accurate that urine testing. Hair follicle testing can detect evidence of narcotic drug use as far back as 90-day, while a urine test can show evidence of about 60 days back. Additionally, it is impossible to cheat a hair follicle test, as the samples are collected by the technician conducting the test. Hair follicle testing costs as much as twice the price of a urine test, but its accuracy makes it worth the expense.

The comprehensive highway legislation, the FAST Act, which became law in 2015 under former President Obama, directs the FMCSA to accept hair follicle testing to satisfy the federal drug testing mandate for truck operators, but the law does not require them to do so until the department of Health and Human Services publishes guidelines for testing. These guidelines were due to Congress by December 2016; however, they are not expected to be completed until early 2018.

A coalition of 13 large commercial truck fleet operators has been pressing the FMCSA to allow them to use hair follicle testing alone rather than conducting both hair and urine testing because of the high cost of conducting both tests. Seven members of Congress sent a letter to the FMCSA in support of the trucking companies&apos; request. (<a href="http://www.ccjdigital.com/congressional-reps-ask-fmcsa-to-move-quickly-in-allowing-carriers-to-drug-test-drivers-via-hair-sample/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CCJ</a>)

Anyone who has suffered an injury in a truck accident caused by a truck driver who was impaired by drugs, you may be able to take legal action against the driver and the trucking company to recover compensation for your injuries and other losses.

We call these &#x201C;never events,&#x201D; because they are never supposed to happen. The term was invented by the National Quality Forum, a non-profit organization dedicated to patient safety and promoting quality healthcare.

The NQF has a detailed <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2006-Fact-sheets-items/2006-05-18.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of never events</a>, but there are five in the area of Surgical Events:
<ul>
    <li>&#x201C;Surgery performed on the wrong body part</li>
    <li>Surgery performed on the wrong patient</li>
    <li>Wrong surgical procedure on a patient</li>
    <li>Retention of a foreign object in a patient after surgery or other procedure</li>
    <li>Intraoperative or immediately post-operative death in a normal health patient (defined as a Class 1 patient for purposes of the American Society of Anesthesiologists patient safety initiative)&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
Despite the name, these types of errors do occur more often than they should. Between 1990 and 2010, there were &#x201C;9,744 paid malpractice settlement and judgments for surgical never events,&#x201D; according to one piece in the journal <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23257079" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Surgery</em></a>. Out of those events, &#x201C;Mortality occurred in 6.6% of patients, permanent injury in 32.9%, and temporary injury in 59.2%.&#x201D; The researchers estimate that just over 4,000 surgical never events occur in U.S. hospitals each year. You can <a href="http://content.hcpro.com/pdf/content/287732.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the full article here</a>.

This information was gathered from data in the <a href="https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/hcorg/whatYouMustReportToTheDataBank.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Practitioner Data Bank</a>, which collects information on medical malpractice payments and actions taken by licensing boards and facilities against medical personnel. However, not all adverse actions will end up being reported to the NPDB, which means the number of those actions will likely be higher than reported.
<h2>Surgical never events happen in Ohio hospitals, too</h2>
It can be easy to look at national statistics and assume they&#x2019;re happening &#x201C;elsewhere,&#x201D; but Ohio hospitals and medical facilities have their fair share of never events as well. (You can see the Leapfrog Group&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.leapfroggroup.org/hospitals/search/list/states/Ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full list of never event reporting here</a>.)

For example: in June of 2009, Kelly Maron underwent surgery to treat colon cancer. She was treated by Dr. Timothy Pritchard at a Lake Health Systems facility. In November of 2009, Kelly underwent another surgery because a <strong>surgical towel was left inside her upper abdomen during the first procedure</strong>. Kelly sought the counsel of Crandall &amp; Pera Law&#x2019;s Steve Crandall, and in 2011 filed a lawsuit against Pritchard and Lake Health. A jury found Dr. Pritchard and Lake Health Systems equally negligent in Kelly&#x2019;s case, and awarded her $910,000 in damages; it was believed to be the largest verdict ever rendered in Lake County.

Surgical malpractice of any kind is terrible, but circumstances like the ones Kelly Maron underwent are especially tragic. They are also entirely preventable. When a doctor or hospital fails to uphold its duty to do no harm, you may be entitled to compensation for your lost wages, your pain and suffering, your medical bills, and more.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight on behalf of patients who have sustained serious, even life-altering injuries as a result of medical negligence.

Road construction zones are required to maintain and expand our highways and roadways in safe condition. Those warning signs, the flashing lights, the orange cones, all those elements are designed to catch drivers&apos; attention and remind them to slow down and become more alert as they move through road construction zones to avoid accidents. It seems like regardless of all the safety measures and warning signs, accidents continue to occur in construction zones.

An unfortunate example of a construction zone accident on a Kentucky highway cost the lives of six people in July. <a href="http://www.bgdailynews.com/news/six-dead-in-crash-on-i/article_af66c464-15bf-5e7a-96ff-6092a32f7711.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Bowling Green Daily News</em></a> reported on the terrible crash that took the lives of four members of a family that was returning to their home in Indiana from a Florida vacation, another man in a separate vehicle and a truck driver were also killed. The crash occurred at about 10:30 pm in the northbound lanes of I-65 in an area where road construction was going on. It is also a place where the highway merges from three lanes to two lanes. One of the trucks, according to the <em>Daily News</em>, was stopped because of congestion in the right lane and the two passenger vehicles were behind it. A second semi, which was traveling in the same lane, failed to stop and it crashed into the first passenger vehicle and setting off a chain reaction crash.

Kentucky state trooper Jeremy Hodges was quoted in the <em>Daily News </em>story: &#x201C;With the work construction going on, whether the workers are present or not, everyone needs to pay attention. Be alert and be cognizant of your surroundings and slow down in the work zones.&#x201D;
<h2>Tips for safe driving in construction zones</h2>
The <a href="https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/resources/fhwasa03012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Highway Administration</a> offers these tips on avoiding construction zone accidents:
<ul>
    <li>Stay alert and minimize distractions</li>
    <li>Keep your headlights on</li>
    <li>Pay attention to the road, &quot;listen to the signs,&quot; watch for brake lights and be prepared to react quickly</li>
    <li>Merge into the proper lane</li>
    <li>Do not tailgate. Keep a safe driving distance between your car and the vehicle in front of you</li>
    <li>Obey the posted speed limits</li>
    <li>Change lanes safely</li>
    <li>Follow instructions from Flaggers</li>
    <li>Expect the unexpected in a construction zone</li>
    <li>Be patient</li>
</ul>
Also, be mindful when you are driving around tractor trailers and other large, commercial trucks to keep a safe distance from them in construction zones and on the highway. Large trucks have a much longer braking distance than passenger vehicles and they do not maneuver easily to avoid crashing into the smaller, more nimble vehicles with which they share the roadways.

Stay alert in construction zones and help keep our roads as safe as possible.

If you or someone you care about has been injured in an accident with a tractor-trailer or any other type of large, commercial truck, the skilled truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law are here to represent your interests as you pursue compensation for your injuries.

The skilled Kentucky truck accident lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law are ready to fight for the compensation you need after your serious injuries from a truck accident.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6186" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kentucky-Medical-Malpractice-Screening-Panels-300x200.jpg" alt="Kentucky Medical Malpractice Screening Panels" width="300" height="200">In June 2017, a new law went into effect in Kentucky, which calls for &quot;Medical Review Panels&quot; to review medical negligence cases before they can be filed in the court house. Sen. Ralph Alvarado (R-Winchester), who is also a physician, sponsored the legislation with the intention of limiting medical malpractice litigation in Kentucky. Now that <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/recorddocuments/bill/17RS/SB4/bill.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SB4</a> is in effect, an individual who wants to file a medical malpractice lawsuit must first file a complaint with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, which would then convene a panel to review the claim and decide if the case has sufficient merit to proceed to trial. There is a fee to file a complaint. If both parties agree, the review panel can be bypassed and the plaintiff can proceed to file their lawsuit.

<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/01/trying-beat-new-screening-panel-law-lawyers-file-96-medical-malpractice-cases-ky-t-his-week/444520001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>USA Today</em></a> reported that Alvarado said this new law will eliminate &#x201C;frivolous, nonsense lawsuits&#x201D; that &#x201C;happen all the time,&#x201D; which is a completely debunked statement which attempts to support the idea that there is a medical malpractice crisis in the United States, but that is just not true. Attempts at tort reform have been going on for decades while there is no evidence that the so-called crisis even exists. In a story in the <em>Washington Post</em>, Michael Matray, editor of Medical Liability Monitor, was quoted, &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful time for doctors looking for coverage, and it&apos;s never been better for insurers.&quot; The story reports that doctors are paying less for malpractice insurance than they did in 2001, and the rate of claims has dropped by half since 2003.

Prior to the passage of this new law, if an individual suffered an injury because of medical negligence, for example, if the doctor had misdiagnosed a disease, or a nurse made a pharmaceutical error, the injured party would have to show evidence of the following before they could pursue a civil claim for medical negligence:

There existed a doctor-patient relationship, which shows the doctor&apos;s duty of care to the patient
<ul>
    <li>The physician or other medical professional violated the standard of care</li>
    <li>The patient suffered an injury</li>
    <li>The violation or breach of the accepted standard of cares was the direct cause of the patient&#x2019;s injury</li>
</ul>
<h2>Kentucky Medical review panels</h2>
Now, in Kentucky, plaintiffs have a new hurdle to overcome in that they must present their evidence to the screening panel, which will decide whether the case can proceed to trial.

Kentucky joins 17 other states, which also have requirements that medical malpractice cases must be heard by a screening panel before trial. (NCSL.org)

The screening panel has nine months to reach a decision. If they have not reached a decision within nine months, the plaintiff can proceed to court. Filing a complaint with the screening panel tolls the statute of limitations until 90 days after the medical review panel has made their decision.
<h2>How is the screening panel composed?</h2>
The medical review panel or screening panel consists of one lawyer and three health care providers. The attorney acts as the chairperson of the panel, but does not have a vote. At the medical negligence trial, the screening panel&apos;s opinion may be admitted as an expert opinion.

Regardless of their findings, the medical review panels do not prevent plaintiff&apos;s from proceeding to trial.

CTE is a degenerative brain disease, which researchers have discovered in those that play football at the professional, college and even high school level.

From the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/breakthrough-may-lead-to-ability-to-diagnose-cte-in-living-football-players/2017/09/26/a6e1e8c4-a2bb-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html?utm_term=.b293c82e4844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a>:

&#x201C;In a new study published Tuesday [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][September 26, 2017] in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers from BU and the VA Boston Healthcare System studied the brains of 23 former football players who were diagnosed with CTE, in addition to those of 50 non-athletes who suffered from Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and 18 non-athlete controls. They found <strong>significantly elevated levels of a protein related to inflammation called CCL11</strong> in the group of ex-players compared with the non-athletes. The levels were even higher in those who played the game longer&#x201D; (emphasis ours).

This is an extraordinary development in the fight against the degenerative CTE. Until this discovery, no one had discovered a way to diagnose living patients with CTE; the diagnosis had to come post-mortem, during an autopsy.

The research into CCL11 as an indicator of CTE is still very, very new. At this point, the team at BU needs to determine whether or not the protein &#x201C;is a reliable sign of CTE, and that it can distinguish CTE from other degenerative brain diseases. And they must understand more precisely how levels of CLL11 that can be measured in the bloodstream reflect those present in the brain,&#x201D; as explained in the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/maryland-health/la-sci-sn-cte-biomarker-football-20170926-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baltimore Sun</a><em>.</em>

Still, the signs are positive. While CCL11 <em>was</em> found in brains of people with Alzheimer&#x2019;s, too, the levels were significantly higher in those brains diagnosed with CTE, and higher still when compared to tests run on people who were &#x201C;cognitively healthy&#x201D; when they died. Because the protein was found in spinal fluid (it is, as the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> points out, &#x201C;generally understood that anything that has escaped the brain into cerebrospinal fluid will find its way into circulating blood as well&#x201D;), a blood test for CTE could well be on its way.
<h2>Another nail in the coffin for CTE and football</h2>
We have been pouring through the evidence of the link between playing football and developing CTE for the last couple of years, and the latest study out of BU strengthens that link. The levels of CCL11 in the brains of former football players rose with the amount of time of play. In other words, the longer a person played football, the more of the protein could be found in the prefrontal brain.

We continue to ask: please &#x2013; do not let your children play football. It is basically guaranteed that they will develop a degenerative brain disease which could lead to depression, dementia, violent tendencies and suicidal thoughts. As parents ourselves, we know that there are so many things we cannot control; so many risks that we can attempt to prepare our children for, but may not be able to stop.

The decision to keep our kids of the gridiron? That <em>is</em> in our control. This is a risk we <em>can</em> avoid, a future we <em>can</em> help prevent.

Please. Choose the future. Choose your children. Choose life.

But what happens when a patient who is in excruciating pain from a terminal illness receives Tylenol, an over-the-counter headache remedy instead of the more powerful opioid pain medication Oxycodone. When a hospital patient or nursing home resident&apos;s pain medications are stolen and swapped out with a replacement medication, the crime is referred to as drug diversion, and as one aspect of the opioid epidemic it is rampant in the health care system in the United States.

<a href="http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/erica-lindsay-pharmd-mba-jd/2016/01/the-high-cost-of-drug-diversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Pharmacy Times</em></a> defines drug diversion as, &quot;the transfer of a prescription drug from a lawful to an unlawful channel of distribution or use.&quot; The estimated cost of controlled prescription drug diversion and abuse to both public and private insurers is about $72.5 billion each year. Physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other medical professionals with easy access to the medications in their workplace have all been found diverting drugs either to support a personal habit, or to sell for profit.

In July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice conducted the largest ever health care fraud enforcement action in a national health care fraud takedown, which resulted in charges against more than 412 individuals responsible for $1.3 billion in fraud losses. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/national-health-care-fraud-takedown-results-charges-against-over-412-individuals-responsible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Medicare Fraud Strike Force</a> charged 412 defendants across 41 federal districts including the Northern District of Ohio and the Western District of Kentucky, where 11 defendants were charged with defrauding the Medicaid program.&#xA0; In one case, four defendants, including three medical professionals, were charged with distributing controlled substances and fraudulently billing the Medicaid program.

The defendants allegedly participated in schemes to submit claims to Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare for treatments that were not medically necessary and in some cases never provided. &#x201C;Last year, an estimated 59,000 Americans died from a drug overdose, many linked to the misuse of prescription drugs. This is, quite simply, an epidemic,&#x201D; said Acting Administrator Rosenberg. &#x201C;There is a great responsibility that goes along with handling controlled prescription drugs, and DEA and its partners remain absolutely committed to fighting the opioid epidemic using all the tools at our disposal.&#x201D;
<h2>The consequences of drug diversion</h2>
In Pennsylvania, 17 patients are suing the Jefferson Regional Medical Center for negligence after being denied pain medication after a hospital pharmacy technician replaced it with a medication that had a similar appearance. The complaint alleges that an estimated 362 patients may have received non-narcotic medication after the pharmacy technician replace it. The Pharmacy tech pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring a controlled substance, theft, and recklessly endangering another person. she was ordered to serve six to 12 months in jail with three months of probation. The negligence claim includes allegations that the hospital failed to check medications that were being given to patients, the failure to supervise employees and the failure to have a system in place to inventory medications and prevent their theft according to a story in the <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2017/09/13/Jefferson-Hospital-pa-lawsuit-oxycodone-pills-pain-medication-cheryl-ashcraft/stories/201709130197" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Post-Gazette</em></a>.

In Iowa, nine patients filed a lawsuit against Iowa Methodist Medical Center, which accuses the hospital of negligence in failing to supervise a pharmacy technician who stole Fentanyl in 2016 between August and October. The employee used a syringe to withdraw the medication and they refilled the vials with a saline solution. The pharmacy technician admitted to the charges, was fired and relinquished his state license. As of August 2017 no criminal charges have been filed and the case is with the Assistant U.S. Attorney according to a story in the <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2017/08/23/no-charges-filed-despite-ex-hospital-employees-admission-he-stole-patients-painkillers/594702001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>De Moines Register</em></a><em>.</em>

The FMCSA intends for the devices, which connect to the trucks electronic control module (ECM), to automatically record the date, time, location, how long the engine has been running and how many miles the vehicle has traveled. The device must also authenticate the user with their driver ID. An ELD tracks when the vehicle is in motion, when it is shut down and when the driver&apos;s duty status changes.

The goal of the ELD mandate is to automatically provide a tamper-proof record of the driver&apos;s compliance with the FMCSA&apos;s Hours of Service (HOS) regulations. HOS rules govern how many hours a truck driver can drive, how long they can go between breaks and how long those breaks need to be before they can restart their work day. Truck drivers are not supposed to drive for too many days in a row, or drive for more than 11 hours at a stretch.

Until the advent of ELDs, however, truck drivers logged those details on paper logs.&#xA0; If the driver was involved in a truck accident, one of the most important things to examine in the ensuing investigation was the driver&apos;s ROD log. Now that this data is being tracked electronically and directly from the truck&#x2019;s engine, accident investigators will get an accurate gauge of the factors that might have contributed to causing the crash.
<h2>The FMCSA hopes that ELDs will reduce truck crashes from driver fatigue</h2>
<a href="https://www.vtti.vt.edu/research/ctbs/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Center for Truck and Bus Safety of Virginia Tech Transportation</a> Institute conducted a study that revealed commercial truck drivers who used ELDs had 11.7% fewer crashes and 5.1% fewer predicable crashes than commercial drives who did not use an ELD.

<a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (</a>NHTSA) reports that there were 667 traffic fatalities from truck accidents and 30,000 injuries in 2015, which is up from the previous year by 1 percent and 11 percent respectively.

This is not to say that large commercial truck drivers are the only motorists who drive on too little sleep and cause accidents. Drowsy driving is what the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/features/dssleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>(CDC) calls a &quot;public health epidemic,&quot; with more than 70 million American adults having some type of sleep disorder. Tackling the safety challenge of drowsy driving in commercial truck drivers is because they operate massive vehicles that can cause catastrophic accidents when the driver falls asleep at the wheel while driving on the highway among other smaller, more vulnerable passenger vehicles.

The accident attorneys of Crandall &amp; Pera Law understand the severity of injuries associated with accidents caused by drowsy truck drivers, and the financial burdens that often accompany them.

Recently, a story about nerve stimulation caught our eye &#x2013; not because of the risks that might be associated with it, but because of an extraordinary response it has had on a man in a persistent vegetative state (PVS).

<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/25/nerve-implant-restores-consciousness-to-man-in-vegetative-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a> reports that a new &#x201C;treatment challenges a widely-accepted view that there is no prospect of a patient recovering consciousness if they have been in PVS for longer than 12 months.&#x201D; By stimulating the vagus nerve, doctors were able to elicit a response form a man who had been in this state for 15 years. The patient had severe brain injuries as a result of a car crash; he had been in a persistent vegetative state ever since. But after doctors fitted him with the implant, he seemingly regained consciousness. The article says:

&#x201C;He started to track objects with his eyes, began to stay awake while being read a story and his eyes opened wide in surprise when the examiner suddenly moved her face close to the patient&#x2019;s. He could even respond to some simple requests, such as turning his head when asked &#x2013; although this took about a minute.

Angela Sirigu, who led the work at the Institut des Sciences Cognitives Marc Jeannerod in Lyon, France, said: &#x2018;He is still paralyses, he cannot talk, but he can respond. Now he is more aware.&#x2019;&#x201D;
<h2>How does the implant work?</h2>
The device is surgically implanted into the vagus nerve &#x2013; the longest cranial nerve in the body, running from your brain stem all the way to your stomach. The device was placed in the area of the patient&#x2019;s neck, and stimulator was implanted in his chest. Once the device is set, it sends little pulses of electricity to the vagus nerve.

There was no guarantee it would work: after all, as <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/experimental-nerve-stimulation-therapy-partially-revives-man-long-term-vegetative-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Science</em></a> explains &#x201C;Such nerve stimulation has been explored as a therapy for a wide range of disorders such as epilepsy, depression, arthritis, and cluster headaches, although it&#x2019;s unclear exactly why it works.... Electrically stimulating the thalamus can temporarily rouse a person in a minimally conscious state, and Sirigu wondered what would happen if she stimulated it for long periods of time.&#x201D;

What happened, in short, was that it worked. The patient&#x2019;s progress has, of course, been slow &#x2013; but it is <em>there</em>. And that is extraordinary, because being in a persistent vegetative state is a frustrating half-life for both the patients suspended there, and for their families. In a coma, a person is more or less in a prolonged sleep; in PVS, that person may have some low-level brain function, but not enough to communicate wants and needs to their caretakers.

This experimental therapy may have just changed all of that, opening a new world of possibility for victims and their loved ones. There is no way of knowing how much farther the patient can or will progress with more treatment &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s a pretty good start.

Being injured in a car crash or falling are the two most common ways in which Americans suffer TBI. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/basics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) estimates that 2.5 million Americans suffered from a traumatic brain injury, with 14% caused by traffic accidents and 40% as the result of a fall.

The severity of a TBI can range from mild to severe. When a person sustains a brain injury in a car crash where the vehicles were traveling at high speed when they collided, the delicate structures of the brain, which is essentially floating inside of the protective skull, can collide back and forth between the inside front and back of the skull. With severe brain injury, there is often loss of consciousness which can range from just a few seconds or a day or more if the accident victim ends up in a coma.
<h2>What is the life impact of a traumatic brain injury?</h2>
After suffering a traumatic brain injury in a car crash, there is no such thing as a typical long-term effect from the injury as all injuries are different. There are some symptoms and lasting effects that tend to be common among TBI victims, and the Ohio Valley Center for Brain Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation at Ohio University (OVC) <a href="http://ohiovalley.org/informationeducation/long-termconsequences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lists the following</a>:
<ul>
    <li>Seizures</li>
    <li>Cognitive deficits</li>
    <li>Depression</li>
    <li>Aggression</li>
    <li>Unemployment or social isolation</li>
    <li>Premature death</li>
    <li>Decline in cognitive function</li>
    <li>Progressive dementia</li>
    <li>Parkinsonism</li>
    <li>Endocrine dysfunction, hypopituitarism</li>
</ul>
According to OVC, TBI is a chronic health condition that has a long-term, deleterious effect on overall health for some individuals. The type and severity of the effects of TBI may be proportional to the severity of the injury.
<h2>Life care planning after a traumatic brain injury</h2>
When an individual has suffered a catastrophic injury such as a traumatic brain injury, the injury will cause lasting damage that will impact the quality of their life. As part of a lawsuit to recover financial compensation for their injuries, the injured person would have to present a comprehensive calculation for how much it will cost to cover the ongoing medical care and all the other costs associated with caring for someone with a permanent brain injury.

The injured person would work catastrophic injury attorney to develop a plan that would take into consideration their care at home or health care facility, what kinds of medical equipment they might require, medications and vocational issues such as their functional capacity.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our TBI attorneys represent your interest when you have been hurt and have permanent injuries because of someone else&#x2019;s negligence. If you would like compassionate, yet aggressive representation, you are welcome to call our Kentucky lawyers at 877-686-8879, our Ohio team at 877-686-8879, or use our <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact form</a> to make an appointment now.

Imagine, for a minute, how different things could be if October was National Breast Cancer <em>Vaccine</em> Month, instead.

As it turns out, it could be &#x2013; thanks to <a href="https://www.lerner.ccf.org/immuno/tuohy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Vincent Tuohy</a> of the Cleveland Clinic. For the last 15 years, Dr. Tuohy has struggled to find funding for vaccines that could eradicate breast and ovarian cancers. <a href="http://www.freshwatercleveland.com/features/tuohy102617.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresh Water Cleveland</a> reports:

&#x201C;If Tuohy&apos;s lab results are any indication [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][of a vaccine that works], he may be well on his way. Over the last two years, Tuohy has been conducting animal research by transgenically manipulating mice to develop breast cancer within 10 months of age. Some of the mice were vaccinated at two months old, while others were not given vaccines. &#x2018;At 10 months, none [of the vaccinated mice] had tumors, and all of the control mice had tumors,&#x2019; says Tuohy, who has replicated the same results three times with success.&#x201D;

A vaccine that prevents breast cancer; that&#x2019;s 40,000 lives saved. A vaccine that can prevent ovarian cancer; that&#x2019;s another 15,000 women saved from death. A total of 55,000 lives could be saved <em>every year</em>.
<h2>Why doesn&#x2019;t anyone want to fund this extraordinary research?</h2>
It all comes down to money. The National Cancer Institute gives five times more money to treatment than it does to prevention, and they&#x2019;re not the only ones. Science is so focused on curing the disease once it develops, that it has largely ignored the idea of preventing that development in the first place.

Another concern, especially when it comes to cancer funding, is that &#x201C;cancer&#x201D; is not <em>a</em> disease &#x2013; it&#x2019;s hundreds of diseases, and those illnesses can be further split within each group. For example, the type of cancer Dr. Tuohy&#x2019;s vaccine would target is called Triple Negative Breast Cancer &#x2013; a cancer responsible for about 50% of all breast cancer-related deaths (though it only accounts for between 16% and 20% of all breast cancers.)

But once you have a vaccine that works for one, you can create different vaccines that would target others. And thanks to the efforts of a number of grassroots organizations, Dr. Tuohy was given a $6 million grant from the Department of Defense, of all things, to pursue his research. His paper about his work with a vaccine for ovarian cancer is scheduled to be published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Society of Cancer Research</em> next month.
<h2>Help make a breast cancer vaccine a reality</h2>
The Cleveland community has stepped up efforts to help Dr. Tuohy, but this type of scientific breakthrough takes time, effort and money. One of the programs that supports Dr. Tuohy&#x2019;s efforts is <a href="http://www.brakesforbreasts.com/brakes-for-breasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brakes for Breasts</a> &#x2013; an organization made up of more than 100 independent auto shops throughout the country, and started by two women from Cleveland. The Women Who Care About Breast Cancer Coalition, founded by Dr. Marjorie Moyar and Race for the Cure organizer Susan Larson, is also helping in the fight for funding, and has worked with organizations like Daughters of Penelope, the Philoptochos Society, and the Junior League.

Let&#x2019;s all do our part this year in the fight against breast cancer. Supporting the work of Dr. Tuohy&#x2019;s vaccines could ensure that he meets his goal of clinical trials in 2018. We hope you&#x2019;ll join us in helping him achieve that goal, and finding a way to prevent breast and ovarian cancer for good.

The woman driving the car was pronounced dead on the scene, and the force of the collision was enough to eject a car seat from the from the vehicle; thankfully, no child was in the seat at the time. According to <a href="http://fox8.com/2017/10/09/driver-killed-when-car-crashes-head-on-into-cleveland-fire-truck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 8 Cleveland</a>, &#x201C;Investigators reconstructed the crash to help determine exactly what happened. Police said they believe the woman was driving faster than the posted 25 mile-per-hour speed limit when she crossed the center line and hit the fire truck.&#x201D; One firefighter was taken to the hospital.

This was the second accident between a car and a CDF truck; a few hours earlier, on October 8<sup>th</sup>, a different ladder truck was blocking off an accident when a car struck it. In that collision, no one was injured, and no further details were given about that crash.
<h2>Ohio&#x2019;s laws regarding emergency vehicles</h2>
Under the law, Ohio considers these to be &#x201C;<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/ohio/2016/title-45/chapter-4511/section-4511.01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public safety vehicles</a>:&#x201D;
<ul>
    <li>Ambulances</li>
    <li>Cop cars (including vehicles by local/municipal, state or federal officers)</li>
    <li>Fire trucks and vehicles used by volunteers</li>
    <li>EMS/EMTS trucks/vans</li>
</ul>
Anyone driving an emergency or public safety vehicle may pass through an intersection (including those with red lights) when he or she is responding to an emergency situation. They may also use &#x201C;<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/ohio/2016/title-45/chapter-4511/section-4511.031/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portable preemption signal devices&#x201D;</a> when responding to an emergency, which change the sequence of traffic lights, creating a &#x201C;green&#x201D; where there was one a red. In fact, public safety vehicles are exempt from <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/ohio/2016/title-45/chapter-4511/section-4511.041/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost every traffic law</a> in Ohio, as long as the driver is &#x201C;responding to an emergency call, is equipped with and displaying at least one flashing, rotating, or oscillating light visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of five hundred feet to the front of the vehicle and if the driver of the vehicle is giving an audible signal by siren, exhaust whistle, or bell,&#x201D; though &#x201C;This section does not relieve the driver of an emergency vehicle or public safety vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons and property upon the highway.&#x201D;

Of course, we want our emergency vehicles to be able to clear a path to the hospital or the scene of a crime, and to get to whomever needs them &#x2013; but this can sometimes create confusion on the roadways. That is why, once a driver hears the signal or sees the flashing light, he or she must be aware of where the vehicle is, and yield the right of way. If a fire truck, ambulance, police car or other emergency vehicle is behind you on any road, or traveling in the opposite direction towards you on a one-lane roadway, you should immediately pull to the right to get out of the way. If one of these vehicles is approaching an intersection, but you would normally have the right of way, proceed slowly so the emergency vehicle can cross through an intersection.

Emergency services cannot behave recklessly, because the safety of other drivers is one of their priorities. But they are given leeway in following the rules when responding to a fire or a call, and as such, we must be on guard when we share the road with them.

The <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2017/10/30/medical-review-panels-law-kentucky-struck-down/812570001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Courier-Journal</a> cited Judge Shepherd&#x2019;s order:

&quot;The effect of the medical review panel process is not the reduction of frivolous negligence claims, but rather, the erection of barriers to the court system. Those that cannot afford the additional delays and costs should not be prevented from pursuing their constitutional right to a &apos;remedy by due course of law.&apos; &quot;

Plans to challenge the order are already being made by the Governor&#x2019;s office, according to a spokeswoman. For now, however, the rights of victims of medical malpractice are safe in Kentucky.
<h2>Why Kentucky&#x2019;s medical review panels posed a problem to malpractice victims</h2>
On June 29, 2017, Kentucky implemented a law that required victims of medical malpractice and nursing home abuse and neglect, to submit all lawsuits to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Once submitted, a panel of three medical providers and one attorney were supposed to review the case within 6 months of receiving it. Even if they felt no negligence had occurred, their opinion would be submitted, <em>as evidence</em>, into any lawsuit brought before a court.

    <li>Kentucky Legislation to Establish Medical Review Panel</li>
    <li>Kentucky&#x2019;s Senate Bill 6 Can Only Harm Injury Victims</li>
</ul>
The State claimed this would cut down on the number of &#x201C;frivolous&#x201D; lawsuits brought against facilities each year. But as any plaintiff&#x2019;s medical malpractice attorney, or victim of medical malpractice, could tell you, this assumption is based on myths.

<strong>First</strong>, there are very few frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits because the costly expenses associated with bringing these cases. Necessary expert fees and document production can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars if a case goes to trial; Crandall &amp; Pera Law regularly takes cases that cost that much or more. All of those costs are paid out by the firm, because our attorneys work on contingency. If we took cases without merit, our firm would be bankrupted &#x2013; and so would every other plaintiff firm in the country. In fact, that is one of many reasons most Crandall &amp; Pera Law cases are referrals from other firms: we have the financial resources to prosecute even the most complex malpractice case.

<strong>Second</strong>, you have the right to a fair trial. An opinion submitted by doctors about doctors is hardly unbiased in and of itself; in a trial situation, it would be a boon to the defense, making the playing field unlevel. Furthermore, the doctors on the panel do not even have to practice in the specialty that caused you harm. As Judge Shepherd points out in his order, &#x201C;a dermatologist or social worker might be called upon to render an opinion about malpractice allegations against a brain surgeon.&quot;

<strong>Finally</strong>, the fees of the panel &#x2013; which could run to the thousands of dollars &#x2013; would need to be paid by the party it sides with. Who do you think has more money: a hospital, or a single mother of three who cannot work because a surgical error left her unable to walk?

Judge Shepherd did the honorable thing, by ensuring justice for the victims of medical malpractice. We have fought against this law before, and we will fight against it in the future, if it is challenged by the state. Crandall &amp; Pera Law will always fight for people who have been hurt by medical malpractice, another person&#x2019;s negligent actions, or because of the abuse or neglect of nursing home staff.

In fact, <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report </em>ranks them <a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/oh/cleveland-clinic-6410670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second in the nation</a> for overall care. If you weren&#x2019;t from the area, you might think that having the Cleveland Clinic right around the corner would be a boon, if you ever needed care.

We are, however, from the area. And we also know that the <em>U.S. News</em> ranking is an outlier. The fact is, when you look at every other ranking system, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation has a long and storied history of problems, is frequently cited for its dangerous processes and environments, and is repeatedly subject to lawsuits alleging medical negligence and malpractice. We should know; Steve Crandall won a $7.7 million jury verdict against the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in 2014 for malpractice, on behalf of one of its own neurosurgeons &#x2013; and that is not the only case our firm has taken.
<h2>How bad are the Cleveland Clinic Foundation&#x2019;s safety scores, really?</h2>
In December of 2014, Kaiser Health News released a <a href="http://cdn.kaiserhealthnews.org/attachments/HACPenaltyChart.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penalty chart</a> for every hospital that accepted Medicare patients, with scores regarding their ability to eliminate hospital-acquired infections. Each facility was given a score of 1-10 (1 being the best, and 10 being the worst) for central-line associated bloodstream infections, catheter associated urinary tract infections, and serious complications, like blood clots, falls and bed sores. Each of these conditions, remember, are largely preventable.

Here are the Cleveland Clinic Foundation&#x2019;s scores:
<ul>
    <li>Serious complications: 10</li>
    <li>Central line infections: 8</li>
    <li>Urinary tract infections: 7</li>
    <li><strong>Total HAC score: 8.375</strong></li>
</ul>
Even though the CCF has been routinely ranked as one of the best hospitals in the country, they were penalized by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for how poorly they handled HACs.

And that is only one group.
<h2>Recent rankings from &#x201C;respected&#x201D; databases</h2>
Here is how the Cleveland Clinic Foundation measures up now, according to three popular data collators.

<strong>Leapfrog Group</strong>

The news about the CCF&#x2019;s problems started really making headlines in 2012, when the Leapfrog Group gave the Clinic a <a href="http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/leadership/leapfrogs-new-safety-report-card-alarms-hospitals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety score of &#x201C;D.&#x201D;</a> Its most recent grade is an &#x201C;A,&#x201D; so it looks like the Clinic made a massive improvement in only 5 years &#x2013; pretty impressive, no?

Well, actually, no. And here is why: Leapfrog Group, like U<em>.S. News</em>, relies entirely on what is voluntarily given, as well as what can be found publicly, to grade its hospitals. Furthermore, with a little digging into that safety score, you realize that Leapfrog&#x2019;s scores are modal: they rely on whatever grade is earned the most often, not an average of the grades.

Here is how that plays out in the real world, using the category &#x201C;<a href="http://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/h/cleveland-clinic-foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Problems with Surgery</a>.&#x201D; There are 7 areas of that particular category. The Cleveland Clinic earned a ranking of &#x201C;above average&#x201D; in four of them:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Surgical wound splits open</strong>: someone monitors surgery patients to ensure that their stitches stay intact.</li>
    <li><strong>Death from treatable serious complications</strong>: patients are monitored to ensure that no complications arise, and if they do, those patients are treated correctly so the patient doesn&#x2019;t die.</li>
    <li><strong>Collapsed lung</strong>: they can treat a collapsed lung.</li>
    <li><strong>Accidental cuts and tears</strong>: surgeons don&#x2019;t cut where they&#x2019;re not supposed to cut.</li>
</ol>
Note that these &#x201C;above average&#x201D; scores don&#x2019;t indicate how often collapsed lungs happen, or how quickly patients are treated if they develop a complication. All we know for sure is that the surgeons <em>can</em> treat the condition, and that people don&#x2019;t die from complications that often.

Now, let us look at the other three areas:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Serious breathing problem</strong>: a complication that sometimes develops after surgery. CCF is ranked &#x201C;average&#x201D; in this category.</li>
    <li><strong>Dangerous object left in patient&#x2019;s body</strong>: the textbook example of a &#x201C;never event.&#x201D; CCF is ranked &#x201C;below average&#x201D; in this category.</li>
    <li><strong>Dangerous blood clot</strong>: clots can form when tissue is damaged during surgery. If the clots travel into the brain or heart, they can be fatal. CCF is ranked &#x201C;below average&#x201D; for the number of their patients who develop clots.</li>
</ol>
If you took an average of these categories, the grade would <em>not</em> be an &#x201C;A.&#x201D; But Leapfrog doesn&#x2019;t average its scores, and that is why a hospital like the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, which scores below average when it comes to leaving foreign objects inside of a body during surgery, can still be rated as an &#x201C;A&#x201D; hospital.

And to add insult to injury? The Clinic didn&#x2019;t supply any data at all when it came to <a href="http://www.leapfroggroup.org/hospital/profile/Cleveland+Clinic+Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infections</a>.

<strong>GuideStar</strong>

<a href="https://www.guidestar.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GuideStar</a> bills itself as &#x201C;the world&apos;s largest source of information on nonprofit organizations.&#x201D; Since the Cleveland Clinic Foundation is a non-profit teaching hospital (with a budget of $4.5 billion), GuideStar includes it in its database.

But just like Leapfrog, GuideStar relies on entirely <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/profile/91-2153073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-reported information</a>. The data and information you see has been written by the CCF, and provided to GuideStar. Its financials and operations are behind a paywall, but there is a section titled &#x201C;Board Leadership Practices,&#x201D; which reviews things like CEO oversight, and assessment of the Board&#x2019;s performance. This section also covers ethics and transparency, and is, interestingly enough, is left blank.

<strong>Consumer Reports</strong>

Consumer Reports also offers a ranking system for the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Their overall Safety Score is a 54, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/10/how-we-rate-hospitals/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their rankings</a> are based on information provided by the CMS, and &#x201C;from scientifically-based data on patient experience and outcomes as well as certain hospital practices gathered from public sources. Some of that information is available elsewhere.&#x201D; That data includes information about:
<ul>
    <li>Hospital-acquired infections (central line infections, surgical site infections, MRSA, <em> diff</em> and catheter-associated urinary tract infections)</li>
    <li>Childbirth (and avoiding C-sections)</li>
    <li>Safety scores (hospital acquired infections, readmissions, mortality &#x2013; and its avoidance &#x2013; scans, medication and communication)</li>
    <li>Heat surgery (bypass, aortic valve and congenital)</li>
    <li>Patient experience</li>
</ul>
The also review cleanliness of rooms and bathrooms, communication, and pain control, among others.

In the Consumer Reports review, Cleveland Clinic Foundation is all over the map, scoring &#x201C;better&#x201D; than average for chest scanning, but &#x201C;worse&#x201D; than average when it comes to the readmissions of Medicare patients. You can <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/hospitals/cleveland-clinic/safety-score/6410670/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find all of their rankings here</a>.
<h2>Medical negligence lawsuits in Ohio</h2>
There is no one database that contains the exact number of medical malpractice lawsuits have been filed against the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, or how many people have died as a result of poor care. Because of the <a href="https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/npdbstats/npdbStatistics.jsp#contentTop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Practitioner Data Base</a>, we can tell you that there were 216 medical malpractice payments made by Ohio doctors in 2016, and that there were 2,283 adverse actions reported. We can tell that you 2,088 doctors had state licensure actions taken, but only 24 doctors were involved in anything regarding their clinical privileges.

To recap: there were 2,283 cases of adverse actions, but only 24 doctors had their clinical privileges revoked.
<h2>Why all of these numbers matter</h2>
We know that most people rely on reviews &#x2013; either from friends or from online &#x2013; when they want to try a new service or product. We&#x2019;ve even recommended looking at the reviews ourselves, as part of your research. But you have to take them with a grain of salt, especially when they come from databases where self-reporting is necessary.

The Cleveland Clinic Foundation may have an &#x201C;A&#x201D; grade from one source, or a high rank from another, but the doctors and medical personnel there are just as fallible as any other, and, in some cases, more than others. If you sustained an injury because of medical malpractice, you shouldn&#x2019;t be afraid to come forward, just because it&#x2019;s a nationally known facility. The right malpractice attorney knows how to stand against up against the &#x201C;big guys,&#x201D; and will have the skills, experience and financial resources necessary to take them on when you&#x2019;ve been hurt.

The plywood came loose form the bed of the truck and flew across the lanes of traffic. Several cars were involved in the incident, according to the report on Kentucky.com, but the driver of the truck died at the hospital.

The loose cargo contributed to the swerving, and collisions, of the other vehicles at the scene, but it was a medical emergency that started the cascade effect. The <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/medical/medical-examination-report-form-commercial-driver-medical-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMCSA) &#x201C;requires that interstate commercial motor vehicle drivers maintain a current Medical Examiner&#x2019;s Certificate (MEC), Form MCSA-5876 to drive. As part of the physical, drivers are required to fill out the medical history portion of the Medical Examination Report (MER) Form, MCSA-5875.&#x201D; On their site, they have packages related to hearing, vision, seizures and diabetes, all of which require separate guidelines and actions from their drivers.

The FMCSA requires drivers to be <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/faq/what-happens-if-driver-not-truthful-about-hisher-health-history-medical-examination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">truthful in their medical history</a>. In fact, &#x201C;Deliberate omission or falsification of information may invalidate the examination and any certificate issued based on it. A civil penalty may also be levied against the driver under 49 U.S.C. 521(b)(2)(b), either for making a false statement of for concealing a disqualifying condition.&#x201D;

However, a medical condition will not necessarily disqualify a driver from being issued an MEC; some conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure and stable angina have exemption clauses. Prescribed medications, including controlled substances, are also allowed, provided the driver&#x2019;s doctor says that the driver is safe to work as long as he or she takes the medication.
<h2>Assessing liability in a medical emergency that leads to a truck accident</h2>
Let us say, for example, that a driver with a perfectly healthy medical record suffers a heart attack while behind the wheel of the truck. If there is no previous medical history to indicate a potential heart attack, and if he or she tests clean for all drug use &#x2013; if it really was, by all accounts, an unavoidable emergency &#x2013; then the driver and his company may not be liable for the damages.

In some cases, however, multiple parties may be liable for the truck crash, including the driver, the trucking company, the medical examiner, the doctor or even the drug manufacturer. Those cases might include:
<ul>
    <li>The driver deliberately lying about his or her history</li>
    <li>The driver using medication or controlled substances while not under the supervision or prescription of the doctor</li>
    <li>The trucking company failing to disqualify a driver whose health indicates he or she is unsafe to drive</li>
    <li>Deliberate omission or falsifications by the doctor or medical examiner, leading to a driver being certified when he or she should not have been</li>
    <li>A defective medical device, such as a pacemaker, failing to function while the driver is on the road</li>
    <li>A dangerous reaction to a prescription drug that was not previously disclosed to the driver</li>
</ul>
One of the first things our Kentucky truck accident lawyers do, when looking into a collision, is request a copy of the black box data. Commercial trucks have devices which can record what happened before the crash. While the device will not specifically say &#x201C;The driver had a heart attack,&#x201D; the information it provides can help fill in any gaps about what happened.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight on behalf of people who have sustained serious, life-threatening injuries because of a collision with a commercial vehicle. If you were hurt in a truck crash, our Kentucky team is ready to help. Please call 877-686-8879 or fill out our <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact form</a> to learn more.

BODY:
James Dempsey was a decorated WWII veteran. He died in 2014, at the age of 94, while at the Northeast Atlanta Health and Rehabilitation Center. On the day he died, he called out for help six times: &#x201C;Nurse, help me please!&#x201D; he called. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t breathe.&#x201D;

By the time the nurses showed up, Mr. Dempsey was unresponsive. It took an hour before anyone called 911. The staff started and stopped CPR multiple times, and laughed when they could not get his oxygen machine to work. We know this happened, because a DeKalb County judge allowed WXIA-TV to publish the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/disturbing-video-shows-dying-wwii-vet-neglected-nursing-home-193149764.html?.tsrc=fauxdal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hidden camera video footage</a> that showed exactly what happened.

<strong>WARNING:</strong> the following video is graphic in nature. Viewer discretion is advised.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lU6NlK3OQDc" width="650" height="366" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The nursing home learned of the video in 2015, but it took then <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/11/18/veteran-dies-calling-help-gasping/876787001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 months to fire the nurses</a>, according to a <em>USA Today</em> report. <em>Newsweek</em> reports that it took until September of 2017 &#x2013; three years &#x2013; before the nurses were made to <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/nurses-laugh-wwii-veteran-calls-help-and-dies-716102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surrender their licenses</a>. Northeast Atlanta Health and Rehabilitation is still open and operational, despite &#x201C;Medicare records show[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][ing] the nursing home facility was cited at least two dozen times for serious health and safety violations, including &#x2018;immediate jeopardy&#x2019; levels, the worst violation. Medicare withdrew one payment and the facility has been fined $813,113 since 2015.&#x201D;
<h2>This type of abuse and neglect is not unique to Georgia</h2>
What happened to Mr. Dempsey is horrific, but it is far from a one-off experience. In August of 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General issued a memo about its ongoing research into reports of abuse and neglect in nursing homes which take on Medicare patients. (Private facilities, or facilities which do not accept Medicare, will not be included.) <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region1/11700504.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That memo is damning:</a>

&#x201C;For example, OIG&#x2019;s recent audit reports on critical incident reporting at group homes showed that group home providers did not report up to 15 percent of critical incidents to the appropriate State agencies. Furthermore, OIG&#x2019;s study of adverse events in [Skilled Nursing Facilities, or SNFs] found that an estimated 22 percent of Medicare beneficiaries experienced adverse events during their SNF stays. These adverse events included infections, pressure ulcers, and medication-induced bleeding. Medical record review determined that 69 percent of these patient-harm events could have been prevented had the SNF provided better care. Over half of the residents harmed during their SNF stays required hospital care to treat the adverse event.&#x201D;

Kentucky has also had more than its fair share of problems when it comes to abuse and neglect. As we discussed in September, Kentucky is among the worst offenders in the country. Brian Lee, the executive director of the non-profit citizen advocacy group <a href="https://familiesforbettercare.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Families for Better Care</a>, told the&#xA0;<a href="http://kycir.org/2014/10/22/a-powerful-nursing-home-owner-and-a-push-for-medical-review-panels-in-kentucky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting</a> that &#x201C;there&#x2019;s widespread abuse, neglect, mistreatment of residents occurring in far too many nursing homes.&#x201D;

Earlier this year, the <em>Courier-Journal</em> reported on Kentucky&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/life/wellness/health/2017/07/11/kentucky-and-indiana-called-worst-u-s-long-term-care-elderly-disabled/417755001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor rankings for long-term care services</a> for the elderly and disabled, as well as the State&#x2019;s programs for transitioning elderly individuals into assisted living facilities and nursing homes. The rankings, compiled by the AARP Foundation, said &#x201C;Kentucky&#x2019;s worst ranking &#x2013; 49th &#x2013; came in quality of life and quality of care. That&#x2019;s a broad category that encompasses such measures as the rate of employment for working-age adults with certain disabilities; the percent of high-risk nursing home residents with pressure sores; and the percent of long-stay nursing home residents who are receiving an antipsychotic medication.&#x201D;

What happened to Mr. Dempsey is beyond tragic. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight on behalf of Kentucky families and nursing home residents who have suffered pain and loss because of the negligent or abusive actions of nurses, doctors, staff and volunteers. If your loved one has been hurt, we may be able to help.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6364" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-695337976-1-300x132.jpg" alt="Doctors Continue to Practice After Repeated Malpractice Suits" width="300" height="132">The public often has a distorted idea of what happens when a doctor is charged with medical malpractice. A common assumption is that, if the charge is meritorious, the doctor will no longer practice medicine. Thus, when doctors continue to practice after one or more meritorious cases of malpractice, their patients are often rightfully concerned. In Kentucky and Ohio, the prevalence of medical professionals continuing to practice regardless of the number of cases against them, even if many have been settled, continues to grow. Many patients are none the wiser since the information is not required to be provided to patients.
<h2><strong><em>What happens after a malpractice suit?</em></strong></h2>
Depending on the disposition of the suit &#x2013; whether it went to trial and the doctor was found guilty or not, or whether it was settled out of court &#x2013; the outcome for the doctor could be very different. If the case went to trial and was dismissed, while there will still be a record of the accusation and charges, no action will be taken in terms of consequences. In cases that have been settled, or wherein the doctor was found liable, there is usually a financial payment to compensate the injured patient. This creates a permanent record of the charge. Depending on the severity, the doctor may lose his or her license to practice medicine in the state. However, the overwhelming majority of negligent doctors suffer no consequences other than their insurance premiums rising, due to a claim having been paid.

The penalties surrounding licensing are not decided by the court, but rather by the State Medical Board, which has considerable discretion about punitive measures. Even if a doctor admits to committing &#xA0;medical malpractice, he or she will not likely have any action taken against their license to practice medicine. Every case is unique.
<h2><strong><em>How to protect yourself and your family from dangerous doctors</em></strong></h2>
Unfortunately, the onus for checking whether your family doctor has been sued for malpractice, or settled such suits, is on you. While the state licensure board is responsible for disciplining or removing dangerous doctors from practice, many escape consequences. One Kentucky report for the years 1990-2002 found that only one quarter (<a href="https://www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/ky_medmal_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24%</a>) of doctors with five or more medical malpractice payouts were disciplined by the Board. However, the information for malpractice suits and settlements can often be obtained via the internet.

The Ohio State Medical Board does not directly address malpractice claims for the public, but licensing information is <a href="https://elicense.ohio.gov/OH_HomePage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>, provided you know the doctor&#x2019;s first and last name. In Kentucky, the same data is also freely accessible <a href="http://www.docinfo.org/#!/search/query" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>. For information about whether claims have been brought against your doctor in either Kentucky or Ohio, you can call the County Clerk&#x2019;s office directly, because these lawsuits are public record. Before seeing any new doctor, it is wise to check his or her licensing status and whether any legal action has been taken against him or her. The <a href="https://www.bbb.org/en/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better Business Bureau website</a> is another resource to check for issues.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our medical malpractice attorneys are here to be your voice when doctors fail in their required standard of care, for your or for a family member.

If a food in your fridge is recalled, you can check your receipt and the tracking information on the product itself to see if it is a concern. But what happens when your implanted hip replacement or pacemaker has an issue?

That is the basis of a new effort by consumer advocates who wish to know the serial numbers on medical implants. The laws exist already to move forward with <a href="http://www.startribune.com/effort-to-improve-tracking-of-medical-devices-divides-industry-consumer-groups/451942493/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unique device identifiers</a>, or UDIs &#x2013; but no one seems to know just how to start implementing those laws.
<h2><strong><em>Growing population, urgent need </em></strong></h2>
Implanted medical devices go far beyond joints and hearts, into nearly every category of medicine available, including:
<ul>
    <li>Sensory and brain implants, such as cochlear implants and neurostimulators</li>
    <li>Heart and circulatory implants, like stents, artificial hearts, and pacemakers</li>
    <li>Bone and joint implants, including pins, rods, plates, joints, and screws</li>
    <li>Contraceptive implants, both intrauterine and placed elsewhere in the body</li>
    <li>Cosmetic and prosthetic implants</li>
    <li>Urological implants, for issues such as bladder or fecal incontinence, including transvaginal mesh</li>
</ul>
According to the American Joint Replacement Registry, nearly <a href="https://www.odtmag.com/contents/view_online-exclusives/2016-12-12/american-joint-replacement-registry-releases-third-annual-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half a million joint replacement surgeries</a> alone were done in the US between 2012 and 2015. The number of Americans walking around with an unregistered, untraceable, and potentially defective medical implant or device is staggering.<strong><em>&#xA0;</em></strong>
<h2><strong><em>Consumer protection and accountability</em></strong></h2>
If automotive dealers can implement infrastructure, paperwork, and fees associated with VIN&#x2019;s, then it seems entirely feasible for the healthcare and insurance industries to do the same. The problem, however, is twofold: first patient privacy laws, to start, may prohibit the transmission of information about patients to manufactures. This means the collection work would have to be done by someone else.

Manufacturers do support a detailed data collection record. The Executive Vice President of device manufacturer AdvaMed, a man named Don May, told the <em>Star Tribune</em> &quot;We support the collection of the UDI in the electronic health record, where it can actually be used to really help track patient outcomes and be used in a more proactive way around postmarket surveillance. If we are really concerned about patient safety, then let&apos;s go to the tool that makes the most sense.&quot;

This leads us to point number two: the &#x201C;someone else&#x201D; in charge of data collection &#x2013; Medicare. This will be a time-consuming and costly process, and Medicare may not be sufficient for the task. The funds will need to come from somewhere, but this federal program may not be able to supply them.

The best possible outcome for patients would be a threefold responsibility process. Manufacturers of all medical devices need to use the same format and issue alerts through a nationwide system accessible to both medical professionals and individuals; doctors and healthcare facilities practitioners need to conscientiously track patients&#x2019; implants throughout their lives; and insurance companies need to assist in maintaining accurate patient contact records for each implant.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our defective medical device attorneys make sure your voice is heard when health care companies sell dangerous products.&#xA0; If you need considerate, yet tenacious legal representation, please contact our Ohio lawyers at 877-686-8879, our Kentucky attorneys at 877-686-8879, or use our <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact form</a> to make an appointment.

The severity of spina bifida varies from case to case, but it involves the tissue of the spinal cord failing to fully close, leading to issues with mobility, bladder and bowel issues, and hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in the brain).

Surgeons have been exploring fetal surgery for spina bifida for over 20 years to reduce the severity of the defect, as spinal column exposure to amniotic fluid exacerbates the damage. The risk of early delivery as a result has always been present, but a new surgical technique, including the use of a fiber optic fetoscope, is making it possible to operate earlier, preserving more spinal cord functionality and leading to better outcomes for children and families. However, future risks remain for mothers who have undergone these procedures.
<h2><strong><em>Surgery before birth</em></strong></h2>
Beginning in the 1990s, medical professionals developed the open procedure, wherein the uterus is lifted out of the mother&#x2019;s abdomen, cut, and then surgery is performed on the fetus, before it is returned to the uterus, which is then mechanically shut and returned to the mother&#x2019;s abdomen. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/fetal-surgery-spina-bifida.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new surgical procedure</a> still involves removing the uterus from the mother&#x2019;s abdomen; however, at that point instead of making one or more large cuts, a device called a fetoscope is used through one small incision and tools through a second small incision. These fewer, smaller wounds are less injurious to the uterus,&#xA0; not unlike the way laparoscopic tools reduce recovery time for joint and other surgeries. Additionally, the use of a fetoscope allows mothers to carry their pregnancies closer to full-term than the former open procedure allowed.

One other notable difference between the open and fetoscopic procedures is how the surgeons inflate and reflate the uterus. In the open version, amniotic fluid is saved and replaced at the end of the surgery. In the fetoscopic version, the amniotic fluid is drained, the uterus is inflated with carbon dioxide during the procedure to give doctors the best visualization of the spina bifida defect as they repair it, and then the uterus is refilled with saline solution. There is some concern that carbon dioxide could lead to neurological issues after delivery, but no consensus has been reached on the issue.
<h2><strong><em>Risks to mother and infant</em></strong></h2>
Any pre-birth surgery carries the danger of inducing labor; therefore, surgeons only perform the surgery on fetuses who have passed the point of viability, around 500 grams or 24 weeks gestational age. The perils of &#x201C;uncomplicated&#x201D; <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/labor/dealing-with-preterm-labor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preterm birth</a> for underage or underweight infants vary, but can lead to physical and mental disabilities, or even death. Birth injuries are also possible, due to the undeveloped musculoskeletal system of the infants involved. Threats are also present for mothers who undergo these procedures, regardless of the fetal outcome. Spina bifida pre-birth surgeries that involve fully cutting into the uterus can lead to uterine scarring, which in turn increases the incidence of cesarean section births for future pregnancies. When surgical errors occur, the outcomes can be dire for mothers and potentially impact their future fertility.

Elon Musk&#x2019;s Tesla company has developed a rig that can travel <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/11/17/teslas-latest-creation-an-electric-big-rig-that-can-travel-500-miles-on-a-single-charge/?utm_term=.8aedcf39877f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500 miles on just one single charge</a>. The announcement is a follow-up to Tesla&#x2019;s difficulties in developing Tesla 3, which was intended to be a mass-market electric sedan. Musk&#x2019;s bold claims have the industry talking about the future of trucking and the safety of these semi-trucks.

Musk makes quite a few claims about the new vehicles, including:
<ul>
    <li>The ride is so smooth that truck drivers will feel like they are driving a racecar.</li>
    <li>The computer display panels make it so easy to operate that non-truck drivers can drive it smoothly.</li>
    <li>The new truck does not produce any emissions, which makes it environmentally friendly.</li>
    <li>The newly designed big rigs perform as well or better than a diesel engine, at a much better price than current rigs.</li>
    <li>The trucks can go 500 miles on just one battery charge, and travel 60 mph during that trip. Musk claims that since the average semi-rig trip is less than 250 miles, a truck should be able to make two trips on a single charge.</li>
    <li>The trucks can charge during a driver&#x2019;s 30-minute break or while the inventory is being unloaded.</li>
    <li>The trucks will need little maintenance because they do not have transmissions or gears and have four motors. Musk made the bold claim that his company&#x2019;s new trucks should be able to travel a million miles without breaking down.</li>
    <li>The autopilot standard should improve safety.</li>
</ul>
Walmart has already announced it will buy fifteen of the new Tesla trucks, and other trucking companies are getting on board as well. However, many in the trucking industry are skeptical about Musk&#x2019;s ability to deliver on these claims. The failure of the sedan electric model has made potential buyers hesitant to order the new trucks.
<h2>Who is liable in a collision with a Tesla truck?</h2>
Right now, if you are in a collision with a traditional commercial vehicle, you have a few options for recovering damages: you can make a claim against the manufacturer of the truck (if there is a defective part); you can make a claim against the driver; and/or you can make a claim against the trucking company or employer. When Tracy Morgan was hit by a Wal-Mart truck a few years ago, he sued Wal-Mart. (The driver himself faced criminal charges.)

But if one of these trucks is involved in a collision, whose fault is it? If there is a defect in the truck or its software, then Tesla could be held liable. If the truck is not properly maintained, then it might fall to the companies which buy the trucks. Furthermore, the idea that it is so easy to drive that even a non-CDL licensed driver could handle it is also a bit worrying. You have to pass a specific test to driver a tractor-trailer, and undergo training to learn how to maneuver these giant vehicles on the road. All the touch screens in the world won&#x2019;t help if the driver doesn&#x2019;t understand the importance of cargo load weight, or if he or she becomes distracted.

Finally, there is the issue of the autopilot feature. While some people herald driverless vehicles as the safer alternative, we&#x2019;re not so sure. After all, &#x201C;Tesla&#x2019;s &#x2018;Autopilot&#x2019; system [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][in its cars] is designed to perform limited tasks.... However, the system is meant to augment, not replace the driver. The vehicle&#x2019;s human driver and his overreliance on the system were at fault [for a crash in 2016], the NTSB concluded,&#x201D; per the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/how-safe-is-safe-enough-to-put-driverless-cars-on-the-nations-roadways/2017/12/10/9a1aa348-d519-11e7-b62d-d9345ced896d_story.html?utm_term=.66b2c99263f7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Washington Post</em></a>. If a truck driver feels he or she doesn&#x2019;t need to pay as close attention, because the autopilot is in control, there could be more accidents, not fewer &#x2013; and then the battle begins as to who will be held accountable for the injuries you sustained.

It&#x2019;s not that Tesla&#x2019;s invention isn&#x2019;t extraordinary, or that we oppose driverless vehicles in theory; we just want to make sure the laws are equipped to handle these new types of claims. Legal battles over who is liable just stretch out the amount of time it takes for an injury victim to receive his or her compensation &#x2013; time that he or she might not have. Our first priority is always to those who need it, no matter what happens.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our Kentucky truck accident lawyers are committed to helping victims of truck driving accidents and the families of deceased victims get justice. We will hold manufacturers liable if their trucks are defective and have caused physical and emotional harm.

The driver of the truck, according to the Hamilton Police department, did not have a valid operator&#x2019;s license. Investigators believe that the truck was going 65-mph in a 35-mph zone, and that failure of the brakes to work properly appears to have contributed to the truck crash.

The 58-year old woman who was killed in the accident was a hospital nurse who left behind a husband, two sons and two grandchildren.
<h2>Liability for this accident</h2>
Who is liable in this case depends on a full investigation and an examination of the truck&#x2019;s braking systems. The possible defendants include:
<ul>
    <li>The driver, due to the fact that he was speeding and failed to have control of the truck.</li>
    <li>The trucking company, if they were aware that the operator&#x2019;s license was suspended or failed to inquire about the license.</li>
    <li>The manufacturer of the brakes, if the brakes were defective and their failure caused the accident.</li>
</ul>
The husband and sons of the woman can claim wrongful death damages against the responsible parties. The parents of the woman could also demand damages. Wrongful death damages include the funeral and hospital bills, as well as the loss of financial and emotional support the woman would have provided each family member. They also include the pain and anguish of the family members, the loss of guidance and care she would have given her loved ones, and any likely inheritances.

In addition, experienced Ohio truck accident lawyers will likely claim that the driver should pay punitive damages due to the fact that his license was suspended. If the trucking company was aware of the license suspension, they may also be responsible for punitive damages.

If you were injured in a truck accident or a loved one was tragically killed, the experienced Ohio truck crash lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help.

On December 18<sup>th</sup>, An Amtrak train, traveling from Seattle to Portland, derailed in DuPont, Washington. Thirteen cars jumped the tracks, several of which fell over the side of an overpass and onto the highway below, damaging five different vehicles. Around 100 people sustained injuries, and three fatalities have been reported thus far.

The Amtrak Cascades 501 train was traveling about 80 mph when it came into the turn &#x2013; an eerily similar scenario to the 2015 Amtrak 188 crash in Philadelphia. That derailment left eight people dead.

The initial shock of the derailment is still being processed, and the injured may still be tending to their wounds. The families of the victims may be in the midst of planning funerals. The entire situation is awful &#x2013; and entirely preventable.
<h2>Failure to uphold the laws left three people dead</h2>
In 2008, a head-on train crash in California killed 25 people. In response to the tragedy, Congress mandated that all passenger railroads implement positive train control (PTC) safety systems by <a href="https://www.fra.dot.gov/ptc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 31, 2015</a>. PTC, in brief, can slow down a speeding train automatically, if it senses that the train is moving too quickly. Had it been implemented the way the law required, Amtrak 501 would not have been able to hit a 30 mph curve at 80 mph; it would have automatically slowed down, to take the curve at a safer speed.

Instead, Congress kotowed to the railroads, extending the deadlines. As one <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-survived-an-amtrak-crash-this-weeks-victims-are-in-for-a-rude-awakening/2017/12/20/b0e9af4e-e5a7-11e7-a65d-1ac0fd7f097e_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-b%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.e2aaea9cd97e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survivor of the Philadelphia crash</a> explained in an op-ed for the Washington Post, &#x201C;Railroads complained about the costs and threatened not to run their trains unless Congress pushed the deadline to 2018. Congress caved completely, allowing railroads to defer PTC without penalty. Congress even allowed an additional loophole: If railroads &#x2018;showed progress,&#x2019; they didn&#x2019;t have to start using PTC until 2020.&#x201D;

Amtrak has installed PTC systems in its Northeast corridor, which runs from Boston to DC, but not on other commuter rail lines. The delay, in part, is caused by who uses the lines. Amtrak travels on some of the same rail lines as freighter trains &#x2013; and freight rail companies, as the <em>New York Times</em> explains, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/us/amtrak-train-safety.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don&#x2019;t necessarily see the benefit in installing the systems.</a> (It is also safe to assume they would prefer not to have to pay for any costs associated with it, either.)

Furthermore, the rails themselves are owned by different regional transit authorities. When the Times tried to get a full answer from Sound Transit (which owns the track Amtrak 501 was traveling), the reporters were referred to Amtrak and Washington&#x2019;s Department of Transportation. When the reporters called Amtrak, they were told to call Sound Transit. No one wants to take accountability for yet another deadly-but-preventable crash.
<h2>Adding insult to literal injury</h2>
There is another problem for victims of the crash, as well. In 1997, Congress decided that all Amtrak claims would be capped at $200 million. That number was revised in 2015, to $295 million, after the Philadelphia derailment &#x2013; but as the writer for the Post explained:

&#x201C;that was far from sufficient to compensate the eight families who lost loved ones and the 200 passengers who suffered life-changing injuries. Amtrak ended up paying only a fraction of the damage it had inflicted. The victims ended up bearing a large part of their own medical costs and lost wages. Meanwhile, Amtrak&#x2019;s chief executive &#x2014; who ran what the NTSB described as a railroad lacking a &#x2018;safety culture&#x2019; for eight years &#x2014; retired without so much as a slap on the wrist.&#x201D;

It is no longer enough to pass legislation; our Congress must fully enforce it, and force the railroads to implement the federally-mandated safety systems. Amtrak cannot be allowed to continue in its current path, putting its own profits ahead of the safety of its passengers. No matter who is responsible for paying for the PCT systems, this latest loss of life falls squarely on Amtrak&#x2019;s shoulders.

In 2016, the police department started using a predictive algorithm when screening incoming calls of reported child abuse or neglect. They are the first in the country to use the system as a back-up to human screeners &#x2013; a second opinion, as the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> puts it &#x2013; to determine whether or not a child is at high-risk of being injured, abused or neglected in the future.

From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/magazine/can-an-algorithm-tell-when-kids-are-in-danger.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Times Magazine</em></a>:

&#x201C;Nationally, 42 percent of the four million allegations received in 2015, involving 7.2 million children, were screened out, often based on sound legal reasoning but also because of judgment calls, opinions, biases and beliefs. And yet more United States children died in 2015 as a result of abuse and neglect &#x2014; 1,670, according to the federal Administration for Children and Families; or twice that many, according to leaders in the field &#x2014; than died of cancer.&#x201D;

There are approximately 14,000 allegations made in Allegheny County each year. About 7,000 of them are screened out. What the predictive algorithm does is help the department of Children, Youth and Families (CYF) which calls warrant closer inspection. The algorithm does <em>not</em> decide whether or not children are pulled from the home. Instead, it identifies the children at the most risk of danger; CYF then determines whether or not to pursue the allegations further.
<h2>How does the program work?</h2>
The algorithm is designed to find patterns. Every single police department in the country (not just Allegheny County) has files on record for allegations of child abuse or neglect. It would take human screeners hours &#x2013; maybe days &#x2013; to comb through them all. Instead, the algorithm looks at all the data at once, &#x201C;using well over 100 criteria maintained in eight databases for jails, psychiatric services, public-welfare benefits, drug and alcohol treatment centers and more.&#x201D;

The exact process is proprietary, but ultimately, the program reviews the data and renders its analysis based on that data. It provides a number on a scale of one (safe) to 20 (high risk). Screeners report that number, and then CYF decides about whether or not to investigate.
<h2>Does the algorithm work?</h2>
Yes. Yes, it does.

Before the implementation of the program, about half of the cases Allegheny County investigated were considered low risk. This ate up valuable time that that CYF could have spent working with children who were in more serious, and more immediate, danger. Over the last 18 months, the percentage of low-risk cases dropped from half to a third.

But even more important, the number of high-risk cases been screened into the system increased. The <em>Times</em> admits that the number only went up by a few percentage points &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s still progress.

There is one other benefit to using the program, too. It doesn&#x2019;t fall prey to racial bias:

&#x201C;In 2015, black children accounted for 38 percent of all calls to Allegheny County&#x2019;s maltreatment hotline, double the rate that would be expected based on their population. Their rate of being placed outside their home because of maltreatment was even more disproportionate: eight out of every 1,000 black children residing in the county were placed outside their home that year, compared with just 1.7 of every 1,000 white children.&#x201D;

The algorithm is helping to reduce that bias. True, it may have more data available if more allegations are reported in regard to black families &#x2013; but because race isn&#x2019;t a factor in the program&#x2019;s analysis, it has actually limited the effects of bias.

As more and more states get onboard with the program, we can only hope they will consider bringing it here. According to the Child Welfare League of America, <a href="http://www.cwla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/OHIO.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio had 172,445 child neglect referrals</a> in 2015. Of those referrals:
<ul>
    <li>79,215 reports were referred for investigation</li>
    <li>23,006 were victims of neglect (44%), physical abuse (44.3%) and sexual abuse (20.4%)</li>
    <li>74 children died</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://www.cwla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/KENTUCKY-revised-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky had fewer referrals &#x2013; 101,094</a> &#x2013; than Ohio, but a higher percentage of those cases (55,209) were investigated. CWLA found a &#x201C;rate of 18.7 per 1,000 children&#x201D; were victims of neglect (92.2%), physical abuse (8.3%) and sexual abuse (4.8%). Sixteen of the children died.

The algorithm may not predict which children are in immediate danger, but by finding a pattern, it can help reduce (and perhaps even eradicate) future abuses. And anything that helps protect kids seems like a good idea to us.

Particularly if you have struggled to become or stay pregnant, the risks are all too real. Recently, a <em>Journal of American Medicine</em> study linked common <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2659557" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pesticides used on fruits and vegetables</a> to problematic reproductive assistance outcomes. When the birth process goes awry, interventions are needed, and can sometimes lead to birth injuries at the hands of well-intentioned but unskilled medical professionals.
<h2><strong><em>High pesticide consumption linked with unsuccessful pregnancies</em></strong></h2>
The JAMA study was not focused on any one particular pesticide or chemical. Instead, the emphasis was on pesticide residue, from unwashed or incompletely washed fruits and vegetables, and whether a high rate of consumption had any impact on the live birth rate. No mothers were told <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/beginning-stages/keeping-yourself-and-your-baby-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what to eat or what not to eat</a>; instead, scientists measured the average intake of pesticide residue based on what the women reported eating. All the mothers were clients at a fertility center at a teaching hospital.

Scientists already knew that excessive pesticide intake in animals seemed to correlate to lower live birth rate, but were unsure of whether such a connection was true for humans, and particularly for women who had become pregnant using reproductive assistance or technology. The results suggested that women who had the highest average ingestion of pesticide residue had an 18% lower probability of becoming pregnant, and a 26% lower chance of having a live birth. It is important to note that all the women in the study ate levels of pesticide residue that were within the range of typical human exposure.
<h2><strong><em>Common sense and good nutrition</em></strong></h2>
Does this mean pregnant women should forego all fruits and vegetables? Clearly not. While organic foods may vary in terms of specific production and pesticide exposure, they are usually lower in pesticide residue than food not labeled as organic. Avoiding all fresh produce could have more significant negative results for your baby.
<ul>
    <li>Infants who lack <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/2017/08/baby-needs-vitamin-k-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vitamin K</a> can have trouble clotting, and vitamin K is typically found in green, leafy vegetables.</li>
    <li>Folate is a B vitamin which protects babies from neural tube defects like spina bifida, and can be found in fruits; green, leafy vegetables; enriched grain-based products; and legumes.</li>
    <li>Calcium to builds a baby&#x2019;s bones during a mother&#x2019;s pregnancy. If she is not consuming enough calcium in her diet, her body will steal calcium from her own bones to make her baby strong, leaving her prone to osteoporosis as she ages. Calcium is ingested through dairy products, dark green leafy vegetables, and fortified foods.</li>

Even women who are just considering becoming pregnant should consume a balanced diet, including a multi-vitamin if a doctor thinks it is necessary. Birth injuries can result from doctors&#x2019; failure to note nutritional deficiencies in mothers and infants, possibly leading to permanent results, disabilities, or death. Consuming a diet that is nutrient-balanced and low in pesticides does not just improve the chances for women to become and stay pregnant, it allows any person to lead a full and healthy life.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our birth injury attorneys work diligently to make your needs, and the voice of your child and family, heard.&#xA0; If you are seeking an empathetic, adamant legal representative, please contact our Kentucky lawyers at 877-686-8879, our Ohio team at 877-686-8879, or use our <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact form</a> to make an appointment.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6428" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-92651120-300x223.jpg" alt="People Are Leaving Ohio and Kentucky in Droves &#x2013; But Why?" width="300" height="223">Every year, United Van Lines releases its list of which states saw the most inbound and outbound moves. Illinois topped the list of people moving away (643% of all moves were outbound), and Vermont topped the list of people moving in (68% of all moves were inbound). Overall, it seems people are moving more west or further south.

Ohio and Kentucky both made the list for outbound moves, with <a href="https://www.unitedvanlines.com/contact-united/news/movers-study-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> place</a>, respectively. But why? According to United Van Lines, the top 5 reasons included:
<ul>
    <li>Jobs located outside of the state (65% in Ohio, 54% in Kentucky)</li>
    <li>Retirement (19.2% in Ohio and in Kentucky)</li>
    <li>Relocation for family (13.9% in Ohio, 25.7% in Kentucky)</li>
    <li>Lifestyle changes (6.6% in Ohio, 7.9% in Kentucky)</li>
    <li>Health reasons (3.8% in Ohio, 4.5% in Kentucky)</li>
</ul>
Most of Ohio&#x2019;s outbound population was age 34 or younger, whereas Kentucky saw the highest spike for people over the age of 65. In both states, households with an average annual income of $150,000 were the most likely to leave.

The fact that high-income households &#x2013; and young people &#x2013; are leaving both states should be worrying. Aging states with lower incomes often demand more assistance from state and federal governments, which can increase taxes and slow down development. As it turns out, though, our neighbors are fining some pretty ingenious ways to increase revenue, and make Ohio and Kentucky look more attractive to outsiders.

Appalachian tourism.
<h2>A new way of experiencing &#x201C;coal country&#x201D;</h2>
The San Francisco Chronicle recently reported on the ways Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia have been reinventing themselves, both as <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Tourism-in-coal-country-Digging-into-culture-12455595.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tourist destinations and as cultural centers</a>: &#x201C;A Shawnee, Ohio, event re-enacted a Prohibition rally outside the real-life former speakeasy.... Ohio&apos;s Winding Road takes visitors back to the birth of the U.S. labor movement.&#x201D; Ohio has also seen a pickup in <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/travel/index.ssf/2017/12/ohio_sees_increase_in_overseas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international tourism</a>. Cleveland now has two flights directly to and from Iceland, and Great Lakes USA has worked with international students and travelers seeking a more &#x201C;authentic&#x201D; American experience.

While Ohio has sought to create new opportunities in and around its towns &#x2013; the Chronicle writer called it &#x201C;Rust Belt Chic&#x201D; &#x2013; Kentucky has largely focused on ecotourism. &#x201C;In Corbin, Kentucky, they&apos;re constructing an elk-viewing area on a former mountaintop mine,&#x201D; as well as an &#x201C;ecology education site.&#x201D; The goal is to bring in and educate tourists and wildlife enthusiasts, who can see how changes in the mountain top&#x2019;s structure has created an ideal habitat for elk, deer, bear and birds. In Eastern Kentucky, the <a href="http://www.moreheadtourism.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;More to Morehead&#x201D; campaign</a> has helped generate enough income to make Rowan County the 5<sup>th</sup> most visited area of Appalachia. Visitors can explore the lake and the local woods, but also pop in for a cup of coffee or shop at the boutiques downtown.
<h2>Why tourism matters to all of us</h2>
As anyone who lives in a tourist destination can tell you, visitors help the local economy. They generate revenue, increase the need for workers, and help lower residents&#x2019; annual tax bill. All of this helps local and state governments fund social programs, fix crumbling infrastructure, and create new spaces to be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. It&#x2019;s a win/win.

But there is another benefit to this influx of revenue outside of taxes: health. United Van Lines listed health reasons in last place for both Ohio and Kentucky &#x2013; and it&#x2019;s no wonder. Coal Country has long had a reputation for poor water supplies, dirty air and touch soil (despite evidence to the contrary for that last one). More revenue means better clean-up, and better healthcare, too. Local clinics and hospitals often see a share of that revenue, which means they can increase their reach. Rural areas have been especially hard-hit when it comes to <a href="https://www.patientsrightsblog.com/federal-demands-doctors-hospitals-may-prove-unreasonable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access to care</a>. The more revenue our states being in, the better chance at increasing that access.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we do more than serve the community in Ohio and Kentucky. We live here. We raised our children here. We have a vested interest in the success of our communities, and look forward to seeing all the ways life can improve here.

Our firm offers comprehensive representation to residents and visitors alike.

Takata&#x2019;s defective airbags accounted for much of that total, but almost every major automaker faced a recall that year. As of December 20<sup>th</sup>, however, 2017 had seen its fair share of recalls, too: <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/big-and-noteworthy-auto-recalls-of-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28,146,661 recalled vehicles</a>, to be exact. It falls far short of the 52,985,779 vehicles recalled in 2016, but it&#x2019;s still a large enough number to warrant closer inspection.

According to Road Show, these were the automakers who saw the greatest numbers of recalls in 2017:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Fiat Chrysler: 3,939,250 vehicles recalled</strong>. Dodge faced problems with their rollover technology (mostly in Rams) and for defective oil cooler lines, which increased the chance of a fire.</li>
    <li><strong>Honda: 3,319,327 vehicles recalled</strong>. Accords in particular had a defect which could lead to car fires, and their Odysseys&#x2019; second row of seats did not always latch correctly. If the driver braked too hard, or was hit by another car, the seats themselves could come loose.</li>
    <li><strong>Ford: total number unknown</strong>. There were more than a million F-Series trucks recalled, though, for a defect that could lead to the doors appearing closed, even though they were open.</li>
    <li><strong>Hyundai: 1,549,778 vehicles recalled</strong>. Seat belts detaching (Sonata) and potential manufacturer mistakes in the engines (Santa Fe) were the primary reasons for recalls.</li>
    <li><strong>BMW: total number unknown</strong>. The 3 Series models were recalled because the engine could short circuit, whereas the i3 electric cars put drivers at risk of a serious neck injury. Of all the recalls last year, the i3 recalls are the only ones without a fix or patch.</li>
    <li><strong>Tesla: 31,472 recalled vehicles</strong>. Model S vehicles have a parking break problem (they don&#x2019;t release). Model X vehicles were recalled for the brake problem as well as an issue with seat cable, which could send the rear passenger seat behind the driver crashing into the driver in a collision.</li>
</ol>
<h2>My vehicle was recalled. What do I do?</h2>
If you, like millions of other drivers, find yourself with a car or truck that has been recalled, don&#x2019;t panic. Many recalls deal with issues that are not life-threatening. (<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/what-to-do-if-your-car-gets-recalled/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A misplaced sticker could lead to a recall</a>.) You should receive an email or a letter in the mail from the dealership or the manufacturer. If you think your car or truck is part of a recall, but you have not been notified &#x2013; or if you are just curious &#x2013; you can enter your vehicle identification number (VIN) at <a href="https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/owners/SearchSafetyIssues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaferCar.gov and search for it directly</a>.

It costs you nothing to fix or replace a defective part. If the dealership tries to charge you, contact the manufacture. If that doesn&#x2019;t work, <a href="https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/recalls/recallproblems.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.

The next thing you do is call your local dealership and make an appointment to have the defect or faulty part fixed or replaced. <strong>Tire recalls must be handled within 60 days of receiving the notice<em>.</em></strong> Other issues can be handled as they arise &#x2013; but this is problematic, too. For example, Takata is stull churning out replacement airbags, and will be for years. If the dealership doesn&#x2019;t have the part, there is nothing you can do until the parts are ready, short of calling other dealerships to see if they have some in stock. You should also know that used car dealerships are under no obligation to replace recalled parts before they sell you the car, so make sure to run the vehicle through the VIN finder on the NHTSA website to see if the car has any potential issues.

If you were injured in a car or truck accident because of a defective part, you have legal options available to you. Crandall &amp; Pera Law protects the rights of car and truck crash victims throughout Kentucky and Ohio.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6431" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-510849538-300x197.jpg" alt="Reusing Catheters Put Some NJ Patients in &#x201C;Clear and Imminent Danger&#x201D;" width="300" height="197">Catheters are useful little tools. They&#x2019;re small plastic tools used by medical professionals for an array of reasons: to measure, to drain, to give drugs, etc. They&#x2019;re also disposable &#x2013; on purpose. After all, do you really want a tube that has been in someone else&#x2019;s stomach placed into your own?

Yet reuse is exactly what one New Jersey doctor did. &#x201C;Dr. Sanjiv K. Patankar, an East Brunswick-based colon and rectal surgeon, allegedly washed and reused the small, flexible catheters that are &#x2018;inserted into patients&apos; rectums during medical procedures,&#x2019;&quot; according to NJ.com. The news site reports that <a href="http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2017/12/nj_doctors_license_suspended_for_allegedly_reusing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">82 procedures were conducted</a> in Dr. Patankar&#x2019;s office over the course of 11 months (from January 1<sup>st</sup> through November 30<sup>th</sup>).

The total number of catheters ordered during that time? <strong>Five</strong>.

The state Board of Medical Examiners ruled unanimously that Dr. Patankar&#x2019;s actions &#x201C;placed patients in clear and immediate danger,&#x201D; and suspended his license as a result. A full hearing will be conducted, after which the Board will make a final ruling about how to proceed.
<h2>Suspending his license seems like an obvious choice &#x2013; but it isn&#x2019;t always that way</h2>
In this particular case, a temporary (and preferably full) revocation of Dr. Patankar&#x2019;s license seems like a no-brainer. After all, simply washing a catheter does not make it sterile. What reusing catheters did was make it easier to spread infections.

You might be surprised, then, at how often obviously negligent or abusive doctors, surgeons and other medical personnel are given no more than a pat on the wrist, or a fine, <a href="https://www.patientsrightsblog.com/national-practitioner-data-bank-reports-for-ohio-and-kentucky-reveal-critical-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite critical errors</a>. A 2013 expose by USA TODAY uncovered thousands of cases where doctors lost their privileges at facilities, yet were <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/20/doctors-licenses-medical-boards/2655513/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed to keep their medical licenses</a>:

&#x201C;Even the most severe misconduct goes unpunished: Nearly 250 of the doctors sanctioned by health care institutions were cited as an &#x2018;immediate threat to health and safety,&#x2019; yet their licenses still were not restricted or taken away. About 900 were cited for substandard care, negligence, incompetence or malpractice &#x2014; and kept practicing with no licensure action.&#x201D;

Most recently, and closest to home, is the story of a Cleveland Clinic surgeon who was allowed to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/05/confidential-deals-can-obscure-sexual-misconduct-allegations-against-doctors-alleged-rape-doctors/868921001/?csp=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue practicing medicine despite rape accusations</a> from two former patients. If this is not a stellar example of how often accusations of wrongdoing are covered up &#x2013; or ignored &#x2013; by hospitals, we don&#x2019;t know what is.
<h2>Adverse actions on Ohio and Kentucky patients</h2>
For healthcare consumers, trying to find out whether your doctor is negligent or abusive can be challenging. The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) keeps a running tally of how many adverse actions are reported each year in each state, and how many medical malpractice claims are actually paid out. Here are the 2016 numbers:

<a href="https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/npdbstats/npdbStatistics.jsp#ContentTop">Ohio</a>
<ul>
    <li>2,283 adverse action reports
<ul>
    <li>2,088 required state licensure &#x201C;actions&#x201D;</li>
    <li>28 involved clinical privilege and panel membership</li>
    <li>4 involved professional society membership</li>
    <li>12 involved drug enforcement administration</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>216 malpractice payments were made</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/npdbstats/npdbStatistics.jsp#ContentTop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky</a>
<ul>
    <li>888 adverse action reports
<ul>
    <li>779 required state licensure &#x201C;actions&#x201D;</li>
    <li>8 involved clinical privilege and panel membership</li>
    <li>9 involved drug enforcement administration</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>118 malpractice payments were made</li>
</ul>
(For more in-depth definitions of these terms, please see the NPDB&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/definitions.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Definitions and Terms</a>.)

It&#x2019;s a good thing that the NJ Board is choosing to act. We wish it were a more common response to flagrant acts of negligence and to errors. Perhaps then, we would have a safer and more secure health system.

In early January, South Central Judicial District Judge Cynthia Feland ruled that the state&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.law360.com/medical-malpractice/articles/1000538/nd-s-med-mal-damages-cap-is-unconstitutional-judge-rules?nl_pk=bcf11761-fedd-45cb-8109-9658779bd2e1&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=medical-malpractice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arbitrary damage cap</a> on medical malpractice verdicts was unconstitutional, &#x201C;saying it deprives the most catastrophically injured patients of full compensation and thus denies them equal protection of the laws.&#x201D; This is a victory for the people of North Dakota, and another legal precedent for those of us around the country who have been striving to end dangerous tort reform practices for years.
<h2>What did the judge do?</h2>
Last April, a woman named Chenille Condon won her trial against a Dr. Allen Michael Booth and his employer, St. Alexius Medical Center. The jury found for Ms. Condon after the doctor&#x2019;s negligence during an exploratory procedure led to her stroke, paralysis and blurred vision. The jury verdict for Ms. Condon was $3.5 million: $2 million for her economic damages and $1.5 million for past and future non-economic damages.

However, North Dakota enacted a law in 1995, capping non-economic damages at $500,000. The lawyers for Dr. Booth and St. Alexius requested that the amount be lowered, given that law.
<h2>Why did the judge strike down the defendant&#x2019;s request?</h2>
Under the 1995 North Dakota law, the reason the $500,000 cap was enacted was threefold: &#x201C;to increase access to health care, control medical expenses and maintain or increase the quality of health care.&#x201D; The amount of the cap was, as are all damage cap amounts, entirely arbitrary.

However, as Judge Feland pointed out, limiting the jury&#x2019;s verdict contributed in no way to upholding these factors. Let&#x2019;s break them down:
<ol>
    <li>It would not increase her access to care. In fact, given how expensive healthcare is, and how much hospitals stays can cost, it could actually cause her harm. And there is no evidence it has helped other people access healthcare, either.</li>
    <li>Limiting the amount of the verdict would do nothing to help control medical expenses. The mistake had already been made and she needs future care. Furthermore, <a href="http://truecostofhealthcare.org/malpractice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is plenty of evidence</a> that doctors across the country are not struggling to obtain or pay for medical malpractice insurance. Thus, there is no need to increase medical costs.</li>
    <li>Limiting the verdict did not decrease anyone&#x2019;s costs. Remember, the jury awarded Ms. Condon <em>more </em>money to pay for her medical bills than it did for her noneconomic losses, and there are no caps on that amount at all.</li>
    <li>Limiting the verdict did nothing to increase the quality of healthcare. Holding doctors responsible for only a fraction of the harm they cause does not incentivize practicing safer medicine.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why a decision in North Dakota should matter in Ohio and Kentucky</h2>
At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we have been waging our own battles against tort reform in the states where we live and practice law. Ohio&#x2019;s medical malpractice cap is $250,000 or three times the compensatory damages amount, with a maximum of $350,000 per plaintiff or $500,000 per incident. In instances where the victim has a permanent and substantial physical deformity or loss of bodily organ system, that cap rises to $500,000 per plaintiff or $1 million per incident.&#xA0; Kentucky doesn&#x2019;t have damage caps, but tort reform is here as well: we narrowly avoided having our rights denied by medical review panels, but they have currently been deemed unconstitutional.

As more and more courts come down on the right side of justice, the better we are able to uphold the rights of our clients. North Dakota has joined in the fight for what is right, and we are thrilled about it.

In the simplest of terms, it involves drilling down into the ground (eventually making an &#x201C;L&#x201D; and drilling horizontally) to reach the natural gas trapped below the shale. Water, sand and chemicals, including nitrogen, are then pumped into the ground. This cracks the shale and allows the gas to either rise up, or to be extracted.

Both Ohio and Kentucky have plenty of natural gas reserves, and so fracking has become an increasingly larger part of our collective economies. The arguments for and against the controversial process are myriad, but we want to focus on one in particular: namely, that babies born within a 2-mile radius (give or take) of fracking sites <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/12/e1603021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routinely have lower birthweights</a> than those who are not.

A new piece published in the journal <em>Science Advances</em> evaluated <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/12/e1603021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.1 million births in Pennsylvania</a>, between 2004 and 2013. According to their findings:

&#x201C;[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][There is] evidence for negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3 km of a mother&#x2019;s residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts include a greater incidence of low&#x2013;birth weight babies as well as significant declines in average birth weight and in several other measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking are highly local.&#x201D;

<a href="https://earther.com/something-else-to-avoid-when-you-re-pregnant-fracking-1821264078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earther looked into these claims</a>, and found that the primary cause for these lower birth rates is likely pollution. They quote a press release co-authored by Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs Janet M. Currie as saying, &#x201C;Given the growing evidence that pollution affects babies in utero, it should not be surprising that fracking, which is a heavy industrial activity, has negative effects on infants.&#x201D;
<h2>Why low birthweights are dangerous for babies</h2>
Low birthweight is used to describe babies who weigh 5.5lbs or less at the time of their birth. There are some <a href="http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=low-birthweight-90-P02382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immediate concerns for babies who weigh too little</a>, per the Lucile Packard Children&#x2019;s Hospital in Stanford. Babies with low birthweights can have difficulties gaining weight. The may also experience respiratory distress, have difficulties regulating their own body temperatures, and are more prone to infection.

Low birthweight has also been linked to developmental issues. Because the fetus, and then the baby, can have difficulty getting enough oxygen, children with lower birthweights can develop neurological problems as well, and may have bleeding in the brain. Low birthweights have also been linked to sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS.
<h2>Lower birthweight can lead to health problems later in life</h2>
According to the March of Dimes, <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/low-birthweight.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 1 in 12 children are born with low birthweight</a>. While many children born with low birthweights grow up to be healthy, there are some risks associated with the condition later on, including increased chances of:
<ul>
    <li>Heart disease</li>
    <li>High blood pressure</li>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>Metabolic syndrome (a combination of all three conditions listed above)</li>
    <li>Obesity</li>
</ul>
We urge you, if you live in an industrial area (whether this is fracking or not) to make and attend regular appointments with your OB/GYN. The research is still new, but taking precautions cannot hurt. You can and should address any concerns you have with your doctors, who may be able to make suggestions to help assuage those fears.

Many of us hear of and sometimes witness the aftermath of such accidents on the roadways. However, fewer people are accustomed to hearing about and witnessing another type of car accident &#x2013; the car incursion.

A very recent example involves an astonishing incident in which a Nissan sedan launched over a center raised median, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/dramatic-video-captures-car-crashing-2nd-floor-dental/story?id=52353574" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crashing into the second floor of a dental office</a> in Santa Ana, California. According to law enforcement, the driver acknowledged using narcotics.
<h2>What is a car incursion?</h2>
When any type of vehicle crashes into a building, whether it is a bank, hospital, restaurant, home, or retail storefront, it is referred to as an incursion. These can be the most startling and surprising types of car crashes &#x2013; no person inside of a building expects to be threatened or hit by a motor vehicle. Although they seem rare, these incidents occur every day, leaving thousands injured and hundreds killed.
<h2>Causes of car incursion</h2>
The Storefront Safety Council, consisting of a number of experts in perimeter security and parking issues, has published statistics that may be surprising to some.

The data reveals that on average, about 60 times per day in the United States, a <a href="http://www.storefrontsafety.org/statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motor vehicle impacts a building structure of some type</a> &#x2013; examples include convenience stores, fast food restaurants, hospitals, grocery stores, residential homes, etc. Even more startling, in any given year, some 4,000 injuries to customers, employees, and pedestrians result from these crashes &#x2013; and, some 500 are fatally injured.

Numerous factors can precipitate the loss of control of a vehicle and its subsequent impact into a building structure. Some of the clearly negligent causes producing these crashes include:
<ul>
    <li>Driving while fatigued</li>
    <li>Pedal confusion</li>
    <li>Driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs or other controlled substances</li>
    <li>Driving while distracted (texting, talking on cell phone, using GPS, etc.)</li>
    <li>Speeding or reckless driving</li>
    <li>Nose-in, <a href="https://www.naiop.org/en/Magazine/2014/Spring-2014/Development-Ownership/How-Safe-Is-Your-Parking-Lot.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perpendicular positioning of parking lot spaces</a> to buildings</li>
</ul>
Other causes may not be due to negligence, but are nevertheless unfortunate, including:
<ul>
    <li>Auto defects causing a vehicle or its components to malfunction or fail to respond to driver control</li>
    <li>Defective design of parking lots or accompanying roads</li>
    <li>Serious medical occurrences such as strokes, heart attacks, or seizures</li>
    <li>Other debilitating medical occurrences such as hypoglycemic shock from diabetes, anaphylactic shock from an allergic to wasp or bee stings, or another health condition that causes sudden disorientation, severe pain, or unconsciousness while driving</li>
</ul>
Car incursions are not addressed by Kentucky&#x2019;s or Ohio&#x2019;s traffic laws specifically, due to the fact that these incidents usually result from statutory violations such as DUI, reckless driving, or speeding. If, however, such a crash occurs because of a defective auto part, defective design, or the negligence of a third-party, injury victims may have legal recourse to seek compensation.

Getting the blood supply moving back into the brain is critical to keeping brain tissue alive and functioning. For years, doctors believed that this had to be done within six hours, or the damage done to the brain would be permanent.

As it turns out, they might have much more time, after all.

<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/new-research-will-radically-change-response-to-strokes/2018/01/24/e35da0e8-011d-11e8-8acf-ad2991367d9d_story.html?utm_term=.462e3da8e12d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New research</a> has shown that &#x201C;While some brain tissue dies quickly after a stroke begins, in most patients, collateral blood vessels usually take over feeding a larger area of the brain that is also starved for blood and oxygen, giving doctors many more hours to save that tissue than they previously believed,&#x201D; per the <em>Washington Post.</em> Instead of six hours, doctors may have as many as 16, or even 24 hours, in which to begin treatment. The study was so successful, the <em>Post</em> reports, that the researchers put an end to it early, so they could report their findings.
<h2>Fast facts about strokes</h2>
Strokes are classified three ways:
<ul>
    <li>An <strong>ischemic stroke</strong> is caused by an obstruction in the blood vessels (clot), and it is the most common type.</li>
    <li><strong>Transient ischemic attacks</strong> are caused by temporary clots. They&#x2019;re sometimes called &#x201C;mini strokes.&#x201D;</li>
    <li><strong>Hemorrhagic strokes</strong> are the result of a ruptured blood vessel.</li>
</ul>
Strokes are responsible for approximately <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">140,000 deaths per year in the U.S</a>., and is, overall, the fifth leading cause of death in the country. These percentages are mimicked in both Ohio and Kentucky. In 2014, the most recent year available, strokes were responsible for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/kentucky.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2050 deaths in Kentucky</a>, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/ohio.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5791 deaths in Ohio</a>.
<h2>What the research found</h2>
Before, doctors believed that they had a six-hour window in which to treat the clogged or ruptured blood vessels; longer than that, and the brain tissue would be irreparably harmed. If someone had a stroke right in front of another person, who could then call 911, the doctors could feel confident in that time slot. However, for those who had strokes in their sleep or while alone, there was no way to determine how much damage had been done. Even if the person&#x2019;s life could be saved, there was no way of knowing whether he or she would suffer permanent brain damage.

However, for about half of all patients, the damage done by a stroke moves more slowly than it does for others. This means that doctors have a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-stroke/study-confirms-late-clot-extraction-can-save-brain-cells-of-stroke-victims-idUSKBN1FD2SI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longer window to remove the clot,</a> without fear of additional damage to the brain, per a Reuters reports.

Researchers &#x201C;looked at 182 people in 38 medical centers who suffered the kinds of blockages in brain arteries that cause 50 to 60 percent of deaths and the most severe kinds of disabilities.&#x201D; Around half of those people received the standard of care: medication and intervention; &#x201C;The other half had images taken and the clot removal procedure, known as a &#x2018;thrombectomy,&#x2019; as well as the medications.&#x201D;

The imaging was the game-changer. It could show larger areas of damaged tissue, so doctors knew exactly how much tissue was dead, and how much was in danger. It also showed how the damage was progressing. Patients with slower progressions are good candidates for thrombectomies.

The results were extraordinary: 26% of the &#x201C;control&#x201D; group died, compared to only 14% of the group who had thrombectomies. Furthermore, 45% of the patients who had thrombectomies avoided severe disabilities and were able to &#x201C;resume &#x2018;functional independence.&#x2019;&#x201D;

Time is still critical in the diagnosis and treatment of strokes, but this new research could help doctors make better choices for their patients, and give patients a better chance at survival.

The FDA advisory concerning Limbrel, which is manufactured by Primus Pharmaceuticals, stated that the product has been connected to incidents of liver injury and other serious health issues. The agency recommended that consumers immediately stop taking the product it deems as a dangerous drug and get in touch with their healthcare provider.

Primus Pharmaceuticals markets the product as a medical food. However, in a letter to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Primus, James D. Weir, the FDA wrote &#x201C;The FDA has determined that these Limbrel products are unapproved new drugs and represent a serious health hazard.&#x201D;
<h2>What is Limbrel?</h2>
Limbrel (flavocoxid), at least as defined by its manufacturer, is a &#x201C;medical food product&#x201D; consisting of substances derived from plant sources called &#x201C;flavonoids.&#x201D; Some Limbrel products contain zinc glycinate. These products come in the form of capsules that can be taken daily. The manufacturer claims that the product reduces inflammation, which in turn reduces pain and swelling.
<h2>Reports of Lung and Liver Disease</h2>
As of November 21, 2017, the <a href="http://www.rheumatologyadvisor.com/osteoarthritis/fda-drug-safety-alert-recall-limbrel-life-threatening-drug-induced-liver-injury-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis/article/712405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDA had received 194 bad incident reports</a> connected with the products. These reports led to the conclusion by the FDA that the use of Limbrel is connected to such illnesses and diseases as pancreatitis, drug induced liver injury, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/SafetyAlertsAdvisories/ucm585992.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of adverse reports increased to 200</a> by December 4, 2017.

The nature of some of these conditions, which makes them even more dangerous and difficult to address promptly, is that they may not become noticeable immediately. Symptoms may only manifest at the point when hospitalization is required.

In response to the FDA&#x2019;s actions, on December 21, 2017, Primus Pharmaceuticals ceased all promotion and sale of its Limbrel products.
<h2>Limbrel as a &#x201C;Medical Food Product&#x201D;</h2>
In 2004, Limbrel was approved for the treatment of chronic osteoarthritis. Although the product contains ingredients that are derived from plants, it is only available to patients through a valid prescription.

The definition of a &#x201C;medical food&#x201D; is a product that is intended to be taken under the supervision and direction of the physician.

The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orphan Drug Act stipulates</a> that medical food products are designed for the &#x201C;dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.&#x201D;

Medical food products are designed for purposes of treating a medical condition, rather than to simply enhance the health of already healthy individuals. These products do not require the pre-marketing study of their effectiveness and safety, as do drugs.

In the FDA&#x2019;s letter to Primus, the agency not only urged the recall, but also asserted that Limbrel was incorrectly branded and did not qualify under the definition of a medical food. The FDA also informed the company that it was &#x201C;not aware of any distinctive nutritional requirements for individuals with osteoarthritis.&#x201D;

" width="300" height="205">We have long known that football is incredibly hard on the body. Shoulder, hand, and knee injuries are par for the course, but only recently have we been paying serious attention to the issue of brain injuries in the NFL. Doctors are studying concussions, its links to dementia, and links to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is a degenerative brain condition believed to be caused by repeated blows to the head. It&apos;s commonly found in athletes, military veterans, and others with a history of repetitive head trauma.

Scientists recently found an interesting connection between patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and, of all things, woodpeckers. Although it&apos;s not that strange if you think about it. If you&apos;ve ever been annoyed by a woodpecker in your yard, you know that they spend hours slamming their heads back and forth into a tree. They&apos;ll do this <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/fun-facts-about-woodpeckers-387095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 times</a> a second, at 15 miles an hour, thousands of times a day. Despite all of this hammering, though, woodpeckers don&apos;t appear to develop serious brain damage. If they did, they likely would have knocked themselves extinct a million years ago.

However, a recently released <a href="https://search.proquest.com/openview/437ed8356ae47366083760b0a4ea4ca2/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> shows that, unlike previously believed, woodpeckers actually may suffer some consequences from their relentless head-banging. This discovery could help future brain injury research.

For the study, researchers acquired dead birds from a museum, including some blackbirds as a control group. They searched their brains for a protein called tau. Usually a long, branching structure of nerve cells, tau dislodges from brain fibers during injury. After repeated injuries, tau clumps up in the brain, disrupting information flow. None of the blackbirds had tau accumulations, but eight out of 10 of the woodpeckers did.

This doesn&apos;t mean, though, that the level of tau was toxic and the woodpeckers were brain-damaged. In fact, some tau accumulation can be protective, as it lives inside the cells and can help stabilize neurons. It&apos;s unknown how much tau can dislodge and accumulate in a woodpecker brain before the bird might start behaving abnormally. A co-author of the study, Peter Cummings, who did not expect to see any tau in the birds&apos; brains, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/could-woodpeckers-teach-nfl-how-prevent-brain-injuries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that more work needs to be done to find out if the excess tau is a species adaptation to deal with head trauma, or if woodpeckers have ways of dissolving too much tau and prevent CTE.

Other things to keep in mind is that, of course, woodpecker brains and human brains are not the same. Human brains slosh around more in the skull than bird brains, giving them more room for injury. And one interesting thing that woodpeckers have that we don&apos;t? A long tongue that wraps underneath, up and around the back of the skull. A muscle that rests against the bird&apos;s jugular vein moves the tongue. In theory, a woodpecker can use that muscle to reduce the amount of blood flowing from its skull. In this way, it could protect its brain from sloshing around by filling its brain with blood. Some researchers think it&apos;s possible to design protective gear using this same design&#x2014;a <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/39/sport/how-woodpeckers-will-save-football" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collar</a> that puts just enough pressure on the neck to add a little bit of blood (safely) around the brain.

Of course, all of this needs much more research, but perhaps woodpeckers are the key to unlocking some mysteries about traumatic brain injuries and CTE.

The February accident is just the latest in a string of accidents for Amtrak.

Over the past few years, Amtrak has had its fair share of train accidents, causing fatalities and injuries.
<ul>
    <li><strong>May 12, 2015: </strong>A train killed eight passengers and injured hundreds when it derailed after traveling 106mph into a 50mph curve. An investigation found the engineer had lost awareness of where he was on the route.</li>
    <li><strong>April 3, 2016: </strong>A train traveling nearly 100mph near Philadelphia, PA slammed into a backhoe working on the track, killing two workers and injuring 39 train passengers. Investigators discovered safety and communications errors, including a failure to notify trains that the track was closed.</li>
    <li><strong>Dec. 18, 2017:</strong> A train derailed in DuPont, WA after traveling 80mph into a curve. Three passengers were killed and dozens were injured.</li>
    <li><strong>Jan. 31, 2018:</strong> A train collided with a garbage truck at a railroad crossing in Crozet, VA, killing the truck driver. The crossing had crossbars and warning lights.</li>
    <li><strong>Feb. 4, 2018:</strong> In the most recent Amtrak accident, a train collided with a CSX freight train parked on a side track in SC, killing the engineer and conductor. So far, the investigators have found that a switch was manually locked to divert the Amtrak train to the side track and toward the parked train. Work crews were in the middle of updating braking technology on the tracks when the accident occurred.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fast facts about positive train control</h2>
Positive train control (PTC) is a technology system designed to prevent excessive speed, avoid collisions, and make up for other human errors. It combines GPS, wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding, derailing or speeding. PTC systems know the location of all trains and the positions of all switches in a certain area and are designed to prevent two trains from traveling on the same track at the same time&#x2014;which would likely have prevented the fatal accident in South Carolina.

So why isn&apos;t PTC installed nationwide? Interestingly enough, in 2008 Congress mandated that PTC be installed on critical areas of railroad track by 2015. However, it became clear by late 2015 that railroads were not going to meet the deadline due to technology issues and high costs, and it was extended to the end of 2018. If certain requirements are met, that deadline can be extended further, to 2020.

PTC is set to be a focus of a February 15 meeting of the House Transportation Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials.

Dealing with the aftereffects of a train accident is difficult. You can turn to a compassionate personal injury attorney at Crandall &amp; Pera Law to pursue legal justice on your behalf.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6581" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-603266080-1-300x157.jpg" alt="What is Surgical Malpractice?" width="300" height="157">Surgery, regardless of how minor it may be, is always significant to the individual undergoing the procedure. Whether the surgery involves a fast outpatient procedure or something as serious as a heart bypass, there is always a certain risk of an error occurring. However, an error involved in a surgical procedure by itself does not necessarily equate to medical malpractice.
<h2>What is a surgical error?</h2>
A surgical error is a preventable mistake that occurs during the course of surgery. Due to the fact that all surgeries in one way or the other carry an element of risk, as a patient you are typically required to sign an informed consent document that verifies you understand the risks involved.
<h2>Has surgical malpractice occurred?</h2>
In order to qualify as malpractice, the medical treatment or surgery in question must have been carried out at a substandard level &#x2013; that is, a level below the accepted medical standard of care. The standard of care is generally defined as the accepted safety standards a reasonable surgeon would be expected to meet in similar circumstances.&#xA0; If a surgical error did not fall below that standard of care, or you did not incur harm from the error, no surgical malpractice may be claimed.

It is important to hold doctors, nurses, and surgeons responsible for failures to provide proper care due to malpractice. This can be done by proving that the proper safety standards were not met and it resulted in the patient&#x2019;s injuries and suffering.
<h2>Types of surgical errors</h2>
Various types of surgical errors that constitute surgical malpractice can occur in the operating room. These include:
<ul>
    <li>Failure to properly sterilize equipment</li>
    <li>Operating on the wrong part of the body leading to health complications, physical damage, or the removal of a body part or limb in error</li>
    <li>Failure to properly handle anesthesia</li>
    <li>Mistakes that lead to cutting or damaging a body part in the vicinity of the operational zone, such as a nerve, organ, artery, tissue, intestine, or ligament.</li>
    <li>Performing an unnecessary surgery</li>
    <li>Failure to remove surgical instruments or sponges from inside the patient&#x2019;s body</li>
    <li>Performing an operation on the wrong patient</li>
</ul>
<h2>Astonishing surgical malpractice examples</h2>
Some of the stories involving surgical malpractice are truly astounding. Below are a couple of real-life occurrences:

<strong>Surgeon&#x2019;s tools left inside patient</strong>

At Washington Medical Center in June 2000, Donald Church, 49, was put under surgery with properly administered anesthesia to remove a tumor in his abdomen. The surgical removal of the tumor was successful. However, <a href="https://www.ahcmedia.com/articles/115882-found-13-inch-retractor-was-left-inside-a-patient" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in its place was left a medical instrument</a> &#x2013; a 13 inch long metal retractor.

<strong>Heart surgery on wrong patient</strong>

A 67-year-old woman had a procedure done in the hospital called a cerebral angiography. After the procedure was completed she was taken to a hospital room on a different floor from the one prior to her procedure. The plan was to have her discharged the next morning. Instead, she was taken to another area for an invasive cardiac electrophysiology study. The woman was <a href="http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/715318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subjected to the procedure for about an hour</a>. The procedure was stopped and the woman was returned to her room. Although in stable condition, the consequences of what was done increased her risk of infection, internal bleeding, stroke, and heart attack.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6577" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-645357306-300x200.jpg" alt="How a Personal Injury Lawyer Can Help Injured Workers" width="300" height="200">Although it is common for employees injured in the workplace to obtain compensation through their employer&#x2019;s workers&#x2019; compensation insurance, sometimes workers may obtain compensation from others. These exceptions include situations in which you have the right to sue for damages as a result of your injuries. For example:
<ul>
    <li>You suffered injury from a toxic substance and file a toxic tort lawsuit against the manufacturer</li>
    <li>You suffered injury from a defective product</li>
    <li>Your employer does not carry workers&#x2019; compensation insurance</li>
    <li>Your employer caused your injury through egregious or intentional conduct</li>
    <li>A third-party caused your injury</li>
    <li>You are classified as a contractor, and therefore are ineligible for workers&#x2019; compensation</li>
</ul>
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, some <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/osh_11092017.htm">2.9 million worksite injuries occurred in 2016</a>. As usual, construction jobs were among the deadliest private industry jobs. Nearly a thousand workers <a href="https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html">lost their lives</a> that same year. Thankfully, construction workers and their families often have legal options if they wish to pursue a claim.
<h2>Filing a product liability lawsuit</h2>
When a worker incurs an injury from equipment or machinery that has a defect, fails to function properly, or is highly dangerous to use, liability may rest on the manufacturer for the injury if the manufacturer was aware of the danger and/or failed to provide proper warning to the business or employees. A legally liable manufacturer may be required to compensate an injured construction worker for pain and suffering, lost wages, and medical bills.
<h2>Toxic torts: making a claim after a work-related illness</h2>
Certain chemicals and other substances used in the workplace have the potential to cause serious injuries and illnesses to workers. Some substances that may cause such harm include radium, benzene, asbestos, silica, and chromium compounds. These and other potentially harmful substances have the potential to become the subject of a toxic tort lawsuit.

Toxic injuries can be divided into two categories: acute and latent. Acute injuries are immediately apparent. Some examples include chemical poisoning and chemical burns. Latent injuries take time to manifest &#x2013; in certain cases even years. Examples include various types of cancers as well as lung disease.

Due to the time delay often accompanying latent injuries, they are generally more difficult to prove in court than acute injuries. However, successful lawsuits concerning latent toxic injuries are certainly possible. Many successful latent injury lawsuits have occurred from workers who have suffered from mesothelioma and asbestos, for example.

The liability for a toxic substance injury often rests on the manufacture of the substance and/or any manufacturers of equipment intended to safely handle the substance, but failed to do so.

The issues surrounding exposure to toxic substances and subsequent injuries and/or illnesses can be complex and difficult to sort out. However, a skilled personal injury attorney who handles these cases can investigate your case thoroughly, sort out the issues, and litigate effectively for the best settlement possible based on your injuries.

Our team at Crandall &amp; Pera Law is experienced at successfully handling workplace injury cases for our clients in Ohio and Kentucky.

The man was in a crosswalk when the driver of a box truck lost control of his vehicle on some ice and went off the road. The driver hit a utility pole, struck a bus stop sign, and two more utility poles. The truck then veered back into the road and hit the pedestrian.

During the crash, the side of the truck was sheared off, causing two unsecured motorcycles to fall out of the truck onto the pedestrian. He was later pronounced dead at an area hospital. The driver initially fled from the scene, but later returned to surrender to authorities. The case has been turned over to prosecutors to consider charges against the driver.
<h2>Who is liable in a bad weather accident?</h2>
This might look like a bizarre but tragic truck accident on the surface. After all, if bad weather is responsible for the crash and subsequent falling cargo, can you really assign liability?

Yes, you can.

Drivers have a duty to other vehicles and pedestrians to drive safely and appropriately under all weather conditions, and that includes snow and ice. We are all aware of the dangers of winter weather and snow and ice, and should be able to adjust our driving to keep ourselves and others safe. In fact, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8327530512301413932&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,36" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oechsle v. Hart</a></em> that &#x201C;skidding upon a wet or icy roadway due to bad road conditions alone does not excuse a driver from operating his vehicle upon the right side of the roadway.&#x201D; In this court case, a vehicle left its lane after hitting an unexpected patch of ice, and crashed into a car in the opposite direction. There was no other evidence of bad road conditions.

A reasonable person should know that if it&apos;s snowing and/or roads are icy, they should be driving with extra caution by traveling at a lower speed. They should also know if their vehicle isn&apos;t equipped to safely travel in winter conditions. And, they should know whether or not they have the driving experience to navigate winter weather conditions safely. These are all issues that your attorney should investigate.

This particular truck accident brings up even more questions of liability. Did the unsecured motorcycles contribute to the pedestrian&apos;s death? If so, who loaded the bikes on the truck? The driver? A warehouse worker? The company that owns the motorcycles? And there&apos;s also the fact that the driver initially left the scene of the accident, which could potentially bring additional charges.

If you were injured, or someone you love was killed, in a truck accident, the Kentucky and Ohio truck accident lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law are here to help you achieve justice. We have the resources and skills to hold all responsible parties accountable for wrongful death and serious injuries. Please call our Ohio office at 877-686-8879, or in Kentucky at 877-651-7764.

The article highlighted the issue of confidential settlements, and the legal loopholes that allow surgeons who have been accused of a crime to remain on staff and keep allegations off of their records.

First, some quick background. Ryan Williams, a colorectal surgeon formerly of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, was accused of rape by two patients in 2008 and 2009. One was receiving a rectal exam when she was assaulted, and the other was under sedation and didn&apos;t remember what happened for several years. Police reports were filed in both cases. The USA TODAY article uncovered that the Cleveland Clinic was aware of the allegations and kept Williams on staff. Ultimately, Williams was never charged with a crime.

However, due to the attention from the article, an investigation has been opened by the Ohio Board of Medicine. Williams is not currently seeing patients at his new position after leaving the Cleveland Clinic.
<h2>The problem with confidentiality agreements</h2>
Over the past few months, there&apos;s been a lot of talk in Hollywood about the problem with sexual assault/harassment and confidential settlements. In many cases, confidential settlements act as a gag order that prevents the victim from speaking out about their experience, potentially setting up the attacker to repeat their behavior. The same can happen with cases of alleged medical malpractice.

If a patient ends up taking a settlement, they cannot publicly talk about what happened, or reveal the amount of the settlement. And, if the hospital takes over liability from a doctor accused of malpractice or assault, the accusation will never show up in the National Practitioner&apos;s Data Bank, a database of physicians which includes any disciplinary actions or charges against them.

Another issue with Williams&apos; case&#x2014;one of the women who accused and later sued him did so after the one-year statute of limitations had passed, so her lawsuit was filed as a &#x201C;miscellaneous tort claim&#x201D; and not malpractice. Because of these loose laws that allow unscrupulous doctors to get around the system, when Williams&apos; contract at the Cleveland Clinic was not renewed, he was able to pass a background check and obtain a position at Ohio State University (OSU) Wexner Medical Center.

He is now on paid administrative leave after <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/30/ohio-medical-board-investigating-former-cleveland-clinic-surgeon-over-rape-allegations/1044736001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA TODAY</a> brought the rape allegations to their attention.

Williams is denying the allegations. The Cleveland Clinic confirms they settled a civil case brought by one of the women. A spokesperson also noted that police investigated allegations from the second patient and did not find evidence anything occurred, although the incident she reported had happened five years prior. Williams also noted that he always had a chaperone with him while performing procedures, but a former assistant told the newspaper that it was not always possible to have someone in the room with him due to staffing issues.

As of this writing Williams&apos; case is still under investigation.

Now, bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2219/text?format=txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Stop Underrides Act of 2017</em></a> was introduced on n December 12, 2017 by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D- N.Y.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.); Reps. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) and Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) introduced the companion bill in the House.

Underride crashes occur when a car slides underneath the body of a large commercial truck. You might have noticed when you pass a large truck, if you are in a passenger car, the bottom of the cargo container of an 18-wheeler is just about eye-level with a passenger riding in a car. It does not take much of a leap to imagine what might happen in a crash if a passenger vehicle were to slide underneath a large truck when there is nothing there to keep it from happening. Passengers involved in underride crashes can become decapitated. Passengers who survive emerge with massive head and neck injuries even if the crash occurs at lower speeds.

Underride guards, which are already required for the back end of large commercial trucks, are metal and fiberglass buffers that attach to the sides of the truck and deflect the impact of a vehicle instead of allowing it to pass underneath the truck. You can see an underride guard in action at the <a href="http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/iihs-tests-show-benefits-of-side-underride-guards-for-semitrailers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&apos;s</a> website.

In the <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=48A97C09-7D4B-45D7-B2EE-AA4BF9395816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> about the bill&apos;s introduction, Representative Cohen read the names of just a few of the families who have lost loved ones in truck underride crashes, some of which have tirelessly advocated for this bill which could potentially save lives including, Marianne Karth, Lois Durso, Jennifer Tierney and especially Randy and Laurie Higginbotham.

Marianne Karth, who has dedicated her life to making sure that side underride guards become mandatory in the U.S. was able to share her story: &#x201C;I am the survivor of a terrible truck crash. I&apos;m the mom of two daughters, AnnaLeah &amp; Mary, who did not survive. The difference? Their part of the car went under the truck; mine did not. When I learned that hundreds of people die each year from underride and that something could have been done to prevent their deaths, I became a mom on a mission to make truck crashes more survivable.&#x201D;

Jacqueline Gillan, President, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety said, &#x201C;The Stop Underrides Act is a long-overdue solution to a long-standing safety problem. Every year hundreds of people are needlessly killed or severely injured in truck underride crashes. The National Transportation Safety Board has issued multiple recommendations for improved rear underride guards and for side and front underride protection systems. It is now time for action.&#x201D;

    <li><em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milicron Chemicals Inc</em>. ensured that workers could sue when their employers put them in harm&#x2019;s way.</li>
    <li><em>Griffith v. Mt. Carmel East</em> mandated that trauma victims be taken to hospitals and facilities with the ability to properly care for them.</li>
</ul>

<h1><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6653" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Frozen-Embryos-Were-Destroyed-University-Hospitals-Fertility-Center-Cleveland-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201">University Hospitals Fertility Clinic Lost Up to 4,000 Frozen Eggs and Embryos in Tank Failure</h1>
Women choose to freeze their eggs, and couples to freeze embryos, for a lot of reasons. But underneath almost all of them is an undercurrent of hope: that someday, in the future, those eggs or embryos will result in babies. That optimism is what helps many people through a complicated &#x2013; and expensive &#x2013; process of extracting, freezing, and (eventually) thawing and implanting.

It is also what makes the freezer malfunction at University Hospitals Fertility Clinic in Cleveland so heartbreaking. According to multiple news sources, something went awry with a long-term storage tank at the facility, which caused the temperature to drop sometime Saturday night (March 3<sup>rd</sup>) and Sunday morning (March 4<sup>th</sup>). The Plain Dealer reported &#x201C;University Hospitals has <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2018/03/university_hospitals_notifies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notified about 700 fertility patients and their families</a> that the frozen eggs and embryos they had stored at one of its hospitals may have been damaged over the weekend when the temperature rose in a storage tank.&#x201D;

Dr. James Liu, Chair of UH Cleveland Medical Center&#x2019;s department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said there is evidence of damage. However, the only way to know for sure is to thaw out the eggs and embryos. Because the freezing process can damage the specimens, there is no safe way to thaw and then re-freeze the specimens from the tank. He told the paper &#x201C;Some samples that were unfrozen for scheduled procedures this week were not viable.&#x201D;

As of March 27, 2018, approximately 950 patients are believed to have been affected. In total, more than 4,000 frozen eggs and embryos were lost. You can to read the updated letter from <a href="http://news.uhhospitals.org/news-releases/uh-fertility-clinic-update-patient-letter.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UH Fertility Clinic here</a>.
<h2>A horrific coincidence</h2>
The same exact weekend, almost the exact same situation unfolded at Pacific Fertility Clinic in San Francisco. CBS News reported that the clinic&#x2019;s President, Dr. Carl Herbert, said <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2nd-fertility-clinic-has-freezer-failure-jeopardizing-thousands-of-frozen-eggs-and-embryos/">close to 400 patients</a> have already been informed, and that officials &#x201C;also sent out emails explaining what had happened to two other groups -- roughly 100 patients who had tissue in both the problematic tank and another tank, and another, much larger group whose stored eggs and embryos weren&apos;t affected.&#x201D;

The clinic has not thawed any embryos, Dr. Herbert said, but they did thaw out some eggs &#x2013; all of which remained viable. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/fertility-clinic-informs-hundreds-of-patients-their-eggs-may-be-damaged/2018/03/11/b605ea82-2536-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html?utm_term=.16096543d93c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malfunctioning tank</a> &#x201C;contained &#x2018;several thousand&#x2019; eggs and embryos. Clinic spokesman Alden Romney said that represents as much as 15 percent of the total stored at the facility,&#x201D; per the Washington Post.

The two clinics are not related or connected in any way.
<h2>What happens next?</h2>
Dr. Liu told The Plain Dealer that UH is asking each patient directly how he, she or they would like to proceed. Patients who wish to transfer their eggs or embryos to another facility may do so. No discussion has been forthcoming about compensation.

The Clinic does have a telephone number set up for patients who have been contacted about their samples: 216-286-9740. You can also <a href="http://www.uhhospitals.org/make-an-appointment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach out to Clinic here</a>. The facility is located at:

<h2>Filing a lawsuit against the University Hospitals Fertility Clinic in Cleveland</h2>
<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/california/articles/2018-03-12/the-latest-california-fertility-clinic-adding-safeguards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Two lawsuits</a> have already been filed against the clinic: the first by a couple in Ohio, and the second by a couple in Pennsylvania. The first lawsuit, on behalf of Amber and Elliot Ash, seeks class action status. The couple had two embryos stored at the facility, both of which have been deemed non-viable. The Pennsylvania couple, which has spent the last eight years trying to conceive, told the <em>Associated Press</em> that &#x201C;they were beginning the process last week of transferring the frozen embryo when they later were told something went wrong.&#x201D;

These surgery centers offer same day, outpatient surgical services that are typically more cost effective and more convenient than getting the procedure done at a regular hospital. There are more than 5,616 Medicare-certified ambulatory surgical centers throughout the country, and many of them are owned by the doctors who work there. A joint investigation by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/02/medicare-certified-surgery-centers-safety-deaths/363172002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today</a> and <a href="https://khn.org/news/medicare-certified-surgery-centers-are-expanding-but-deaths-question-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Health News</a>, however, uncovered dangerous conditions in these surgical centers that seem to have led to the deaths of at least 260 patients since 2013.
<h2>What are the problems with ambulatory surgical centers?</h2>
Because they are large institutions, hospitals have systems and processes in place to manage risk and deal with emergencies proactively. A small, freestanding surgical suite may not have the resources to handle life-threatening emergencies that can occur when a routine surgical procedure goes awry. Some of the inherent risks of surgical centers include:
<ul>
    <li>Lack of oversight and patient monitoring</li>
    <li>Discharging surgical patients too soon</li>
    <li>Failure to properly sterilize equipment</li>
    <li>Lack of intensive care equipment/facilities</li>
    <li>Performing procedures inappropriate for a surgical center</li>
    <li>Equipment failure/ lack of backup equipment</li>
    <li>Failure to obtain informed consent from the patient</li>
    <li>Lack of accreditation. If the surgical center is not going to accept Medicare or private insurance, they have fewer safety requirements putting patients at higher risk of injury.</li>
</ul>
The <em>USA Today</em> story highlights what happened to Paulina Tam, a 58-year-old mother who went into a surgical center for surgery and died from complications because the surgical center had to call 911 when she went into distress following the procedure.
<h2>At least 14 patients have died after complex spinal surgeries in surgical centers</h2>
Many patients have not survived the trip from the surgical center to the emergency room&#xA0; to address complications that occurred following surgery. <em>USA Today</em> and the <em>Kaiser Health News</em> network contacted 24 doctors that own surgical centers about patient deaths and none of them was willing to answer questions. The executive director of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association declined a request for comment for the report saying only that there is no data that proves surgery centers are less safe than hospitals.
<h2>Ambulatory surgical centers in Ohio and Kentucky</h2>
The following is a list of a few of the outpatient day surgery centers in our area:
<ul>
    <li>Laser Spine Institute</li>
    <li>Big Creek Surgery Center</li>
    <li>Wright Surgery Center</li>
    <li>North Shore Gastroenterology</li>
    <li>Cleveland Surgical Suites</li>
</ul>
Lexington, KY outpatient surgical centers:
<ul>
    <li>Lexington Clinic Outpatient Surgery and Endoscopy Centers</li>
    <li>Cosmetic Surgery Center</li>
    <li>Stone Road Surgery Center</li>
    <li>Baptist-Physicians&apos; Surgery Center</li>
    <li>Surgery on Sunday</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ambulatory surgical centers generate profits for doctors</h2>
Doctors are permitted by law to steer patients to a surgical center that they own rather than to a full-service hospital, which increases the doctor&apos;s profits. When surgical centers take on complex cases they are not equipped to handle if the procedure goes wrong, those centers are thoughtless and careless. They take these complex cases because it is where the big profits can be found.

The challenge with all these cases is that most reach confidential settlements. As a result, no one hears about the stories of these needless deaths, and the public remains unaware of the potential danger of surgical centers. While these centers offer convenience and lower costs, they also carry different risks if things go wrong.

Flu season, as the fall and winter months are often called, usually begins in late October, peaks between December and February, and can linger into May, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC publishes a weekly influenza report, and as of the third week in February, while the influenza virus continues to be predominant, the number of cases testing positive for flu began to decline for the first time since October 2017. The CDC has also published a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequently-asked questions page</a> about this particularly virulent flu season.

There have been 114 pediatric deaths from flu since October, the number of regions reporting widespread flu activity is 49 of 54, and a cumulative rate of 81.7% laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations per 100,000 population was reported. (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC</a>)

A story in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/health/flu-rates-deaths.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>New York Times</em></a> reported that people over age 65 are the most likely to be hospitalized for flu, but those between the ages of 50-64 are the next highest age cohort for hospitalizations from the flu.
<h2>Flu season tracking for Kentucky and Ohio</h2>
<a href="https://www.odh.ohio.gov/en/seasflu/Ohio-Flu-Activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ohio Department of Health</a> tracks seasonal flu activity weekly throughout the year. The ODH website has data for weekly flu activity that goes back to 2012. Kentucky also tracks weekly flu activity, and they have a frequently-asked question section on their site with information about the flu, what to do if you think you or your children are infected, and who should get the flu vaccine.
<h2>Flu shot injuries</h2>
Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Children&#x2019;s National Health System in Washington, D.C. said in a story in <a href="http://time.com/5113281/flu-death-toll-children-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Time Magazine</em></a>, &quot;The most important thing parents can do to protect their children is to make sure they get vaccinated every flu season. It&apos;s not perfect and it&apos;s not 100% effective, but it&apos;s the best thing we have, and the flu vaccine is one of the safest, most vetted and most studied vaccinations there is.&quot;

Despite the purported safety of the flu vaccine, every year the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) settles cases for individuals who have been injured and for the loved ones of people who have died from vaccine injuries.

<a href="http://vaccineimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/12/DOJ-Update-12.17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Department of Justice</a> publishes a quarterly report on vaccine injuries and deaths. In the December 2017 report, there were 85 cases listed. Of those 85 cases, 71 were injuries from the flu vaccine with the most common injury being SIRVA (shoulder injuries related to vaccine administration) and GBS (Guillain-Barre Syndrome). SIRVA is believed to be caused by an immune response following an inadvertent, direct injection of vaccine into the deltoid bursa or joint space, which brings on severe, long-lasting shoulder pain and limits range of motion. (<a href="http://www.aappublications.org/news/2017/09/01/IDSnapshot082917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>) The National Institutes of Health (NIH) describe Guillain-Barre syndrome as a disorder in which the body&apos;s immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. Symptoms include weakness or tingling sensation in the legs that can spread to the arms and upper body and can lead to almost complete paralysis.
<h2>What can you do if you have been injured after receiving a flu shot?</h2>
What can you do if you have been injured after receiving a flu shot?

If you should suffer a flu vaccine-related injury, or an injury from any vaccine, you can consult with a vaccine injury lawyer, who will file a claim in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in a no-fault claim. There is a statute of limitations of three years from the date of the adverse reaction for you to file your claim. The amount of your compensation depends on the extent of the illness or injury from the vaccine.

Some of the most common flu shot injuries include:
<ul>
    <li>SIRVA</li>
    <li>Guillain-Barre Syndrome</li>
    <li>CIDP (Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy)</li>
    <li>Allergic reaction</li>
    <li>Brachial Neuritis</li>
    <li>Transverse Myelitis (TM)</li>
    <li>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO)</li>
    <li>Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)</li>
    <li>Optic neuritis</li>
    <li>Brachial neuritis</li>
    <li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li>
    <li>Seizures</li>
    <li>Peripheral neuropathy</li>
    <li>Encephalopathy</li>
    <li>Cerebellar ataxia</li>
</ul>
It does not cost anything to hire a vaccine injury attorney as the U.S. Court of Federal Claims pays our legal fees, which allows you to keep all of the compensation you receive if you win your case. If you, your child or someone else you care about has suffered an injury after receiving a vaccine, we are here to help make sure that your rights are protected.

The process of making a claim for compensation from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is complicated. You want an injury lawyer you can trust and who knows how to build a successful case on your behalf.

Distracted walking accident injuries are on the rise, as you might have guessed. In 2017, there were nearly 6,000 pedestrian fatalities, according a <a href="https://www.ghsa.org/issues/bicyclists-pedestrians" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Governor&apos;s Highway Safety Association</a> report. The NSC warns that Americans are losing their focus on their surroundings and placing themselves in danger.

There were so many pedestrian fatalities and injuries associated with texting while walking for the second year in a row, that the National Safety Council added the category of &quot;distracted walking&quot; to the injury statistics that they gather each year.
<h2>Distracted walkers, meet distracted drivers</h2>
People who engage in distracted walking seem to have the mistaken idea that the world around them is in suspended animation as they move through it. But, they would be wrong. Imagine the catastrophe that would occur if a distracted walker &#x2013; staring intently at their phone &#x2013; wandered across the street in front of a driver who was also staring at the screen of their mobile device.
<h2>Who is liable in a distracted walking car crash?</h2>
Pedestrians generally have the right of way within a marked pedestrian walkway.&#xA0; In fact, pedestrians almost always have the right of way when crossing the street. Drivers must remain alert when driving in locations where pedestrians are present and yield to pedestrians. For safety purposes, it is vital that pedestrians look up, and look both ways, before crossing the street. It is also vital that drivers put their phones down and keep them out of sight when they are driving.

In most instances, when there is a pedestrian collision with a motor vehicle, the driver will be held liable&#xA0; If, however, the pedestrian is jaywalking with their head down and completely unaware of traffic, the driver will probably &#xA0;not be held liable for that accident. Any kind of motor vehicle accident can be complex&#xA0; and you are best served by an experienced car accident attorney if you have been injured in a crash.

Your car crash or pedestrian accident case is important to us, and we want to help you.

Litigation can be expensive, and going to court can be frightening. Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) approach, which can be faster and more cost effective than taking a case to trial. If you and your lawyer decide that going to trial is not your best option, mediation might be another route to try.
<h2>Why would you choose mediation to resolve a car crash claim?</h2>
Mediation is a non-binding process where the two parties work with a neutral third party to come to a mutually agreeable settlement. For mediation to proceed, both parties must agree to it, split the cost of the mediator, and hire their own legal representation to guide them through the negotiations. The mediator&apos;s task is to bring the two parties together in an agreement.

It is<em> not</em> the mediator&apos;s job to make any type of ruling. If the two parties fail to come to a settlement agreement, they can take the case to court.
<h2>How does mediation work?</h2>
Each side will prepare a brief which presents the evidence supporting their position, and whatever they are demanding from the settlement. Each side submits their brief to the mediator. The mediator will give a brief introduction, and they will remind the parties that whatever happens in mediation remains confidential. (What happens in mediation stays in mediation.) If the case should end up going to trial, none of what goes on in the mediation session can be used as evidence in court.

Often, the mediator will dismiss each party and their counsel to separate conference rooms. The mediator will go back and forth between the rooms carrying back and forth the latest settlement offer. This will continue until the parties settle or realize that the case isn&#x2019;t likely to settle
<h2>How long does mediation take?</h2>
If both parties are determined to come to a workable solution, a car crash mediation session can be completed in a single work day. Sometimes, depending on the complexity of the case, and how far apart the parties find themselves, it could take a few days to resolve.

Suffering an injury in a serious car accident can be a devastating experience. If you want aggressive representation from a trusted team of car accident attorneys, look to Crandall &amp; Pera Law.

For most of us, driving can be a leisure activity. Maybe not that sitting-in-traffic daily commute, but lovely weekend drives to admire local scenery, or just to get the car out on the open road in some nice weather. However, a pleasure drive can turn downright dangerous when confronted with hazards like distracted drivers, which is why we always need to remain vigilant behind the wheel.

April is <a href="http://www.nsc.org/learn/NSC-Initiatives/Pages/distracted-driving-awareness-month.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Distracted Driving Awareness Month</a>, so we&apos;ve put together some facts and tips about distracted driving to give you some knowledge about the issue and avoid falling into the distracted driving trap yourself.
<h2>Facts about distracted driving</h2>
Our cell phones mostly feel like an extension of ourselves, which might make us forget that they can take our attention away from the road. For example, driving and talking on the phone gives you the same level of impairment as driving while intoxicated (a BAC of 0.08%). And sending or reading a text is the same as driving the length of a football field at 55 mph blindfolded. And texting behind the wheel increases the risk of having a car accident or near-crashing by 23 times. [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=&quot;yes&quot; overflow=&quot;visible&quot;][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=&quot;1_1&quot; background_position=&quot;left top&quot; background_color=&quot;&quot; border_size=&quot;&quot; border_color=&quot;&quot; border_style=&quot;solid&quot; spacing=&quot;yes&quot; background_image=&quot;&quot; background_repeat=&quot;no-repeat&quot; padding=&quot;&quot; margin_top=&quot;0px&quot; margin_bottom=&quot;0px&quot; class=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;&quot; animation_type=&quot;&quot; animation_speed=&quot;0.3&quot; animation_direction=&quot;left&quot; hide_on_mobile=&quot;no&quot; center_content=&quot;no&quot; min_height=&quot;none&quot;][<a href="https://www.enddd.org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EndDD.org</a>]

However, using your phone while driving isn&apos;t the only form of distracted driving. Anything that takes your mind off the task at hand&#x2014;your eyes off the road or your hands off the steering wheel&#x2014;is considered distracted driving. This could include grooming, eating, adjusting a GPS or mapping app, changing your music, or talking to passengers. They might not seem like activities that distract you from driving because they&apos;re so common and we don&apos;t think twice about doing them. However, they&apos;re in fact quite dangerous. In <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/812_381_distracteddriving2015.pdf">2015</a>, 3,477 people were killed and an additional 391,000 were injured in auto accidents involving distracted drivers.
<h2>Typical driving distractions</h2>
All kinds of distracted driving are dangerous, but it&apos;s evident from this list that technology is playing a bigger and bigger role in car accidents.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Phone calls:</strong> Making or taking calls distracts you from what you should be doing&#x2014;paying attention to your driving. Even using hands-free technology still takes your mind off the road.</li>
    <li><strong>Using social media:</strong> As crazy as it might seem, some people update or check social media behind the wheel. We shouldn&apos;t have to say that nothing is that important. It can wait.</li>
    <li><strong>Texting:</strong> Texting while driving is extremely dangerous and takes your eyes and hands off the road. Even voice-to-text applications can be distracting.</li>
    <li><strong>Music:</strong> Many drivers also flip through songs on their phones or iPods, or fiddle around with the stereo system, while driving.</li>
    <li><strong>Eating and drinking:</strong> Consuming food or beverages while driving takes your hands off the wheel, your eyes off the road, and distracts your mind from the task at hand.</li>
    <li><strong>Drowsy driving:</strong> Driving while fatigued is as dangerous as driving drunk, and affects your cognitive function and ability to focus.</li>
    <li><strong>Rubbernecking:</strong> Slowing down to look at an accident doesn&apos;t just cause traffic slowdowns. It also takes your eyes off the road and raises the risk of causing another accident.</li>
    <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> If your eyes are looking in the mirror while you&apos;re applying makeup or grooming, they&apos;re not on the road where they should be.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Avoiding distracted driving</h2>
How can you avoid driving while distracted? Just remember a few things and incorporate them into your driving habits. If you absolutely must talk on the phone, use a hands-free device. Avoid texting and driving. Program your GPS before you start driving&#x2014;even if you think you won&apos;t need it. You never know when you might get re-routed. Set your music playlist beforehand, too. Don&apos;t let yourself get distracted by your pets or passengers.

Simply put? Stay alert behind the wheel.

The story which confused authorities for several days involved an injured pregnant woman and serious damage to a famous landmark. But now they know the truth, and a Cincinnati man has been charged for his role in a crash that forced the months-long closure of the Roebling Suspension Bridge. Demarko D. Page, 24, of Cincinnati, faces three misdemeanors&#x2014;falsely reporting an incident, operating a motor vehicle on a suspended or revoked license, and failure of owner to maintain required insurance.

On March 20, Page had a car accident and crashed into the bridge. He was driving southbound, lost control of his vehicle, and the accident caused enough damage to bend a beam on the bridge. Authorities say slippery conditions and excessive speed were likely factors in the accident.

Kentucky transportation officials say the damage was so severe, the bridge will likely be closed through June for repairs.

Police say Page, the man who caused the crash, lied to them at first, telling them a story about how another man was behind the wheel of the car at the time and fled the scene. Initially, after the accident, Page told authorities that he and another passenger were in a bootleg cab, which are unauthorized rideshare vehicles.

He claimed the driver crashed the vehicle and ran off, leaving him and a pregnant woman behind. Police found the pregnant woman semi-conscious and lying on the sidewalk when they arrived. She was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center with what officials believed was a broken femur, according to police. But police now say that Page was actually the driver, but told police he was a passenger in the car because he had no license or insurance on the vehicle.

The crash caused significant damage to the bridge, and officials believe it will be closed even longer than the initial week or so that was initially expected. &quot;The impact was to the vertical portion,&quot; said District 6 Kentucky Transportation Cabinet public information officer <a href="http://www.wlwt.com/article/man-charged-in-crash-that-forced-months-long-closure-of-roebling-bridge/19632783" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nancy Wood</a>. &quot;There are several steel vertical pieces to this bridge structure and the impact did some significant damage to this particular one.... We estimate the repairs to be complete by June. Until then, the bridge will remain closed to all traffic, vehicles and pedestrians.&quot;

The Roebling Bridge was constructed in 1866 and spans the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky. It&apos;s an integral part of the area&apos;s landscape.

Even though we&apos;re celebrating spring and the end of flu season, the number of cases of influenza B is actually on the rise, medical professionals say. Most of the severe cases of flu we saw this season were a strain of influenza A, according to the CDC, but people are more recently being diagnosed with influenza B.

&#x201C;It&#x2019;s often the case where influenza A starts off the flu season, and then as the season goes on, influenza B becomes more important,&#x201D; said <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/living/health-fitness/article205619844.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Dean Blumberg</a>, an expert in infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. &#x201C;Influenza A caused almost all the influenza starting at the beginning of this season in 2017, and then once 2018 started, influenza B started causing a greater proportion of illnesses.&#x201D;
<h2>Flu season facts</h2>
Influenza B is typically not as severe as influenza A, but it can impact the health of young children more seriously. Children are <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/living/health-fitness/article205619844.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 percent</a> more likely to die from influenza B than from the A strains.

In fact, five pediatric deaths were reported during the week ending March 11, which brings the national total of flu-related deaths to 133. Seventeen states reported widespread flu outbreaks to the CDC. Nearly 250,000 people tested positive for the flu during this season. Almost 27,000 people were hospitalized due to the influenza A virus.

<h2>Avoiding the flu</h2>
The best way to avoid the flu is to practice good health habits.
<ul>
    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick. And if you are sick, avoid others to prevent spreading your illness to others. Stay home from work, school, or running errands.</li>
    <li>Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing to prevent germs from spreading.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands often to protect you from germs. Use soap and water. If those aren&apos;t available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth&#x2014;germs are spread when a person touches something contaminated and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>
    <li>Wipe down and disinfect surfaces at home, school, and work, especially when people are sick.</li>
    <li>Get enough sleep, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food.</li>
</ul>
It&apos;s also not too late to get a flu shot. Even if you&apos;ve already had the flu this year, you may want to consider getting the vaccine, as it&apos;s possible to become infected by multiple strains in one season. Anti-viral medications like Tamiflu are effective in minimizing flu symptoms, but they should be taken within 48 hours of onset of symptoms.

The CDC also advises that people with flu-like symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue seek medical attention as soon as possible to avoid possible severe or deadly complications.

BODY:
According to two recent studies, medical marijuana may be chipping away at the opioid problem in the United States. Advocates for legalizing marijuana have long held the belief that the plant is a lower-risk alternative to opioids, and can relieve chronic pain. However, those on the other side of the issue claim that marijuana could actually encourage opioid use and possibly make the epidemic worse. Let&apos;s take a look at the study.

Although these studies don&apos;t directly look at the effect of legalizing marijuana on opioid addiction and overdoses, they do find some evidence that legalization could reduce the prescribing of opioids. And over-prescribing is one of the key factors in the country&apos;s opioid problem.

<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2676999">These</a> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2677000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> were released on April 2, 2018 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.
<h2>Opioid prescribing dropped under Medicaid</h2>
One of the studies, which took place between 2011 and 2016, took a look at opioid prescribing under Medicaid. Medicaid covers low-income adults. Researchers compared states where marijuana laws were in effect versus states where it was illegal. They found that when people were permitted to use marijuana to treat their medical conditions, there was a six percent lower rate of opioid prescribing for pain. In other words, for every thousand people using Medicaid, there were about 39 fewer opioid prescriptions.

Further, when states went on to allow recreational marijuana use in addition to medicinal, opioid prescriptions dropped by another six percent.
<h2>Opioid prescribing also dropped under Medicare</h2>
The second study took a deep dive into opioid prescribing under Medicare. Medicare covers those 65 years and older as well as those with disabilities. Again, researchers compared states with medical marijuana laws with those without for the years 2010 through 2015. They found that patients in these states filled prescriptions for about 14 percent fewer daily doses of opioids than those in the other states. And, patients in states that allowed them to grow pot at home showed around seven percent fewer doses.
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
&#x201C;Marijuana is one of the potential alternative drugs that can provide relief from pain at a relatively lower risk of addiction and virtually no risk of overdose,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/04/02/two-new-studies-show-how-marijuana-can-help-fight-the-opioid-epidemic/?utm_term=.ad47046a976e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wen and Hockenberry</a>, the authors of the Medicaid study, wrote. &#x201C;These findings suggest that medical and adult-use marijuana laws have the potential to reduce opioid prescribing for Medicaid enrollees, a segment of population with disproportionately high risk for chronic pain, opioid use disorder, and opioid overdose.&#x201D;

There are concerns, however, that marijuana use could open the door for experimentation with harder drugs. According to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28946762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> by Dr. Mark Olfson, marijuana users are six times more likely than non-users to abuse opioids.

BODY:
As everyone always says, &#x201C;We don&apos;t care if it&apos;s a boy or a girl, we just want our baby to be healthy.&#x201D; And, after months and months of anticipation, that&apos;s usually exactly how it goes&#x2014;a normal delivery of a healthy infant. However, in a small percentage of births, things unfortunately don&apos;t go as planned and your child is not, in fact, healthy. And you want and need answers. What went wrong? When did it go wrong? Could it have been prevented? Who is to blame?

Babies can suffer from two medical issues at birth, and it&apos;s important to be able to distinguish between the two of them: birth injuries and birth defects.
<h2>Birth defects</h2>
Birth defects occur as a baby develops in the womb. They&apos;re commonly detected&#x2014;or should be detected&#x2014;during pregnancy, although some may not show up until after delivery. Birth defects are typically caused by a genetic abnormality, but can also sometimes be caused by certain medications or drugs and alcohol.

Birth defects can occur in any part of an infant&apos;s body or brain, but the most severe focus on the nervous system. Common birth defects include heart problems, Down syndrome, spina bifida, fetal alcohol syndrome, cleft palates, or clubfoot.
<h2>Birth injuries</h2>
On the other hand, birth injuries occur during the birth process&#x2014;labor and delivery. Out of 4.3 million childbirths in United States hospitals, nearly <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb74.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">157,700</a> mothers and newborns sustained potentially avoidable injuries.

There are many different kinds of birth injuries, ranging from mild to serious. Babies can be born with broken bones or meconium aspiration syndrome, or with nerve or brain damage. Many of these injuries occur when an infant is deprived of oxygen during delivery. If a medical professional fails to monitor the mother&apos;s labor or any signs of fetal distress properly, or use excessive force during delivery, both the mother and child could potentially suffer injury. Common birth injuries include:
<ul>
    <li>Brachial plexus injuries</li>
    <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
    <li>Erb&apos;s Palsy</li>
    <li>Shoulder dystocia</li>
    <li>Klumpke&apos;s Palsy</li>
    <li>Subconjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding in the eyes)</li>
    <li>Fracture</li>
    <li>Paralysis</li>
</ul>
While birth defects are typically unavoidable, birth injuries are likely to have been caused by a failure in medical care. Delay to act, failure to notice complications, forceful delivery, or use of improper tools can all cause birth injuries that were otherwise avoidable. Some birth injuries are immediately noticeable, but some may not be detected until days or weeks after delivery.

You should remember, as a parent, that not all birth injuries are life-threatening. But with any injury, the most important thing is to get the best care for your child and ensure that they are as healthy as possible as they begin their life.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we fight on behalf of Kentucky and Ohio parents whose children have suffered a birth injury.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6727" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-26-at-9.17.01-AM-300x197.png" alt="Marc Pera Secures $515,000 Verdict against General Surgeon in Cincinnati" width="300" height="197">Crandall &amp; Pera Law will always fight on behalf of those who have sustained serious injuries because of medical negligence. That is why we are proud to announce that firm co-founder Marc Pera has obtained a $515,000 medical malpractice verdict against a General Surgeon in Cincinnati on behalf of the family of Monica McKnight. Before going to trial, the defense offered our client nothing.

The case itself was simple. Ms. McKnight was in the thrall of kidney failure. Because of the advanced stage of her illness, she was only given six years to live. She had to undergo a treatment called hemodialysis (commonly shortened to dialysis). Hemodialysis literally cleans your body of toxins and removes excess fluid when your kidneys no longer can. Per the <a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/hemodialysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Kidney Foundation</a>, &#x201C;In hemodialysis, a dialysis machine and a special filter called an artificial kidney, or a dialyzer, are used to clean your blood. To get your blood into the dialyzer, the doctor needs to make an access, or entrance, into your blood vessels.&#x201D;

There are three ways a doctor can create an access into your blood vessels:
<ul>
    <li>Through an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, which connects an artery to a vein</li>
    <li>Through an AV graft, where a small tube is used to connect an artery to a vein (usually for people with small or blocked veins)</li>
    <li>With a catheter, which is usually inserted into the jugular vein</li>
</ul>
But instead of inserting the catheter into the jugular, the surgeon inserted it into the carotid artery.
<h2>Arteries and veins do very different jobs</h2>
Despite the prevalence of popular media using these two terms interchangeably, there is a vast difference between arteries and veins. Arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Specifically, the carotid artery carries blood from the heart to the head and neck.

Veins carry deoxygenated blood from the body to the heart. The jugular vein in particular carries blood from the head and neck back to the heart.
<h2>What happened to Ms. McKnight?</h2>
Because the catheter was inserted into the carotid artery and not the jugular vein, blood clots developed. These clots traveled to Ms. McKnight&#x2019;s brain, and caused her to have a stroke the same day as the surgery was performed. She died four days later, as a result.

This was not a &#x201C;silly&#x201D; mistake; no doctor should ever mix up the carotid with the jugular. Furthermore, this act of medical malpractice cost the family of Monica McKnight precious time &#x2013; time she did not have much of, given the advanced stage of her illness &#x2013; with her, because she was denied the effective treatment she needed to survive. It caused Monica and her family undue pain, suffering and stress, and stole six years of her life away. Yet, despite the blatant surgical error, the insurance company refused to offer any compensation at all before the verdict was rendered.

Thanks to the efforts of Marc Pera, however, Ms. McKnight&#x2019;s family can rest a little easier tonight, knowing that justice has been served, and that the surgeon has been held accountable for his negligence.

BODY:
As more information came to light regarding the connection between Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and football, players, doctors, and managers started advocating for better and safer play. Though the NFL itself has been slow in responding (slow being the polite word), more and more people are coming around to the side of these players. Attendance has gone down at games, and a growing contingent of parents and schools have shifted from football to other sports.

Those parents are right. A study published in the <em>Annals of Neurology</em> has found &#x201C;that playing tackle football before age 12 could lead to long-term consequences later in life,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/04/30/cte-brain-diseases-start-earlier-tackle-football-played-before-12/563330002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports USA TODAY</a>. The lead researchers were from the VA Boston Healthcare System and Boston University School of Medicine, whose previous work found a connection between youth tackle football and CTE.
<h2>What the study said</h2>
Researchers looked at <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25245" target="_blank" rel="noopener">246 donated brains</a> for the study. Of those 265:
<ul>
    <li><strong>211 had evidence of CTE</strong></li>
    <li>126 &#x201C;were without comorbid neurodegenerative diseases,&#x201D; meaning they only showed signs of CTE</li>
    <li>35 brains showed no evidence of CTE at all</li>
</ul>
According to their findings, the age of the player did not indicate how severe the CTE pathology was. In other words, playing tackle football at a younger age did not mean that the player&#x2019;s CTE was more severe than those of players who started later. But what they did find was &#x201C;In the 211 participants with CTE, every one year younger participants began to play tackle football predicted earlier reported cognitive symptom onset by 2.44 years (p&lt;0.0001) and behavioral/mood symptoms by 2.50 years (p&lt;0.0001).&#x201D;

In layman&#x2019;s terms, how severe a player&#x2019;s CTE was had nothing to do with age &#x2013; but the younger the player was when he started, the faster the signs and symptoms showed up. For players who started before the age of 12, those signs started showing up, on average, 13.39 years later (cognitive) and 13.28 years later (behavioral). The same averages held true when the researchers looked at the 126 brains of players who only exhibited signs of CTE, without other conditions like Alzheimer&#x2019;s.
<h2>Want to protect your kids? Don&#x2019;t let them play football</h2>
Three years ago, we wrote an open letter to the parents of high school football players, urging them to keep their kids from playing. We work with people with serious brain injuries and cognitive damage every day, and it was important to us then &#x2013; just as it is now &#x2013; that we do what we can to help put a stop to this needless and incurable condition. That means keeping your kids away from football altogether.

This isn&#x2019;t a high school player problem. This isn&#x2019;t a college player problem. This isn&#x2019;t a professional player problem.

These are children. Playing tackle football as a child can lead to an incurable brain disease. That disease will eventually kill them. And that disease could take root in your child&#x2019;s brain before he is even old enough to ride alone on some of the roller coasters at King&#x2019;s Island.

The science is clear. Football causes brain damage, and the younger you are when you play, the faster the symptoms could show up.

Choose the future. Choose your children. Choose life.

This year&#x2019;s convention offered numerous opportunities for attendees to obtain their CLE credits, to play a few rounds of golf, and to network and reconnect with colleagues from throughout the state. This year&#x2019;s speeches (once again) stole the show, and Steve Crandall&#x2019;s presentation was a very big hit.

Titled &#x201C;Social Media in the Courtroom: The Effects on Jury Selection and Jury Verdicts,&#x201D; Steve&#x2019;s presentation focused on the psychological effects of social media on empathy and narcissism in society, in general. He also analyzed how this may affect jurors who hear Crandall &amp; Pera&#x2019;s cases at trial, and what effects that might have on the verdicts for injured clients, or for families filing wrongful death and survival actions.

What Steve found through his review of research was both interesting and informative. Many articles focused on the use of social media and concluded negative effects occur to both men and women who utilize social media for many hours each day. However, other articles indicate social media usage, when focused on communication with family and friends, can result in positive results for mood and feelings of self-worth. In the end, other articles pointed out it is how and why a person uses social media that may matter the most. If an individual uses social media to stay connected, positive results occur. Meanwhile, if the user focuses on self-promotion and changes their profile photo on a weekly basis, this can result in depression and narcissistic behavior.
<h2>Why social media usage and response matters in a jury trial setting</h2>
Aside from the obvious &#x2013; what lawyer doesn&#x2019;t want an empathetic jury? &#x2013; there are many reasons why social media usage matters when it comes to selecting a jury and to going to trial. Potential and selected jurors:
<ol>
    <li>Will likely review the attorney and the firm&#x2019;s social media usage.</li>
    <li>Will likely look one another up on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn (as well as Instagram and Snapchat).</li>
    <li>May disregard directions about avoiding information from the case &#x2013; or may be unwillingly subject to it through their own social media feeds.</li>
    <li>May reveal more about who they are on their own social media pages.</li>
</ol>
Understanding the correlation between how a juror posts, and the research regarding empathy and narcissism, could help a trial attorney determine the best way to present his or her case. In a medical malpractice trial, where people must weigh the facts about the case while contending their own feelings and preconceived notions about the medical profession and healthcare, this knowledge could prove invaluable to the attorney.

All of us at Crandall &amp; Pera Law want to extend a warm &#x201C;Congratulations!&#x201D; to Steve Crandall for a job well done at this year&#x2019;s OAJ Convention.

When you think about nursing home negligence, resident-to-resident abuse might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but it is a prevalent issue affecting nursing home and assisted living residents throughout the United States. The National Consumer Voice for Long-Term Care conducted a prevalence study on Resident-to-Resident Elder Mistreatment in Nursing Homes. The study defines resident-to-resident elder mistreatment in this way:

&quot;Negative physical, sexual, or verbal interactions between long-term care residents that in a community setting would likely be construed as unwelcome and have high potential to cause physical or psychological distress in the recipient.&quot;

In looking at the mistreatment of elders by their fellow residents, the study highlighted the story of Laura Lindquist, 98, who was indicted the strangling and suffocation of nursing home roommate Elizabeth Barrow, 100.
<h2>Examples of resident-to-resident elder mistreatment (RREM)</h2>
Some of the incidents reported in the study include the following examples of abusive behavior:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="234"><strong>Verbal abuse:</strong>

Cursing

Screaming

Verbal threats

&#xA0;

<strong>Physical abuse:</strong>

Hitting

Kicking

Biting

Scratching</td>
<td width="234"><strong>Sexual abuse:</strong>

Unwelcome verbal sexual advances

Exposing self

Touching/kissing/trying to get in bed

&#xA0;

<strong>Other abusive occurrences:</strong>

Throwing things

Destroying property

Threatening gestures

&#xA0;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
&#xA0;
<h2>The research study named the following as risk factors for RREM:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Residents with cognitive impairments</li>
    <li>Residents with behavioral symptoms related to their cognitive impairment</li>
    <li>Residents with a history of aggressive behavior and/or negative interactions with others</li>
</ul>
The study recommended that nursing facilities should do the following to help prevent resident-to-resident elder mistreatment:
<ul>
    <li>Develop a comprehensive care plan that provides individualized, resident-centered care.</li>
    <li>Identify residents with risk factors, prepare a care plan to meet their needs and monitor their movements</li>
    <li>Identify and address the root causes of behavioral symptoms and address them</li>
    <li>Provide adequate staffing</li>
    <li>Train the staff</li>
    <li>Identify and change environmental influences on behavior</li>
</ul>
Kentucky law requires the mandatory reporting of elder abuse or neglect. If you should witness any signs of physical abuse or neglect, signs of mistreatment, or if you find evidence of financial exploitation, you can report what you have seen to the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services at 1-877-597-2331.

In Ohio, you can report elder neglect or abuse to Adult Protective Services at: 1-855-OHIO-APS (1-855-644-6277) toll-free 24/7.

BODY:
Since its approval to go on the market in 2002, the implantable permanent birth control device Essure has been the subject of much controversy. Thousands of women have claimed the device has caused pain, internal bleeding, miscarriages, and stillbirths. The FDA finally responded on April 9 by <a href="https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm604098.htm?utm_campaign=04092018_PR_FDA%20Restricts%20Essure&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Eloqua" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issuing an order</a> restricting sales and distribution of Essure.

&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been closely evaluating new information on the use of Essure, and based on our review of a growing body of evidence, we believe this product requires additional, meaningful safeguards to ensure women are able to make informed decisions about risk when considering this option,&#x201D; said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. in the organization&apos;s public statement.

The Essure birth control device is the only non-surgical form of permanent birth control on the market in the United States. A medical professional inserts the implant&#x2014;flexible coils made of various metals&#x2014;into the patient&apos;s fallopian tubes by going through the vagina and cervix. When the device works correctly, scar tissue grows around the device over the next few months, building a barrier to prevent sperm from reaching and fertilizing eggs. However, some women have experienced perforation of the uterus and/or fallopian tubes, migration of inserts to the abdominal or pelvic cavity, persistent pain, and more as the device failed.

The FDA has received <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fda-limits-sales-of-controversial-birth-control-implant-1825143647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 25,000</a> &#x201C;adverse event&#x201D; reports regarding Essure since its entry into the market in 2002. Another report found that the implant may be linked to at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-essure-fda/fda-likely-underestimated-fetal-deaths-from-essure-analyst-idUSKCN0VR019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">303</a> fetal deaths. After the FDA began receiving these reports, they required Bayer, the manufacturer, to put a &#x201C;black box&#x201D; label on the device, which calls attention to the risks. Since the warning was added, sales dropped <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fda-limits-sales-of-controversial-birth-control-implant-1825143647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70%</a>, but many former users believed this warning was not enough&#x2014;and the FDA agreed.

Now, with the FDA&apos;s most recent order, Essure has tight restrictions on how it can be sold and distributed. Essure can only be distributed to health care providers and facilities that provide, review, and sign with patients a brochure that clearly outlines the risks of the device, entitled &#x201C;Patient-Doctor Discussion Checklist -- Acceptance of Risk and Informed Decision Acknowledgement.&#x201D; If Bayer fails to comply with these restrictions, the FDA can take action, including implementing civil and criminal penalties.

Bayer released its own statement on the ruling:

Bayer is deeply committed to providing women with safe and effective healthcare options that meet their individual needs, and is dedicated to ensuring the continued safe, effective and appropriate use of Essure as an important option for permanent contraception. As the FDA has repeatedly determined &#x2013; after a rigorous review of the scientific evidence &#x2013; Essure, the only non-incisional option available for those who seek permanent birth control, is a safe and effective medical device that benefits women by providing them with a valuable contraception option.

Public watchdog groups note that it can be difficult to get defective medical devices off the market. &#x201C;Once medical devices get on the market, it&#x2019;s extremely difficult to get them off the market, even in the face of evidence suggesting that either they&#x2019;re ineffective, or worse causing harm,&#x201D; says <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-block-essure-contraception-fda_us_5abe8ec0e4b0f112dc9c2e69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Carome</a> of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.

BODY:
Documents published by the website Jalopnik show documents dating back nearly two decades from Goodyear, showing their G159 RV tire has been linked to more than 700 complaints&#x2014;including hundreds of crashes, dozens of injuries, and nine deaths.

The expose called the tire &#x201C;<a href="https://jalopnik.com/goodyear-knew-of-dangerous-rv-tire-failures-for-over-20-1824997252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the worst tire made in history</a>,&#x201D; with documents from 1996 to 2015 pointing to a deliberate cover-up of safety issues with the tire. Legal documents and evidence disclosed for the first time in an Arizona court on April 4, 2018 also show lawsuits against the company, alleging it knew its secrecy about the tire&apos;s dangers would result in future injuries and fatalities. More, after nearly 20 years of reports of injuries and fatalities, the G159 tire is still on the road, possibly still playing a part in serious car accidents.

After the tire was cited in more than 40 lawsuits, the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA) began <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2017/INOA-PE17009-5650.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigating</a> the tire in 2017. According to the Jalopnik article, Arizona judge John Hannah unsealed the documents relating to the investigation and lawsuits after ruling that the potential risk to public health outweighed the risk of confidentiality. Although Goodyear threatened Jalopnik with legal action if they published the documents, Judge Hannah ruled that Jalopnik could go ahead with their article.
<h2>Goodyear&apos;s failure to disclose and secret settlements</h2>
The G159 tire was installed on motorhomes and RVs beginning in 1996. These vehicles typically drive at highway speeds at 65mph or above. However, according to many of the lawsuits, at high speeds, the G159 tires generate internal temperatures of over 250 degrees, which causes them to blow out. A blowout at highway speed can cause serious accidents with property damage, injury, or fatalities.

Many of the lawsuits, along with public safety advocates, allege that the G159s were originally designed for delivery trucks, and not vehicles that typically travel at highway speeds. Yet the court documents show that Goodyear failed to even conduct high-speed tests on the tires until months after sales began. And in these tests, the first few failed at 75mph. Goodyear did not release the results of these tests, instead blaming them on user error.

In the report, Goodyear wrote, &#x201C;Tire blowouts can be related to a number of facts, however the key ones being overload, under-inflation, vehicle speeds and road hazards.&#x201D; It appears Goodyear was suggesting that over 700 claims of blowouts and injury were due to user error.

According to court documents, the tires failed in all positions on the vehicle&#x2014;front, inner, outer, and rear. The tire failed across 39 separate models in 17 brands of motorhomes, and almost every failure occurred at highway speed. The documents show that the NHTSA started receiving reports regarding the safety of the tire more than 15 years ago, but the data was sealed via confidentiality agreements.

By 2006, Goodyear had about 74 casualty claims and dozens of lawsuits against them from around the company. However, when the NHTSA reached out to them, they only disclosed about seven injuries. Moreover, they were aware of about 450 crown separation issues with their tires that resulted in property damage claims. They reported only 58 to the NHTSA.

When a company settles claims regarding defective products behind closed doors, or via confidentiality agreements, or distorts and hides evidence, they put consumers at risk. Up until now, Goodyear was able to hide the safety risks of its dangerous RV tire from the general public. However, the NHTSA is now taking a closer look.

While this case is in progress, if you drive a motorhome or RV, check your tires to ensure you don&apos;t have G159s. If you&apos;ve suffered a catastrophic injury as a result of these tires, either from your vehicle or someone else&apos;s, please get in touch with us for advice.

BODY:
At-home DNA tests are all the rage lately. Simply provide a sample of your DNA, typically saliva, mail it to a company, and in a few weeks you&apos;ll receive a report of your ethnic makeup and information about your family tree. For most people, it&apos;s a fun way to find out more about their family histories. Lately, however, darker stories are emerging about people discovering more than they expected to.

At the end of March, a 36-year-old woman named Kelli Rowlette filed a lawsuit against a fertility doctor after using a popular DNA testing kit&#x2014;and finding out he used his own sperm to impregnate her mother.

Rowlette, from Washington, sent a DNA sample to Ancestry.com and discovered that her biological father was actually her parents&apos; fertility doctor, now-retired Dr. Gerald E. Mortimer of Idaho Falls, Idaho. She is now suing Mortimer for alleged medical negligence, battery, and fraud.
<h2>The doctor &#x201C;cried&#x201D; when the family moved</h2>
In the early 1980s, Rowlette&apos;s parents, Sally Ashby and Howard Fowler, went to Mortimer when they were having trouble conceiving. According to court documents, Mortimer diagnosed Ashby with a tipped uterus and Fowler with a low sperm count. Mortimer recommended Ashby undergo a fertility procedure where she would be inseminated with a mix containing 85 percent of Fowler&#x2019;s semen and 15 percent from a donor. The couple agreed to the procedure, and chose the donor sperm from a tall college student with brown hair and blue eyes&#x2014;similar in appearance to Fowler.

However, as Rowlette would discover after receiving the results of her DNA test, Mortimer actually used his own sperm to inseminate Ashby, while telling her he was using the mixture of her husband&apos;s and the donor&apos;s sperm. Ashby became pregnant in August 1980 and continued visiting Mortimer for post-natal care. She and her husband later conceived a son without medical assistance.

The lawsuit also states that when Ashby told Mortimer the family was going to be moving to Washington, the doctor &#x201C;cried.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Dr. Mortimer knew Kelli Rowlette was his biological daughter but did not disclose this to Ms. Ashby or Mr. Fowler,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4431339-Rowlette-et-al-v-Mortimer-et-al.html?sidebar=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the complaint says</a>. &#x201C;Dr. Mortimer fraudulently and knowingly concealed his use of his own genetic material in the Procedure.&#x201D;
<h2>She thought the results were flawed</h2>
When Rowlette received her results from Ancestry.com, it listed Mortimer as her biological father. She did not know the name, and was &#x201C;disappointed&#x201D; in the results, assuming they were flawed. When she showed her parents, however, they were familiar with Mortimer&#x2019;s name, and were devastated.

The couple reportedly feared their daughter&apos;s reaction and were still contemplating what to do when Rowlette found her birth certificate in October 2017 with Mortimer&#x2019;s signature on it&#x2014;and all the pieces fell together.

In addition to Mortimer, the lawsuit also names Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates in Idaho Falls as a defendant. Rowlette&apos;s parents are also plaintiffs.

If you or a member of your family have been a victim of medical negligence, we can help.

A recent <a href="http://www.wjbf.com/featured/the-means-report/advancements-in-treating-traumatic-brain-injury/1033945049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with two doctors from Medical College of Georgia delved into their research on traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and how a popular blue food dye might help patients heal more quickly. Dr. John Vender, the Vice Chair of MCG&apos;s department of neurosurgery, and Dr. Krishnan Dhandapani, an MCG neuroscientist, spoke to The Means Report in Augusta in March.

When a patient suffers a moderate to severe head or brain injury, it can lead to immediate swelling around the brain. Researchers had previously discovered that a water channel in the brain, called aquaporin 4, leads to edema, which is swelling or water on the brain. Dr. Dhandapani explained that he and his team looked for potential molecules that might block that water channel and prevent the edema event. They searched medical literature going back 40 years and discovered some correlative data suggesting that ingesting a certain type of dye could decrease swelling in certain indications.

They tested the dye in a pre-clinical traumatic brain injury model, and it worked. In these models, it brought down swelling and improved outcomes. In particular, the dye blocked one inflammatory called interleukin 1 beta. Dr. Dhandapani noted that interleukin 1 beta appears to be a biomarker, in that TBI patients with elevated levels of interleukin 1 beta typically have a worse prognosis with more brain swelling. And the blue dye? It&apos;s a &#x201C;cousin&#x201D; of FD&amp;C blue dye #1&#x2014;found in foods like blue M&amp;Ms and blue Gatorade.

The ultimate goal of &#x201C;blue dye&#x201D; treatment would be to prevent the processes that spiral out of control after a brain injury. When the brain swells, the inflammation causes brain compression, which causes loss of blood flow to the brain, which causes cell injury, and then additional swelling.

Dr. Vender explained that part of his job is treating brain injuries in the most acute stage&#x2014;the three- to five-day window where the brain is at its most vulnerable. He spoke about how doctors can relieve brain swelling by draining cerebrospinal fluid or even cutting a hole in the skull to relieve pressure. It&apos;s possible Dr. Dhandapani&apos;s research could help him with his patients. Although &#x201C;blue dye&#x201D; treatment is still in pre-clinical stages and hasn&apos;t reached clinical trials, the goal is to stop the swelling from happening in the first place.

Hypothetically, a brain injury patient would be able to receive the dye, in the form of IV injection, as soon as possible after the injury occurs. Currently, researchers are using mice models with promising results.
<h2>More about traumatic brain injuries</h2>
It&apos;s important to remember that, just like every person, no two brain injuries are alike. Effects of the injury as well as recovery time, can be completely different for everyone. Someone with a serious TBI might suffer from severe cognitive issues or other extreme symptoms like coma or blood coming from the ear or nose. Those with moderate TBIs can experience lesser, yet still serious, symptoms like headaches, memory loss, depression, mood swings, or difficulty concentrating.

Some might resolve in weeks, but some effects of brain injuries can last for months, years, or for life. And although some TBIs show up on CT scans or MRI, some don&apos;t show up at all and can only be detected through cognitive and visual testing. This is why it&apos;s crucial you don&apos;t ignore any injury to the head, even if it doesn&apos;t seem that serious.

A <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193635" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish study</a> published on March 21 in the <em>Public Library of Science</em> found that children diagnosed with brachial plexus birth injuries have a higher risk of developing mental health issues as a teenager, according to an <a href="https://psychcentral.com/news/2018/03/23/nerve-related-birth-injury-tied-to-greater-risk-for-poor-mental-health-in-teens/134033.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> from PsychCentral. Researchers from Lund University in Sweden analyzed data on 600,000 Swedish teens and discovered that more than 1,600 with brachial plexus palsy used anti-depressants and other medications for mental health issues more frequently than their peers.

Further, the researchers found that kids with brachial plexus injuries from low-income families also have a greater chance of developing mental health issues than their peers from higher-income families. Overall, teenage girls were more affected, but the risk of mental health issues became even higher for girls from low-income backgrounds.

The lead author of the study, Elia Psouni, associate professor of developmental psychology at Lund University in Sweden, told PsychCentral, &#x201C;Coming from a family with low socioeconomic status is a high risk in itself. If you are also a girl, the risk that you will suffer from poor mental health is more than twice as high than if you are a boy from a wealthy family.&#x201D;

Research already shows that a child&apos;s socioeconomic background can have an effect on whether or not they develop a mental illness. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3482020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012 study</a> from <em>The American Journal of Public Health</em> showed that the link between mental health disorders and socioeconomic background might mostly be driven by perceived social status. It&apos;s also important to note that children raised in low-income households may receive less support and have less access to social services.
<h2>Birth injury&apos;s impact on mental illness</h2>
So why did the study find that the impact of brachial plexus injury on mental illness affect girls more than boys? Psouni posits that &quot;it has to do with trauma and discrimination on many levels,&#x201D; and added, &#x201C;In my previous research, I have seen how the experiences and consequences of school-related stress are greater in girls than in boys.&#x201D;

Brachial plexus injury is one of the more common birth injuries, affecting the ability for an infant to flex or rotate their arm. Typically, this injury heals on its own within a few months, but in some cases, &#xA0;it results in permanent nerve damage. Sometimes birth injuries are unavoidable, but there are times it occurs due to medical negligence or malpractice.

Psouni hopes her research will help drive awareness to the long-term effects of brachial plexus birth injuries, and help prepare families and children with these injuries when it comes to mental health in their teen years.&#xA0; She hopes that &#x201C;children will continue to receive help, even after the physical injury has been treated, by a professional team working closely with the patient.&#x201D;

If your child suffered a birth injury like a brachial plexus injury or Erb&apos;s palsy, we can help. The birth injury lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help hold the negligent parties responsible and work to secure compensation to help you take care of your child.

BODY:
In a follow-up to a blog we wrote back in March, an Ohio judge denied a request by lawyers to throw out one of the 45 lawsuits against University Hospitals (UH) by clients whose frozen embryos or eggs were destroyed in a UH fertility clinic in Cleveland. In early March, 4,000 eggs and embryos belonging to 950 families were damaged when temperatures improperly and dramatically rose in one of the clinic&apos;s storage tank&apos;s freezers.

The lawyers requested that two lawsuits, filed by Wendy and Rick Penniman of Broadview Heights, and John and Kristine Brickel of Bay Village, should be thrown out and reclassified as medical malpractice cases. Judge Stuart Friedman denied the motion to throw out the Pennimans&apos; case. He didn&apos;t rule on the Brickels&apos; case, but it&apos;s expected that Friedman&apos;s ruling would apply to all 45 cases, as they have been consolidated into one.

Attorney Tom Merriman, who is representing several clients, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/05/judge_denies_university_hospit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>, &#x201C;The whole reason for consolidation is to give the parties consistency in rulings. The court&apos;s logic in this order (involving the Pennimans), I would assume, would apply to all of the cases, and any additional motions to dismiss the cases on the basis of medical malpractice would fail.&#x201D;
<h2>Medical malpractice or negligence?</h2>
It&apos;s likely UH attempted to have the cases against them reclassified as medical malpractice because those types of cases have caps on potential damages per Ohio law, typically $250,000 to $500,000. Judge Friedman, in his order, said the basis of his decision was whether or not the storage of the eggs and embryos constituted medical care. University Hospital claimed that the storage required medical expertise. Friedman denied that claim and sided with the Penniman&apos;s claim that their case focused only on the UH&apos;s negligence on monitoring the storage tanks.

On June 8, the attorneys for all 45 clients will meet with Friedman for a case management hearing.
<h2>March&apos;s tank failure</h2>
When the freezer malfunctioned sometime between March 3 and March 4, more than 4,000 frozen eggs and embryos were lost. While there was evidence of damage, there is no way to test the embryos and eggs to see if they are still viable without thawing them out first. However, there is no safe way to thaw and then re-freeze the specimens without damaging them.

The Pennimans and Brickels were among the first to file lawsuits against UH, on March 9, about five days after the freezer tank malfunction. If you have any questions about or were affected by the University Hospital Fertility Center incident, get in touch with us today.

BODY:
Burns can be some of the most serious and painful injuries a person can experience. Thousands of people suffer moderate to severe burns each year in the United States, with even more suffering minor burn injuries.

The American Burn Association reported <a href="http://ameriburn.org/who-we-are/media/burn-incidence-fact-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">486,000</a> burn injuries necessitating medical treatment and more than 3,200 deaths from fire and smoke inhalation in 2016. And someone dies from a fire or by smoke inhalation every two hours and 41 minutes.

The path to recovery for those dealing with burn injuries can be long and painful. Even putting aside the physical and psychological pain, the financial burden can be catastrophic. Paradigm Outcomes, a case management company, estimates that&#x2014;in complicated cases&#x2014;severe burns can cost up to <a href="http://www.paradigmcorp.com/blog/treatment-costs-of-severe-burn-injuries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10 million</a> to treat successfully.
<h2>Why is it so expensive to treat burn injuries?</h2>
Minor burns typically heal on their own without any complications if treated correctly. However, moderate to severe burns can affect many systems and tissues in the body, creating multiple medical problems. Managing several problems at once is why burn injuries are so costly to treat. Some of the secondary or related injuries that can result from burns include:
<ul>
    <li>Skin damage</li>
    <li>Nerve damage</li>
    <li>Muscle, ligament, and tendon damage</li>
    <li>Bone damage</li>
    <li>Eye/vision damage</li>
    <li>Contracture (shortening or stiffening of connective tissue)</li>
    <li>Internal organ damage, like the lungs</li>
</ul>
Additionally, catastrophic injuries require multiple medical professionals. For example:
<ul>
    <li>Wound care specialists</li>
    <li>Pain management specialists</li>
    <li>Surgeons (general and reconstructive)</li>
    <li>Therapists (physical, occupational, psychological)</li>
    <li>Social workers to help the patient adjust</li>
</ul>
Other types of expenses might include antibiotics, painkillers, wound dressings, pressure bandages, or blood transfusions. If a patient needs an extended stay in the hospital or in a burn treatment center, that can also add tremendous expense.
<h2>Complications can add even more costs</h2>
When a patient is working to recover from serious burns and complications set in, medical expenses can skyrocket. Unfortunately, complications are common with burn injuries due to the secondary injuries. The Paradigm report also discusses some of the more common complications and their general costs. An abridged list follows:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scarring or disfigurement</strong>, which can add around $35,000 in medical costs. About two-thirds of patients with burns experience these complications.</li>
    <li><strong>Infections</strong> happen to more than one-third of burn victims, and can add $120,000 in treatment costs. Some infections can even cause organ failure.</li>
    <li><strong>Slow-healing wounds</strong> or <strong>skin graft failure</strong> occurs with almost one-third of patients and can cost an additional $110,000 in medical bills.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychological complications</strong> can add up to $75,000 in costs, affecting about 57 percent of patients. This includes post-traumatic stress disorder after a burn injury.</li>
    <li><strong>Fragile skin</strong>, or skin breakdown, occurs in about 55 percent of cases, and can costs a patient over $100,000 in added medical costs.</li>
</ul>
Costs could continue to accumulate for the rest of the patient&apos;s life. A burn injury patient may be disabled for a long period, or even permanently. In these cases, they could lose wages, benefits, or commissions. Depending on the person&apos;s age and circumstances, this is a significant amount of money and is a devastating hit to a person or family.

Burn injuries can happen to anyone at any time. If the injury is severe, the costs can be crushing. If your injury was due to someone else&apos;s negligence, they should be held responsible. Let the injury lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law fight for your right to compensation. We proudly serve clients throughout Ohio and Kentucky. Please call us today at 877-686-8879.

He spent the first two years of his career basically riding the bench, after injuries kept him from playing &#x2013; but thanks to him, the team almost went to the playoffs in 2007. He broke multiple records in 2009 when he was traded to the Bucs, but it wasn&#x2019;t enough. He rode the bench again for the Seahawks in 2012, quit the Patriots after one game, and his career ended on the Jets in 2013.

We&#x2019;re pointing this out because Kellen Winslow Jr. is a well-known name, an extraordinary player, and an alleged criminal: drug possession in 2014 (conditional discharge), felony burglary in early June (on bail) &#x2013; and on June 14<sup>th</sup>, kidnapping and rape.

<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/06/15/kellen-winslow-cte-defense-rape-sexual-assault-charges/707277002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to USA TODAY</a>, &#x201C;In total, Winslow faces nine charges and the prospect of the rest of his life in prison. The gruesome details of the alleged crimes in San Diego County also hint at one possible route his defense could take: Winslow, who spent nine seasons in the NFL, could suffer from the debilitating impacts of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).&#x201D;
<h2>The importance of using CTE as a defense</h2>
First things first: there is still no definitive proof that Kellen Winslow Jr. has CTE. A way of diagnosing living patients may have finally been discovered, but it&#x2019;s still in early stages. There is also no guarantee that the court will allow such a defense to move forward.

But the fact that his lawyers even want to <em>try</em> to use it tells us one very specific thing: <strong>If CTE can be used as a defense for criminal activity by this former football player, then there is no doubt football causes CTE. </strong>

CTE is an insidious disease, and it is entirely preventable. People do not get this condition unless they endure repeated blows to the head &#x2013; even so-called &#x201C;minor concussions&#x201D; can lead to the build of up of tau that is indicative of CTE.
<h2>Parents, please &#x2013; don&#x2019;t let your kids play football</h2>
The research is clear: playing tackle football almost certainly will lead to developing CTE. New research is being done all the time, and your kids are at risk. It might not be the first tackle. It might not be the tenth. But it will happen.

Parents should look at each play in football as their child smoking one cigarette. It slowly causes damage to the child&#x2019;s brain, one play (or one cigarette) at a time.

We know that once your child is 18, then he (or she) is legally an adult and can make decisions on his or her own. We know that there is nothing you can really do to force those decisions one way or the other. We know that kids will be kids, and that they will make choices that are dangerous or bad for them more than once, because everyone at that age thinks they&#x2019;re invincible.

We know you love them.

We know you want to protect them.

We know that sports are always touted as a way to encourage team work, good sportsmanship, a sense of community, and a way to build character.

And we also know that football is going to kill your children. Maybe not on the first play. Maybe not on the 100<sup>th</sup> play. But eventually, it will.

Choose the future. Choose your children. Choose life.

Crandall &amp; Pera Law will always fight to secure a better future: for you and for your children. If your child has sustained a brain injury playing football or another contact sport, we want to help.

BODY:
The spinal cord is a bundle of nerves and tissues that extends from the base of the brain down the length of the back. When the cord is injured or damaged, messages from the brain are disrupted or cut off completely, resulting in partial or total loss of feeling and movement below the point of injury.

According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, approximately <a href="https://www.nscisc.uab.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">288,000</a> Americans currently live with a spinal cord injury. However, a recent study uncovered an unlikely ally in the search for a cure for spinal injuries&#x2014;an endangered salamander.

More specifically, the axolotl, which has an amazing ability to not only regenerate its own limbs, but also heal its own spinal cord in the event of an injury. The axolotl, also known as the Mexican Walking Fish, is native to lakes near Mexico City, and grows to around nine inches in length. It can grow back lost limbs and even replace its lungs and parts of its brain if it suffers a head injury&#x2014;and heals without scarring.

We&apos;ve always known the axolotl had the ability to heal itself in this manner, but a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180423085437.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> from the University of Minnesota has uncovered <em>how</em> they do this, and how humans may be able to replicate the process on themselves.
<h2>Axolotl, heal thyself</h2>
When this little salamander suffers a spinal cord injury, its body jumps into action. Near the site of the injury, nearby cells called glial cells start rapidly multiplying and position themselves to rebuild damaged connections between nerves and the injured spinal cord. In comparison, when a human suffers a spinal cord injury, the glial cells form scar tissue instead, which block the nerves from ever reconnecting with each other.

In their research, the team discovered that a protein called c-Fos is necessary for the regeneration process. Further, c-Fos is found in both salamanders and humans. In humans, however, the protein is prevented from working by another family of proteins called Juns. Juns trigger the scar tissue that prevent the nerves from reconnecting.

But now that they&apos;ve found the common link&#x2014;c-Fos protein&#x2014;scientists are optimistic that if they can create a drug or compound that can switch off the Jun proteins, it will allow human glial cells to grow back injured areas of the spinal cord.

&quot;Humans have very limited capacity for regeneration, while other species like salamanders have the remarkable ability to functionally regenerate limbs, heart tissue and even the spinal cord after injury,&quot; said lead researcher Dr Karen Echeverri, PhD, assistant professor in the department of genetics, cell biology and development at the University of Minnesota.

&quot;We have discovered that despite this difference in response to injury, these animals share many of the same genes with humans. This knowledge could be used to design new therapeutic targets for treating spinal cord injury or other neurodegenerative diseases.&quot;

Spinal cord injuries can be devastating and life-altering. If you or a loved one were in an accident that resulted in paralysis or other type of spine injury, we would like to help. If your accident was due to someone else&apos;s negligence or recklessness, you may be due compensation for your injuries and damages.

BODY:
The umbilical cord is a literal lifeline that connects the fetus to the placenta, providing the growing baby with the oxygen and nutrients it needs to stay alive. The cord plays this essential role through pregnancy, labor, and delivery&#x2014;and once the baby is delivered and able to breathe on its own, the umbilical cord is no longer necessary.

However, in rare cases, there may be issues with the umbilical cord during the stages of pregnancy, labor, and delivery. If these issues aren&apos;t dealt with properly, your baby can suffer a severe birth injury. One of the most serious issues is a prolapsed umbilical cord.
<h2>What is a prolapsed umbilical cord?</h2>
In a normal delivery, the baby exits the birth canal before the umbilical cord. However, in some situations, the umbilical cord drops through the cervix into the vagina before the baby. This usually occurs at the same time as amniotic sac ruptures (water breaking), as the baby moves into the birth canal for delivery.

A <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/complications/umbilical-cord-prolapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prolapsed cord</a> is an emergency because the cord can be compressed or pinched between the baby&apos;s body and the mother, blocking or cutting off completely the baby&apos;s supply of oxygen and nutrients. Without oxygen, the baby can suffer birth injuries like brain damage, or even death.
<h2>How do doctors monitor for umbilical cord prolapse?</h2>
During labor and delivery, the mother&apos;s ob-gyn or midwife should carefully monitor the mother for any signs of abnormalities. This includes a pelvic examination to ensure the umbilical cord hasn&apos;t prolapsed, and this examination should happen regularly as labor keeps progressing. In some cases, the medical professional can visually spot a prolapsed cord.

If at any point the doctor feels there&apos;s cause for concern, they should monitor the fetus carefully to track its heart rate. If the baby shows signs of distress, the doctor should act immediately&#x2014;commonly an emergency cesarean section. Failure to act when the fetus is in distress may be medical negligence.
<h2>What are the risks of a prolapsed umbilical cord?</h2>
There are several risks that can increase your chances of having an umbilical cord prolapse:
<ul>
    <li>If you are carrying more than one baby</li>
    <li>If you have excessive amounts of amniotic fluid</li>
    <li>If your umbilical cord is excessively long</li>
    <li>If your baby is breech or other unusual delivery presentation</li>
</ul>
Your doctor or midwife should have assessed these risks at the start of prenatal care. If you have any of these risks, you should be monitored and advised properly according to your situation. Your doctor might ensure you have ultrasounds to check on your amniotic fluid levels and the length of your umbilical cord before you go into labor, for example.
<h2>What are your rights?</h2>
If your baby was deprived of oxygen during birth because of a prolapsed umbilical cord, you probably want to know why. What if your healthcare provider failed you and your child? Did they monitor you correctly, or warn you of the risks, or respond to evidence of a prolapsed cord? If they didn&apos;t, they may have acted negligently.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, our birth injury attorneys in Ohio and Kentucky have the experience you want on your side. If a doctor or other medical professional has injured your child, you may be entitled to compensation for your medical bills, other expenses, and pain and suffering.

Anyone who owns a car, SUV, or truck is certainly acquainted with recalls. Whether government-mandated or voluntary, most of us have had to take our car back to the dealer at some point to get a faulty part fixed&#x2014;courtesy of the manufacturer.

In some cases, these defects are minor and unrelated to safety issues. In other cases, however, the defect is serious and has potential to cause a car accident, and significant injury, if not repaired.

Recently, the website <a href="https://www.iseecars.com/recall-rates-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iSeeCars.com</a> compiled a list of the most recalled cars and the least recalled cars in the United States. They also cross-referenced the list with reliability ratings on the vehicles. Some of the results might surprise you, as a few models on the most-recalled list have a reputation for superior quality.
<h2>Methodology</h2>
iseeCars collected recall data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&apos;s (NHTSA) database as of May 1, 2018. They calculated recall rates as the number of recall campaigns for each model for model years 2013 to 2017 divided by the age of the model and the model&apos;s new unit sales. They ended up with a set of 69 models, and an overall average recall rate of 0.79 recalls per year per 100,000 new unit sales. Then, each model&apos;s recall rate was compared and ranked with the national average.
<h2>Results</h2>
The most-recalled vehicle in America was unexpected. The Mercedes C-Class came out number one, with a 5.77 recall rate, 7.3 times the national average. The study stated that the luxury vehicle &#x201C;has been recalled for a host of safety issues, from several different recall campaigns involving airbags to multiple campaigns involving failure in the steering column.&#x201D;

An additional recall involved the sunroof, which had been improperly bonded to the frame, meaning it could potentially fall onto passengers. The study also noted that luxury cars like the Mercedes or the BMW 3-Series and 4-Series (third on the recall list) have many extraneous features, and every additional feature is an additional point of potential failure.

The second-most recalled vehicle in the study was the GMC Sierra, with a recall rate of 3.25, 4.1 times the national average. Some of its past safety issues include loss of power steering, faulty seat belts, fuel tanks overfilling, and faulty brake pedals. Other cars and trucks on the most-recalled list include the Dodge Durango, Nissan Pathfinder, Ram Pickup, Toyota 4Runner, Dodge Charger, Chrysler 300, and the Chevrolet Tahoe.

The car with the lowest recall rate in America is the Hyundai Accent with a recall rate of 0.10, 0.1 times the national average. The rest of the list includes Chevrolet Equinox, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Honda CR-V, Honda Accord, Subaru Crosstrek, Toyota Camry, Hyundai Elantra, and the GMC Terrain.

One insight from the iSeeCars report is that models with high recall rates typically have low reliability ratings, and vice versa. However, they found one interesting exception here&#x2014;the Toyota 4Runner. Even though it found itself on the most-recalled list, the 4Runner received a high reliability rating. This is likely because the majority of its recalls were for relatively minor issues like loose accessories, improperly tightened roof racks, or spare tire pressure.

BODY:
It&apos;s a familiar sight on the side of the highway (or sometimes right in the middle of the lane) &#x2013; chunks of tire from an 18-wheeler&apos;s blowout. Blowouts from a truck can cause a hazard for other drivers by scattering debris across the road. They also cause dangerous situations for the truckers themselves by making it difficult to steer their rig to safety.

A tire blowout can happen at any time. These aren&apos;t just flat tires, but an abrupt bursting or rupture of a tire while the truck is traveling at a high speed. This sudden explosion can cause the driver to momentarily lose control of their vehicle, but even a moment is enough to cause a serious truck accident with major injuries for innocent drivers.
<h2>Reasons for truck tire blowouts</h2>
Large commercial trucks have 18 wheels. There are many conditions that could cause one of these 18 wheels to blow out. Some of the most common causes of blowouts include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overheating.</strong> High temperatures inside a tire can cause the pressure inside to increase and the tire can expand and burst.</li>
    <li><strong>Improper tire inflation.</strong> Overinflated tires can become weak and therefore more prone to blowouts.</li>
    <li><strong>Old, damaged, or </strong><strong>defective tires.</strong> Old tires can be structurally weak and suddenly blow out. Damaged tires may be cracked in the seams, and increased pressure could cause them to burst or rupture.</li>
    <li><strong>Tires coming off the rim.</strong> Tires can suddenly come off the rim in a situation called &#x201C;demounting.&#x201D;</li>
    <li><strong>Inadequate or improper maintenance.</strong> The driver or maintenance crew should regularly inspect the truck&apos;s tires to ensure they&apos;re in good working condition.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hazards of truck tire blowouts</h2>
As we said earlier, when a big rig has a tire blowout, the driver may have a hard time controlling their vehicle. Here&apos;s why. Commercial trucks can weigh up to 80,000 pounds. This makes them difficult to stop under the best of circumstances, much less in an emergency situation. Even with a skilled trucker behind the wheel, after a blowout, the truck might swerve, or in the worst cases, even jackknife or roll over.

Other drivers on the road are then put in danger&#x2014;they may also have to swerve to get out of the way of the truck, or out of the way of a flying chunk of tire. Even a small piece of tire can cause a serious accident if it hits another vehicle.

In an effort to improve safety, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) conducted a comprehensive <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/research-and-analysis/large-truck-crash-causation-study-analysis-brief" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Large Truck Crash Causation Study</a> to understand why semi-truck crashes occur. The FMCSA reviewed about 142,000 serious truck accidents that resulted in injuries or fatalities. They determined that 8,000 of these accidents were primarily caused by truck tire blowouts.

Truck and 18-wheeler accidents can be devastating because of their size, and often involve more than one vehicle. If you or a loved one were injured in a truck accident, you could be entitled to compensation for your damages.

BODY:
A Rumpke driver has died after being hit by a passing motorist in Middletown on Monday. David Evans was 52 years old. He had been airlifted to Miami Valley Medical Center in Dayton, where he succumbed to his injuries. The motorist, a 41-year-old man, &#x201C;sustained serious, but non-life threatening injuries and was taken to Atrium Medical Center,&#x201D; per <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2018/07/30/rumpke-driver-hit-critically-hurt-middletown/862250002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cincinnati.com</a>.

At this time, the crash is still under investigation, and no charges have been filed.

Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Mr. Evans, a <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/butler-county/middletown/driver-hits-rumpke-employee-on-middletown-route" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beloved figure in his neighborhood</a> who had volunteered at the Harvest Home Fair for 35 years, per WCPO 9. His death has had a profound impact on the community, and we hope the investigation wraps up quickly, so they might find some closure.
<h2>&#x201C;This is not an isolated incident.&#x201D;</h2>
Mr. Evans had done everything right. As <a href="http://www.fox19.com/story/38764112/rumpke-driver-hit-critically-hurt-in-middletown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOX 19 Now reported</a>, &#x201C;Evans was dressed in appropriate reflective safety gear and all truck safety lights were in operation at the time of the accident.&#x201D; This information has been confirmed by multiple news outlets, quoting Rumpke officials.

Unfortunately, this is not the first time this type of fatal truck collision has occurred. The risk is so great that 247WallStreet.com lists &#x201C;<a href="https://247wallst.com/special-report/2018/03/28/25-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-ta/6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refuse and recyclable material collectors</a>&#x201D; as the 6<sup>th</sup> most dangerous job in America. Per their research, &#x201C;The most common cause of fatalities... is transportation incidents, which account for 67.7% of deaths. While many of these accidents involve the collectors&#x2019; trucks, 29% are classified as &#x2018;pedestrian vehicular incidents,&#x2019; which includes accidents in which a worker is struck by someone&#x2019;s car.&#x201D;

WCPO 9 reported that three different Rumpke drivers were involved in crashes like this about 14 years ago, and a driver named Steve Finch was killed after being hit by a passing motorist. Finch&#x2019;s death spurred the company to push for a &#x201C;slow down to get around&#x201D; law, which would require drivers to slow down and change lanes (whenever possible) when they share the road with waste collection trucks. That led to the creation of <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA132-SB-127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Bill 127</a>, which has passed both the Ohio House and Senate; it is now awaiting a signature from Governor Kasich. If he signs it, Ohio will become the 17<sup>th</sup> state to pass such legislation.
<h2>Protecting sanitation workers in our towns</h2>
The incident that led to Mr. Evan&#x2019;s death may still be under investigation, but we, personally, have seen many cases like this before &#x2013; not just with sanitation truck drivers, but with police officers, firefighters, EMS workers and volunteers, and tow-truck drivers. We have worked with pedestrians and bike riders, and offer assistance to people who have been injured trying to fix a flat on the side of the road, for instance.

In almost all of these truck accident cases, driver inattention or alcohol or drug use is involved. It makes a terrible event even more tragic, because it could have been preventable. We fully support Senate Bill 127, because we know that it can help save lives.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we offer comprehensive representation in courts throughout Ohio and Kentucky. It is our privilege to fight on behalf of injury victims and their families, and to help they secure the compensation they need to protect themselves.

Summer can bring us some of the best weather days of the year. It can also, especially after a harsh winter, bring potholes. Some of these asphalt pits seem to stick around forever, never getting repaired. Whether it&apos;s an oversight by the city, or just that the town doesn&apos;t have enough funds for maintenance, it probably doesn&apos;t matter to you when a pothole damages your car. You just want it fixed.

Oddly enough, an unexpected hero has come to the rescue&#x2014;Domino&apos;s.

A June 15 <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=135383&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2353947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> from the pizza chain announced their new &#x201C;Paving for Pizza&#x201D; campaign, working alongside municipalities to get potholes repaired. Ostensibly, this is to protect the store&apos;s pizzas on their way to customers&apos; homes. &quot;Have you ever hit a pothole and instantly cringed? We know that feeling is heightened when you&apos;re bringing home a carryout order from your local Domino&apos;s store. We don&apos;t want to lose any great-tasting pizza to a pothole, ruining a wonderful meal,&quot; said Russell Weiner, president of Domino&apos;s USA.&#xA0; &quot;Domino&apos;s cares too much about its customers and pizza to let that happen.&quot;

The company is making good on their promise and asking customers to nominate their own towns to win funds for pothole repairs at <a href="https://pavingforpizza.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pavingforpizza.com</a>.

Domino&apos;s has already repaired and filled more than 200 potholes in four cities. So far, they&apos;ve fixed five in Burbank, CA; eight in Bartonville, TX; 40 in Milford, DE; and 150 in Athens, GA. Let&apos;s not be naive, however. This marketing plan isn&apos;t completely selfless. After every repair, workers emblazon the new asphalt with the Domino&apos;s logo and the statement, &#x201C;OH YES WE DID.&#x201D;

Interestingly, though, Domino&apos;s isn&apos;t the first fast food company to try this kind of viral marketing. In 2009, KFC launched a <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/03/fast-food-resturant-will-now-fill-potholes-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketing campaign</a> for &#x201C;Fresh Tastes Best&#x201D; by filling in potholes in several cities across the country. They branded the repaired potholes with the words, &#x201C;Re-Freshed BY KFC.&#x201D;
<h2>Potholes can be hazardous</h2>
Even though the KFC and Domino&apos;s campaigns are publicity stunts on the surface, they actually highlight a growing problem with infrastructure funding in our country. Asking fast food companies to pay for America&apos;s pothole problem isn&apos;t a viable solution, of course, but the Domino&apos;s project did have a positive effect for one community. &#x201C;Facing an already harsher winter than usual for Delaware, this is an opportunity to get additional money to stretch our city&#x2019;s limited resources,&#x201D; <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/dominos-repairing-roads-revealing-troubling-trend-in-spending-2018-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Eric Norenberg</a>, City Manager of Milford, DE.

Road hazards like potholes don&apos;t just create a dangerous ride for your pizza; they create a dangerous situation for anyone unfortunate to encounter them. Potholes, especially large ones, can cause car accidents, cause damage to vehicles, and are a hazard to pedestrians and cyclists.

Domino&apos;s &#x201C;Paving for Pizza&#x201D; initiative is a creative branding opportunity, but it might also force other municipalities to look at their own infrastructure and brainstorm unique ways to fund necessary repairs.

BODY:
Crandall &amp; Pera Law is proud to announce that Kelsey Demeter has been selected for the 2018 Crandall &amp; Pera Law Legal Scholarship. Kelsey is starting her first year at Seattle University School of Law. She recently graduated from Portland State University with a B.A. in Art History. She took multiple courses in both law and political science during her undergraduate years, knowing that law school was her ultimate goal.

For the last few years, Kelsey has worked in a number of law offices, serving as a Department Supervisor as well as a paralegal. During this time, she has assisted attorneys with personal injury lawsuits and Social Security Disability claims, giving her a real understanding of the day-to-day life of an injury victim. She has seen firsthand how difficult life can be for people who are living in pain and struggling to pay their bills because they cannot work. These experiences have fueled her to seek justice on their behalf.

On top of her work and her studies, Kelsey also volunteered. She worked for Portland State University&#x2019;s Student Crisis Hotline before entering college. While in school, she served as the organizer for the Healing the Children of Western Washington Outreach Campaign, the Chairperson of the Adult Indian Adoptee Reunion, and as of January 2018, the CourtWatch Monitor for the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center.

Kelsey&#x2019;s passion for helping others in need, and for seeing that justice is done, is what makes her the ideal candidate for the Crandall &amp; Pera Law Legal Scholarship. She has a big heart, but she is also incredibly well-organized and driven to succeed, as both her grades and her work can attest. We are proud to have selected Kelsey as this year&#x2019;s winner. We expect great things from her.

BODY:
Some surgeons have opened surgery centers, which they own under another corporate name, where they perform risky and major surgeries. This allows the surgeon to not only make money on the surgery, but also the anesthesia and all post-operative nursing care, too. While patients are given a form to sign recognizing this arrangement, most do not realize they are lining their surgeon&#x2019;s pocket as well as having surgery that should normally be performed in a hospital setting, at a surgery center.

Medicare recently announced that it may move to eliminate spinal operations performed at same-day surgical centers from its list of covered procedures. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/07/27/medicare-reconsiders-spine-surgeries-surgery-centers/852156002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to USA TODAY</a>, &#x201C;the review proposal states that Medicare officials will examine whether such procedures &#x2018;pose a significant safety risk&#x2019; to patients and continue to &#x2018;meet the criteria&#x2019; for Medicare payment.&#x201D;

We say, it&#x2019;s about time.

Same-day surgical centers are dangerous, no matter how old the patient is. A USA TODAY/Kaiser Health News investigation from March of 2018 revealed that, since 2013, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/02/medicare-certified-surgery-centers-safety-deaths/363172002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">260 people have died from complications</a> arising from procedures at these types of centers. &#x201C;Some surgery centers are accused of overlooking high-risk health problems and treat patients who experts say should be operated on only in hospitals, if at all. At least 25 people with underlying medical conditions have left surgery centers and died within minutes or days.&#x201D;

The reporters reviewed more than 12,000 Medicare and state inspection records, and interviewed two dozen doctors and administrators, at surgical centers throughout the country. Sometimes, complications arose and there weren&#x2019;t enough personnel on hand to help the patient. Other times, the facilities lacked the appropriate and necessary equipment for emergency procedures. Yet time and time again, doctors and administrators claimed that there were well-known risks associated with these type of in-and-out procedures, and that they were not to blame. Two centers, according to USA TODAY, even blamed the patients themselves.

Now, almost 6 months after that initial USA/KHN investigation, Medicare has started to review these procedures, to see if they really are safe for patients. Per the latest USA/KHN report:

The news investigation found that in 2015 and in 2017, Medicare approved same-day spine operations for seniors even though at least 14 patients had died since 2008 after such procedures.

Some suffocated from a well-known complication of upper-spine surgery that can generally be reversed if caught immediately and treated properly.

The investigation also found that some medical professionals urging Medicare to pay surgery centers to operate on seniors&#x2019; spines failed to mention recent incidents of death at their own or an affiliated facility.

Medicare is not taking comments, and expects to have its final decision by the end of the year.
<h2>This is a personal issue for us</h2>
At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we&#x2019;re watching this process very closely &#x2013; not only because we care about the health of seniors, but because we&#x2019;ve handled cases like this before.

Bill had cervical spine surgery at a Lima, OH surgery center &#x2013; a center that his own operating surgeon owned a significant portion of. While this surgeon called the center a &#x201C;hospital,&#x201D; it was simply a surgery center with minimal staffing, and certainly not a hospital. Bill developed signs of a post-operative blood collection at the surgery location, a complication that later caused his paralysis and loss of bowel and bladder control for the rest of his life. Part of the negligence in this case, is the fact Bill&#x2019;s surgery was done at a surgery center, rather than a hospital, where nurses are better trained, and the facility is better equipped to handle complications after a major operation.

Crandall &amp; Pera Law will always fight on behalf of medical malpractice victims. We applaud Medicare&#x2019;s decision to review which procedures they are willing to cover. Seniors already face additional risks when it comes to surgery; putting their lives in even more risk, just so same-day surgical centers can collect a nice payload, is unforgivable.

If you sustained serious injuries after seeking treatment at a same-say surgical center, or if you have lost a loved one to medical negligence, Crandall &amp; Pera Law is on your side. With offices throughout Ohio and Kentucky, we are always nearby when you need us the most. Please call&#xA0;877-686-8879, or fill out our&#xA0;<a href="/Contact.shtml">contact form</a>, to schedule a free consultation with one of our lawyers.

BODY:
SmartDrive Systems, a company specializing in video safety and transportation intelligence, recently released the results of their latest survey&#x2014;the SmartDrive SmartIQ Speeding Drivers Snapshot for Truckers. The Snapshot aggregates data from their database of over 200 million driving events, which helps fleets understand the risks associated with speeding, and underscores the opportunities to make their fleets safer and improve efficiencies.

The <a href="https://qjfzq2fanlmgxz8x3qlzih10-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SmartIQ_Snapshot_Trucking_Speeding_0418.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SmartDrive Snapshot</a> demonstrates that truck drivers who speed are more likely to take other risks behind the wheel, waste more fuel, and are more at risk for truck accidents. Using video analysis to validate their data, SmartDrive made the following conclusions about truckers who speed. Speeding drivers are:
<ul>
    <li>45% more likely to be involved in a near-collision with another vehicle, and 69% more likely to be involved in a collision</li>
    <li>266% more likely than all other drivers to talk on a handheld mobile phone while driving</li>
    <li>More than 200% more likely to be consuming beverages, food or engaging in grooming or personal hygiene while driving</li>
    <li>More likely to engage in unsafe lane changing, merging, passing, braking and turning</li>
    <li>272% more likely than other drivers to have both hands off the steering wheel</li>
    <li>Nearly three times more likely to practice unsafe following distances</li>
    <li>54% more likely to cross over the median or center line of the roadway</li>
    <li>More likely to disobey stop signs and red lights</li>
    <li>Nearly three times more likely to be distracted while driving</li>
    <li>171% more likely to engage in paperwork while driving</li>
    <li>More likely to waste fuel&#x2014;the highway MPG for speeding drivers is 2.7% lower than all other drivers</li>
</ul>
Another interesting statistic the Snapshot uncovered was that not only is unsafe driving a physical risk, it&apos;s also a financial one. Truck equipment like gears, bearings, clutches, and drive trains all wear out much more quickly at higher speeds. Increasing speed from 50 mph to 60 mph increases maintenance costs by 38%, and increasing that speed up to 70 mph increases costs by 80%.
<h2>Methodology of the study</h2>
SmartDrive calculated the top speeders through ranking their speeding rate. This rate is calculated by using the driver&apos;s &#x201C;speeding score,&#x201D; measured by using four different &#x201C;speeding observations measured through video events,&#x201D; divided by the number of miles driven.

The four different observations are:
<ol>
    <li>Did the driver exceeded maximum fleet speed (did the driver top the company-mandated speed limit for three consecutive seconds)?</li>
    <li>Was the driver guilty of moderate speeding (was the posted speed limit exceeded by up to 10 mph for three consecutive seconds)?</li>
    <li>Was the driver guilty of excessive speeding (was the posted limit exceeded by up to 11 mph or more for three consecutive seconds)?</li>
    <li>Was the driver guilty of extreme speeding (was 85 mph exceeded for 10 consecutive seconds)?</li>
</ol>
This SmartDrive study came out relatively recently, but they consistently and regularly provide this data to their clients. &quot;The clients then have the ability to get this information to analyze and use to their benefit,&quot; <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/eye-on-safety/speeding-study-truck-behaviors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Slaven Sljivar</a>, SmartDrive&apos;s vice president of analytics.

Unsafe truck drivers are a hazard and danger to everyone on the road. If you were injured in a truck accident due to someone else&apos;s negligence, you may be entitled to compensation for your damages.

In a terrible invasion of privacy, a hidden camera was found recently inside a Cleveland Clinic Medina Hospital employee restroom.

According to <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/oh-medina/hidden-camera-medina-hospital-bathroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleveland News 5</a>, the device was discovered in mid-April but it was unknown as to how long it had been in the bathroom. The gender-neutral restroom was private and used by hospital staff only. There was no wireless network or device hooked up to the camera, and any footage caught by the camera remained there. However, there was some footage on the camera when it was discovered, police said.

An employee found the camera in the restroom, and soon afterward another employee was placed on administrative leave. The Cleveland Clinic issued a statement:

&#x201C;We put an employee on administrative leave after a camera was found in a staff-only area. Employees in that area were notified, and we are fully supporting the Medina Police Department in its investigation.&#x201D;

<a href="http://www.cleveland19.com/story/38141746/police-hidden-camera-found-in-cleveland-clinic-medina-hospital-bathroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleveland 19 News</a> reports that the camera looks like the base of a cellphone charger and can be purchased at stores like Wal-Mart for around twenty dollars. A small flashing blue light indicates when the camera is recording.
<h2>Cleveland Clinic plagued with problems</h2>
This is just the latest in a long line of legal woes for the Cleveland Clinic.
<ul>
    <li>In January, a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/05/confidential-deals-can-obscure-sexual-misconduct-allegations-against-doctors-alleged-rape-doctors/868921001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today</a> story revealed the Cleveland Clinic kept a surgeon on staff after he was accused of raping two patients.</li>
    <li>In 2017, <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/doctors-claim-cleveland-clinic-florida-retaliated-over-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five doctors sued</a> the Cleveland Clinic for being retaliated against after they reported that severely ill patients were being prematurely released or &#x201C;dumped&#x201D; to other hospitals.</li>
    <li>In 2014, a neurosurgeon represented by partner Steve Crandall was awarded $7.7 million after eye surgery destroyed his pupil and left him unable to work again.</li>
    <li>In 2008, the Clinic settled a case after a jury awarded the plaintiff nearly <a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/medical/2008/05/jury_had_awarded_more_than_15.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$16 million</a>. The case involved a 6-year-old child who suffered brain damage when he was born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck.</li>
</ul>
The Cleveland Clinic remains one of the top-rated hospitals in the nation. However, that doesn&apos;t preclude its doctors and staff from negligence. The Ohio malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera fight for your rights after a hospital and doctors have failed you. We&apos;ll hold the right people responsible. Call us at 877-686-8879 today.

BODY:
Here in Kentucky and across the country, trucking safety violations pose a huge risk to others on the road. If a truck driver or company fails to maintain their fleet properly, a driver may be unable to stop their vehicle in the event of an emergency or bad weather conditions. And the consequences of being involved in a collision with a tractor-trailer can be devastating, considering the size of the truck compared to the size of a passenger vehicle or motorcycle.

This is one of the reasons the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) will conduct its annual <a href="https://cvsa.org/news-entry/2018-brake-safety-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brake Safety Week</a> this year between September 16 and September 22. In 2017, the CVSA reduced their event to a one-day initiative, but because during that one-day inspection period, 14% of trucks inspected were required to be taken out of service due to brake maintenance issues, they returned the safety inspections to the original weeklong timeframe. The roadside truck inspections will also be ramped up&#x2014;they will be comprehensive Level I inspections, but with a particular focus on brakes and their components.

The brake inspectors are instructed to pay close attention to the following:
<ul>
    <li>Loose or missing brake parts</li>
    <li>Defective rotors</li>
    <li>Air or hydraulic fluid leaks</li>
    <li>Missing warning devices</li>
    <li>Worn-out brake linings, pads, rotors, and drums</li>
    <li>Damaged or mismatched air chambers and reservoirs</li>
</ul>
If a truck is found to have improperly maintained brakes, it will removed from the road until it&apos;s adequately repaired.
<h2>What does the data say?</h2>
The <a href="https://cvsa.org/news-entry/2018-brake-safety-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data and research</a> from CVSA tell a clear story:
<ul>
    <li>According to the U.S. DOT&apos;s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, 32.7% of large trucks with pre-crash violations had brake issues.</li>
    <li>During last year&apos;s International Roadcheck, brake-related violations represented the largest percentage of out-of-service vehicle infractions.</li>
    <li>Large trucks involved in a truck accident where the braking capacity of the truck was critical were 50 percent more likely to have a brake violation than trucks that were involved in crashes where the vehicle&apos;s braking capacity was not critical.</li>
    <li>About 45% of trucks involved in brake-critical crashes had brake violations, in comparison with nearly 30% of trucks involved in similar crashes where braking capacity was not critical.</li>
</ul>
The goal of Brake Safety Week is to reduce the number of crashes caused by badly-maintained braking systems on commercial trucks and vehicles, by conducting roadside &#x201C;fitness&#x201D; inspections and removing dangerous trucks from our roads and highways.

Tractor-trailer and 18-wheeler accidents can cause catastrophic injuries and disabilities. If you were injured in a crash caused by an improperly maintained truck, the Kentucky truck accident lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help. Our legal team will help you pursue compensation for your injuries and hold the guilty parties responsible. Call us today at 877-686-8879.

Sports programs have important benefits for kids&#x2014;improving fitness and coordination, developing teamwork and people skills. However, many popular sports can put children at risk for traumatic brain injury, typically in the form of concussions. Because children are young with developing brains, they are more prone to concussion damage, and studies show that people who suffer concussions at a young age have an increased risk of suffering a second one later.

Of course, we have all heard about the links between brain injuries and youth football, but there are other sports that put our children at risk.
<h2>Youth sports with high concussion rates</h2>
The following popular kids&apos; sports tend to have a higher risk for blows to the head and concussions than others. It&apos;s important to note that not all of these are full contact sports. If your child does suffer a head injury while playing these sports, keep in mind it might be more serious than it appears.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basketball:</strong> A semi-contact sport, basketball doesn&apos;t involve a hard ball (like baseball or softball), making direct contact with the ball using the head, or full-on tackling opponents. However, the game usually does involve flying elbows and knees, collisions, and players even occasionally knocking their heads together during play.</li>
    <li>Like basketball, soccer players don&apos;t wear helmets. Yet, as part of the game, players use their heads to bounce a ball coming at them at a high speed. Repeated blows to the head can cause damage, and soccer is also a contact sport. Kids can collide while running, or hit each other&apos;s heads with elbows, knees, and each other&apos;s heads.</li>
    <li>Gymnastics isn&apos;t a contact sport. In fact, gymnasts don&apos;t even encounter their competitors while engaging in their routines. Yet youth gymnastics has a quickly-growing rate of concussions. Why? Whiplash. Whiplash is proof that a person doesn&apos;t need to have a direct blow to the head to get a brain injury. During practice and training, gymnasts tend to take a lot of falls, and these falls can jerk the neck and head around, which causes the brain to jostle around in the skull. This can cause a mild to moderate concussion.</li>
</ul>
The danger of concussion doesn&apos;t mean parents should discourage or prevent healthy children from participating in sports. Youth sports can be fun and good for kids, and the benefits outweigh the risks. However, if your child does decide to participate in one of these sports, or another sport at risk for concussion, any head injury should be taken seriously. Don&apos;t let your child just &#x201C;walk it off.&#x201D; They may be hurt and should be checked for concussion by a professional.

Sports and childhood should be about having fun. The last thing you and your family should have to worry about is your child suffering from a brain injury. The Ohio and Kentucky lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help you seek compensation if your child was injured on the field due to someone else&apos;s negligence. We want to help.

Having a baby is typically an exciting and hopeful time in a person&apos;s life. Millions of women in the United States give birth every year to healthy babies with no serious medical issues. Unfortunately, that&apos;s not the case for everyone, as a small percentage of women do experience complications.

It&apos;s difficult for a doctor to anticipate certain issues during pregnancy. However, in some situations, a medical professional may fail to identify risk factors or diagnose a condition. If the mother or baby suffers injury as a result of this failure, the doctor or other medical professional could be held liable.

One potentially preventable pregnancy complication is a <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/injuries/uterine-rupture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uterine rupture</a>. Approximately one out of every 1100 births involves a uterine rupture, and almost always occurs in patients who have had prior uterine surgery, typically a cesarean section.
<h2>How does a uterine rupture occur?</h2>
A uterine rupture is when a tear develops in the wall of the uterus. Commonly these tears, ruptures, or complete separations happen at the site of a previous C-section or fibroid tumor removal. These types of surgeries can strain and weaken the uterine wall due to scar tissue.

The risk of experiencing a uterine rupture increases with every cesarean section. Many women are able to have a vaginal delivery after having a C-section, but they should be considered at-risk and be monitored for signs of distress. Women are also more likely to develop a rupture if they have placental abruption.
<h2>What happens during uterine rupture?</h2>
Uterine ruptures typically occur during the early stages of labor. The first symptom is often an abnormal fetal heart rate&#x2014;underscoring the need for constant fetal monitoring during labor. Other symptoms of uterine rupture include abdominal pain, bleeding, rapid pulse, or shock.

In most cases, ruptures are more dangerous for the baby than the mother. If the baby is not delivered quickly following a tear, he or she could suffocate inside the mother&apos;s abdomen. Fortunately, such an outcome is rare, and the mother and baby are usually healthy if doctors act fast. When a baby is deprived of oxygen, it can lead to birth injuries like asphyxia, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and cerebral palsy.

When a woman has a uterine rupture during labor, doctors must deliver the baby via emergency cesarean section. A mother can suffer severe blood loss and may require blood transfusions, surgical uterine repair and, in serious cases, hysterectomy.

Your obstetrician and other medical professionals owe you a duty of care during your pregnancy and delivery. If they fail to provide you this care, including identifying risks for complications, and you or your baby suffered injury, they must be held accountable. The experienced Ohio and Kentucky birth injury lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law are here to help. Call us at 877-686-8879 today.

BODY:
There are certain types of surgical procedures that don&#x2019;t require long hospitals stays. Biopsies and colonoscopies are a good example, because they&#x2019;re same-day procedures that don&#x2019;t require an overnight stay; tonsillectomies, X-Rays, and cataract removals are also same day procedures. As a result, they are often performed at stand-alone surgery centers &#x2013; not hospitals. These centers often cost less money, and are more conveniently located than hospitals, making them popular alternatives.

Right now, there are more than 5600 surgical centers located across the U.S. &#x2013; far more of them than there are hospitals. A USA TODAY/Kaiser Health News investigation in March uncovered <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/02/medicare-certified-surgery-centers-safety-deaths/363172002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 260 patient deaths</a> at these centers in the last 5 years.

One of those deaths was a 12-year-old boy. CBS Evening News tells his story:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s0dfoUMzEOo?rel=0" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>

The latest investigation by USA TODAY has found that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/08/09/surgery-center-deaths-medicare-reporting-colonoscopy/868703002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 states</a> have &#x201C;no mandate to report patient deaths after surgery center care. So no facility oversight authority has examined whether the deaths were a statistical anomaly or cause for alarm.&#x201D; Furthermore:

[These] surgery centers operate under such an uneven mix of rules across U.S. states that fatalities or serious injuries can result in no warning to government officials, much less to potential patients. The gaps in oversight enable centers hit with federal regulators&#x2019; toughest sanctions to keep operating, according to interviews, a review of hundreds of pages of court filings and government records obtained under open records laws. <strong>No rule stops a doctor exiled by a hospital for misconduct from opening a surgery center down the street</strong>. (emphasis ours)

A doctor who has had his or her privileges revoked from a hospital due to misconduct can simply open up a surgical center of his or her own, no questions asked. And that doctor doesn&#x2019;t have to tell anyone, it seems.

When a patient dies in a hospital, that hospital may be required by law to report that death. In some cases, hospitals may be required to report a death to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to the county Medical Examiner (if there is a need for an autopsy), or to the state health department. Not all deaths need scrutiny, but the unexpected ones do &#x2013; like a 12-year-old boy dying from a tonsillectomy, or anyone dying after a colonoscopy, which is one of the safest procedures a person can have.
<h2>Incomplete reports are not limited to deaths</h2>
Understand, too, that this incomplete reporting is not limited to deaths. Per the USA TODAY investigation, &#x201C;Medicare allows surgery centers to report data for as few as half of just their Medicare patients, ignoring most patients under age 65 who do not yet qualify for Medicare. In practice, that has allowed surgery centers to report as many hospital transfers as they choose &#x2013; unless more than half of their patients leave by ambulance.&#x201D;

What this means is, when you do your research into surgical centers, you might see that the Kentucky Surgery Center in Lexington, or the Ohio Surgery Center in Columbus, shows that fewer than half their patients have been transferred to hospitals because of complications. What you <em>don&#x2019;t</em> see is any explanation for why the numbers present the way they do. In a 2013 study published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), researchers looked at patient&#x2019;s &#x201C;acute care needs after care&#x201D; at ambulatory surgical centers. They reviewed records (July 2008 through September 2009) of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114736/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,821,670 surgical patients who were treated at 1,295 ambulatory surgery centers</a> in three states, to determine:
<ul>
    <li>How many were transferred to hospitals at the time of their discharge from the centers; and</li>
    <li>How many people needed hospital-based or Emergency Room care within 7 days of that discharge.</li>
</ul>
They concluded that &#x201C;Among adult patients undergoing ambulatory surgery center care, hospital transfer at discharge is a rare event. In contrast, the hospital-based, acute care rate is nearly 30-fold higher, varies across centers, and may be a more meaningful measure for discriminating quality.&#x201D;

In short, despite low levels of transfers to hospitals, the number of adult patients who sought additional care from the E.R. or through hospital admittance was about 30 times higher than those who did not.

Perhaps most telling, however, is that the transfer rates at the surgical centers across all three states varied very little. Because of this, researchers found, the data &#x201C;may offer little in a patient&#x2019;s or payer&#x2019;s ability to determine which ambulatory surgery centers are providing &#x2018;better&#x2019; care.&#x201D;
<h2>What can be done to protect surgical center patients?</h2>
The NIH study&#x2019;s authors recommend penalties and rewards to incentivize centers to do better. Medicare can issue sanctions, too, for facilities with serious safety lapses. But instead, in July of 2018, Medicare proposed ending its collection of transfer data altogether &#x2013; after all, transfer rates vary so little from facility to facility, and from state to state.

That means it is up to us, as patients and advocates, to force changes for the better. One of the reasons Medicare does not always send officials to investigate problems at surgical centers is that they rely on consumer complaints. Therefore, we must take it upon ourselves to report problems we, or our loved ones, have at these centers. This is especially true for cases concerning minors, as Medicare collects no data on that at all.

The other thing we must do is contact our local and state representatives, and demand that more oversight and regulation be put in place for surgical centers. The owners and operators of these facilities must be held accountable for the mistakes they make, and for their medical negligence. If Medicare and the facilities won&#x2019;t do it, then we need to ensure that other authorities or governing bodies will.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we will continue to fight on behalf of individuals and families whose lives have been turned upside because of medical malpractice. If you or your family member were harmed while undergoing a procedure at a surgical center, we can help.

BODY:
Head-on collisions occur when one motor vehicle impacts another motor vehicle, front to front. The types of crashes often result in the most devastating and severe injuries, including death, due to the multiplied force generated from opposite traveling heavy objects. Statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) indicate that although head-on collisions constitute only 2 percent of all motor vehicle accidents, <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/810631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they account for 10 percent of all auto accident fatalities</a>.

A tragic example of a head-on collision occurred around 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 22 when a southbound pickup drove into the northbound lane of U.S. 41 in Henderson, KY. According to Officer Jennifer Richmond of the Henderson Police Department, <a href="https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/2018/08/22/multi-car-accident-closes-us-41-henderson-expected-delay-4-hours/1069242002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pickup impacted a FedEx semi-truck head-on</a>. The coroner of Henderson County declared the driver of the pickup deceased at the scene.
<h2>Reasons for head-on collisions</h2>
Typically, a head-on crash occurs when one motor vehicle crosses over a median or centerline and impacts another approaching vehicle in the opposite direction. These deadly collisions can also occur when a driver, either on purpose or unintentionally, drives against traffic in the wrong direction or lane. Various activities can instigate a head-on collision, including quickly changing lanes due to a stopped vehicle or approaching construction, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, distracted driving, attempting to pass on a two-lane road, driving with excessive speed and losing control, vehicle malfunction, and roadway defects.
<h2>When a large truck participates in a head-on collision</h2>
The velocity and weight of the vehicles involved in a head-on collision contribute significantly to the amount of damage sustained by each vehicle and the vehicles&#x2019; occupants. In cases when a medium or large size truck impacts a passenger vehicle, which often occurs due to distracted driving, intoxication, or sleep deprivation, occupants of the passenger vehicle will often sustain life altering injuries or even death.
<h2>Injuries often sustained in head-on collisions</h2>
The injuries sustained in head-on collisions often include spinal cord injuries leaving the individual with paraplegia or quadriplegia, serious head and brain injuries, damage to internal organs, and multiple fractures to bones throughout the body.
<h2>Taking a car accident case to trial</h2>
Attorneys who routinely handle litigation involving head-on crashes generally have extensive knowledge of the numerous factors and causes related to these accidents. It is important to have an attorney who understands how head-on collision claims for compensation are litigated. Often, it is necessary to secure expert testimony from professionals in the fields of accident reconstruction and biomechanical engineering in order to establish the negligence of a particular driver deemed by the plaintiff as responsible for the accident. Attorneys helping clients file these cases must also have the necessary resources to retain experts in different economic and medical fields in order to effectively present the damages imposed upon the victim as deserving of proper compensation.

Unfortunately, unsafe drivers travel the roads and highways with all of us each day. If you have been injured in a head-on crash with a truck or other motor vehicle due to the negligence of another party, you may have the right to compensation for your losses. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we are here to help you move forward and recover the financial resources you deserve.

BODY:
Pregnant women can suffer from a disorder that is characterized by a rapid increase in blood pressure. Referred to as preeclampsia, the condition can occur during pregnancy and also during the weeks after delivery. Preeclampsia occurs in approximately <a href="https://www.preeclampsia.org/health-information/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 to 8 percent of pregnancies in the U.S</a>. It is particularly threatening to the life of the mother and her baby if medical care professionals failed to diagnose and treat the condition promptly and correctly. The consequences of untreated preeclampsia can include stroke, seizure, and the failure of multiple organs.

Yet preeclampsia does not get the attention it so rightfully deserves, as a recent <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/deadly-deliveries/2018/07/26/preeclampsia-high-blood-pressure-maternal-mortality-rates/546966002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA TODAY investigation revealed</a>. That may be changing, however; not only did the paper&#x2019;s in-depth report on maternal mortality rates spark a national conversation, but pop superstar <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/beyonce-september-issue-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyonc&#xE9;&#x2019;s recent interview with <em>Vogue</em></a>, where she talked about her own experienced with toxemia (another name for preeclampsia) made international headlines.

If it takes a diva to bring attention to an issue that is injuring and killing pregnant women here and abroad, then we are grateful to Beyonc&#xE9; for her candor. Her story might just save lives.

</ul>
<h2>Diagnosing a dangerous condition</h2>
Many doctors do understand the signs and symptoms that indicate preeclampsia, such as sudden weight gain, swelling of the feet, hands, and limbs, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/during-pregnancy#complications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood pressure in excess of 140/90</a>, blurry vision, headaches, and protein in the mother&#x2019;s urine. However, many times women report limited symptoms and there is no specific diagnostic test for preeclampsia at this time. As a result, the detection of this condition can be quite challenging for medical professionals.

However, obstetricians do have a responsibility to detect preeclampsia and there are steps they can take to effectively diagnose the condition. When doctors fail to make a proper diagnosis, they can be held responsible for medical malpractice.

Particular risk factors should alert doctors that particular symptoms a woman exhibits may be associated with preeclampsia. Some of these risk factors include:
<ul>
    <li>Women below 18 or over 40</li>
    <li>First-time pregnancy</li>
    <li>Obesity</li>
    <li>Personal or family history of preeclampsia</li>
    <li>Pregnant with multiples</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/complications/high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preeclampsia</a> tends to occur around the 20th week of pregnancy. Therefore, doctors should be alert during this time for any symptoms indicating this condition, including high blood pressure, protein in the urine, as well as other potential indicators.

Although preeclampsia is not detected by a single test, more frequent prenatal visits and monitoring of the woman&#x2019;s blood pressure can help increase the likelihood of detection. Doctors should develop a treatment plan for managing the disorder and making sure patients understand the importance of proper preeclampsia management.

Some of the features of a preeclampsia treatment plan can include multiple blood pressure checks each day, visits to the hospital for care, bed rest, and blood pressure medication. In certain cases, it may be best for the mother to remain in the hospital until delivery so she can receive the proper number of urine and blood pressure checks as well as a magnesium sulfate drip &#x2013; all of which may help prevent the onset of eclampsia.

As well, in the hospital it is easier for medical professionals to determine if an emergency cesarean section or inducement of labor is necessary for the health of the mother or baby.
<h2>Course of action after a failure to diagnose preeclampsia</h2>
Medical malpractice may concluded from a misdiagnosis of preeclampsia if the doctor failed to provide the expected standard of care another physician in the same or similar situation and circumstances would reasonably be expected to provide. As well, if the condition was diagnosed, but the doctor failed to apply proper treatment measures to protect the health of the mother and baby, resulting in harm to either, a claim of medical malpractice may also apply.

A mother suffering from preeclampsia is at-risk, and so is her child. If you or your baby has suffered this condition due to a misdiagnosis or inadequate care, the Kentucky and Ohio medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law are here to help you secure the justice and compensation you deserve.

BODY:
Remember those medical review panels that a Franklin Circuit Judge deemed unconstitutional in October of 2017? That case has moved on to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which means the law still stands at this time.

Under Kentucky law, persons desiring to file a medical malpractice claim must submit their claim first to a review panel before it is filed in a formal court proceeding. The job of the panel is to determine if the case has sufficient merit to go to court. However, the evidence suggests that the law, with only one year on the books, is <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2018/08/05/kentucky-medical-malpractice-screening-panel-falls-flat/865452002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing excessive case delays</a>.

Of course it is. We knew it would.

    <li>Kentucky Legislation to Establish Medical Review Panel</li>
    <li>Kentucky&#x2019;s Senate Bill 6 Can Only Harm Injury Victims</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Medical Review Panel Act</h2>
Entitled the Medical Review Panel Act, and passed by Kentucky&#x2019;s House and Senate in 2016, the law is leading to significant delays for individuals seeking to file medical malpractice claims in court.

The panel to which individuals must submit their medical malpractice claims consists of three voting health care professionals and one nonvoting lawyer. Doctors and other professionals are mandated to serve on the panel if requested (unless they are able to offer sufficient reasons otherwise) and are compensated $300 for their expertise and time. The panel is to review the evidence submitted and decide if the expected standard of care in the case was not provided and also led to the patient&#x2019;s injury. The panel&#x2019;s conclusions, although not binding, may be used in court.
<h2>Statistics of cases filed before review panels</h2>
Since the law was put into effect, the panel has received 531 claims. Among these, 58 claims have been examined, 18 are pending, and 13 have been adjudicated. Another 27 have been settled, withdrawn, or dismissed. This leaves 89 percent of claims yet to be addressed by the panel.

While many of those who originally supported the law continue to support the idea of a medical review panel, a number of professionals, including lawyers, have concluded the process to be ineffective. This includes lawyers who represent hospitals, doctors, and nursing homes.

Betsy Johnson, president of the Kentucky Association of Health Care Facilities, an organization that represents nursing homes, stated, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to deny that the numbers aren&#x2019;t good and it is an imperfect law.&apos;&apos;

The establishment of these medical review panels is expected to lengthen the time involved with resolving a medical malpractice case from an average of two years to as many as three or four years.

The idea of medical review panels was once prevalent in states across the nation, with almost 2/3 of all states implementing these panels. However, currently only 17 states operate these panels due to their lack of effectiveness. We believe it is time that Kentucky join that ever-growing list of states which have eliminated the laws. All it does it hurt medical malpractice victims twice.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7754" src="https://www.injuryverdicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Webp.net-resizeimage-1-300x200.jpg" alt="The Dangers of Sharing the Road with Large Commercial Trucks" width="300" height="200">It was 3:41 AM on Interstate 76 eastbound, close to the Barber Road overpass. Norton police responded to an <a href="https://www.barbertonherald.com/2018/08/22/truck-fire-blocks-interstate-76/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accident that left a semi-truck ablaze</a>. The truck was positioned in the left contra-flow lane of a construction zone. According to police, the driver of the rig was traveling to New York from Chicago and carrying 20,000 pounds of plastic. The truck hit the actuator and the concrete barrier.

Commercial truck accidents are some of the most dangerous and destructive crashes on the road today. The reasons are somewhat obvious. A semi-truck, fully loaded, can weigh up to 80,000 pounds. Many passenger vehicles weigh little more than 3000 pounds. The impact between these two types of vehicles leaves a passenger vehicle with a huge disadvantage. As well, a semi-truck or tractor-trailer&#x2019;s weight makes them inherently difficult to maneuver safely when quick action is needed to avert obstacles or travel through tight situations. In addition the stopping distance of a big rig is considerably longer than for small passenger car.
<h2>Sobering annual truck crash statistics</h2>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statistics show that each year approximately 4000 motorists die due to accidents involving large trucks (including medium and heavy trucks, but excluding motorhomes and buses), with about 100,000 people seriously injured in these accidents. Of the fatalities, about 17 percent are occupants of the truck and 83 percent are passenger vehicle occupants.
<h2>The size and height of large trucks</h2>
In a large truck accident, the force with which tractor-trailers can impact the average vehicle is due to their 10 to 20 time weight advantage. In addition, the height of these trailers allows many smaller cars to fit underneath the lower edge of the trailer causing an impact directly into the windshield which can easily result in severe traumatic injuries and even death.

Adding to the existing dangers mentioned above regarding truck size and weight, many truck drivers are forced to deal with lengthy hauls encompassing thousands of miles that leave them on the road are too long without proper time for sleep. Although many federal and state regulations are in place that mandate drivers get the sleep they need, situations exist in which trucking companies and drivers fail to follow these regulations for the purpose of making deliveries on-time and meeting the company&#x2019;s bottom line. This can lead to fatal truck accidents. Tired and distracted truck drivers present a real danger to themselves and others on the roads and highways across the nation.

The impact of large truck crashes involving semis and 18 wheelers can be especially devastating to occupants of passenger vehicles involved in the accident. If you or someone you love has suffered injuries in a truck accident involving the negligence of the truck driver or trucking company, you may have the right to obtain compensation for your injuries and other losses.

BODY:
Travis Barker, drummer for famed rock band Blink-182, is having a terrible year. Back in June, Barker was admitted to the hospital for blood clots in his arms, forcing the postponement of the band&apos;s planned residency in Las Vegas. After being diagnosed and treated, he was re-admitted a few days later with complications related to a staph infection (cancelling even more shows).

Several weeks later, Barker, his teenage son, and a friend were in a car accident in California. A school bus allegedly ran a red light and crashed into their car. The three were able to escape without injury.

However, on September 6, the band announced it was cancelling its fall tour as well as its headliner performance at Riot Fest in Chicago in mid-September due to Barker&apos;s ongoing physical issues.

Barker released a statement regarding his health problems. &#x201C;The past few months have just sucked as I have been sidelined just waiting for my doctors to clear me so I could get back on the road and perform with my band,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, the risks associated with drumming are still too great. I am doing everything I need to do so I can get back on the road as soon as possible. I want to thank my fans, family, friends, and bandmates for all the love and support.&quot;
<h2>Barker believes malpractice is responsible</h2>
After enduring both accidents and cancellation of the band&apos;s tour, Barker has taken legal action against Medical Imaging Center in Santa Monica, California for medical malpractice. After being diagnosed with blood clots, Barker received a routine MRI at the Center. According to <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/09/travis-barker-nerve-damage-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, he was to be sedated before the procedure, but technicians were unable to find a vein. The lawsuit alleges the technicians stuck him at least 40 times in the arms with a dirty needle, ultimately causing nerve damage and the development of a staph infection.

Barker filed an additional lawsuit against both the school bus company and the driver who hit his car in July. His 14-year-old son, who was with Barker in the vehicle at the time of the crash, is also part of the lawsuit.

Barker hasn&apos;t specified the amount of damages he&apos;s seeking. As of this writing, neither Medical Imaging Center or the school bus company have commented on the lawsuits.
<h2>Medical malpractice basics</h2>
Medical malpractice happens when a medical professional fails to meet the standard of care while treating a patient. Put simply, this is when the professional fails to act reasonably, resulting in injury to the patient. Medical professionals can include doctors, surgeons, nurses, dentists, chiropractors, pharmacists, obstetricians, and more.

Injured patients may also bring legal action against the hospital, clinic, practice, nursing home, or other medical institution that employed the responsible party or parties.

To prove a medical malpractice claim, an injured patient must be able to prove that:
<ul>
    <li>There was a relationship between the medical professional and the patient, which establishes a duty of care.</li>
    <li>The medical professional breached the duty of care.</li>
    <li>The patient was injured as a result of that breach.</li>
</ul>
What this means is that the patient must have suffered some kind of injury. If a doctor makes a mistake but causes no harm, there&apos;s no claim to be had. However, often, medical negligence can cause serious and life-altering injuries, or wrongful death.

Injured patients may be able to recover the following in compensation:
<ul>
    <li>Medical bills</li>
    <li>Lost wages and income</li>
    <li>Pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement</li>
</ul>
If you believe you&apos;ve been injured due to medical malpractice, the lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera can help.

On September 20, Nissan North America issued a recall for over 215,000 models over concerns that the anti-lock brake may leak fluid onto an internal circuit board, increasing the risk of a fire. The recalled models range from 2015 to 2018.

The recall covers the:
<ul>
    <li>2015-2017 Nissan Murano</li>
    <li>2016-2017 Nissan Maxima</li>
    <li>2017-2018 Nissan Pathfinder</li>
    <li>2017 Infiniti QX60</li>
</ul>
In some cases, Nissan is advising drivers to park their vehicles outside.

Documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration stated that the ABS actuator pump seal could leak brake fluid onto the internal electronic circuit board, which could cause a malfunction. If this happens, the ABS warning light will illuminate on the dashboard panel to warn the driver about the malfunction. However, if the driver ignores this warning and continues to operate the vehicle in this condition, the leak could actually create an electrical short in the actuator circuit. And, in rare instances, this can start a fire.

Nissan goes on to advise that if the ABS light stays on for more than 10 seconds, to park the vehicle outside, away from any structures or other vehicles, and not to drive it until the issue is fixed. Vehicle owners should contact Nissan Roadside Assistance to have their vehicle towed to a Nissan service department.

It&apos;s estimated that about 56 percent of affected vehicles have the leak, which Nissan has traced to a faulty seal in the pump. However, they have not reported any fires related to the recall.

Any affected vehicle owners will begin receiving notifications from Nissan beginning October 15, 2018. Then, car dealers will inspect and replace the pumps as needed, free of charge.

If you want to check your own vehicle for recalls, the NHTSA maintains a website where you can search active recalls via VIN <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Or, if you want to sign up for safety alerts for your car, you can sign up on the NHTSA site <a href="https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
<h2>Your quick recall details</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vehicles recalled:</strong> 2015 to 2017 Nissan Murano, 2016 to 2017 Nissan Maxima, 2017 to 2018 Nissan Pathfinder, and 2017 Infiniti QX60.</li>
    <li><strong>The issue:</strong> A seal in the ABS actuator pump could allow brake fluid to leak onto a computer circuit, causing a potential electrical short and fire.</li>
    <li><strong>Check if your vehicle is recalled:</strong> Plug in the 17-digit VIN at the NHTSA. It will tell you whether your vehicle has any open recalls.</li>

BODY:
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may substantially increase the risk of suicide, according to a new study outlined in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). According to the study, which utilized the Danish Cause of Death registry, of the approximately 7.5 million people living in Denmark, <a href="https://media.jamanetwork.com/news-item/traumatic-brain-injury-may-be-associated-with-increased-risk-of-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death by suicide occurred among more than 34,500 between 1980 and 2014</a>. As well, about 1 in 10 of those who took their own lives had previously suffered a TBI.
<h2>Factors predicting the risk of suicide</h2>
Trine Madsen, one of the prime authors of the study, stated that the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/08/14/a-traumatic-brain-injury-may-increase-the-risk-of-suicide-study-says/?utm_term=.7633f4cdcbe4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suicide risk increased by 81 percent</a> among individuals who had experienced mild TBI, including concussions. Persons with even more severe brain injuries had an elevated suicide risk, equivalent to twice that of an individual with no prior brain injury. The risk of suicide in individuals was predictable by three definitive factors:
<ul>
    <li>Severity of the brain injury</li>
    <li>Receiving an initial brain injury as a young adult</li>
    <li>Discharge from the hospital for brain injury in the previous six months</li>
</ul>
The study also suggests the risk is present in those who have sustained a TBI in childhood.

Of those without a history of traumatic brain injury, the suicide rate was 20 in 100,000 persons per year. This is compared to 41 in 100,000 persons per year among those having sustained a brain injury. Trauma to the brain can severely impact the brain&#x2019;s ability to function properly, which may lead to mental complications and increase an individual&#x2019;s risk for suicide.

The authors of the study indicate their estimations are most likely conservative due to the fact that mild TBIs, including concussions, were by and large undiagnosed prior to the mid-1990s. As well, many people who were injured playing contact sports such as hockey and football never received treatment for their injuries.
<h2>Potentially life-altering head injuries</h2>
Many of the most frequent causes of TBI injuries include:
<ul>
    <li>Falls</li>
    <li>Auto accidents</li>
    <li>Participation in contact sports and activities (i.e. football, hockey)</li>
    <li>Acts of violence</li>
</ul>
Mild TBIs, such as concussions, can potentially result in lifelong health complications, including a reduction in cognitive performance.

If you have sustained an injury to the head, regardless of what action or activity caused the injury, it is vital to receive medical care and treatment as quickly as possible. Maintaining follow-up care is also crucial. In the worst cases, brain injuries can significantly debilitate an individual&#x2019;s quality of life over the long-term.

If you have suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of the negligence of another person or entity, such as a careless driver on the road, you have the right to file a personal injury claim against the other party in order to secure financial recovery for your damages. Any potential settlement may help you pay for your losses, including medical expenses and lost wages. If we cannot reach a fair settlement, we are always prepared to take your case to trial, and fight for your future.

BODY:
The new school year is in full swing and so is sports season. As every new season kicks off new concerns arise about kids and concussions. There is still so little known about how concussions can affect the brain long term, but we are learning more every day. And, to that end, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently released new guidelines for physicians, coaches, and families to follow when children have suffered a head injury or concussion.

These <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/PediatricmTBIGuideline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidelines</a> were published in early September, and exclusively refer to treatment for mTBI, which stands for mild traumatic brain injury. They&apos;re also the first from the CDC that are specific to mTBI in children.

Using the term &#x201C;traumatic brain injury&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;concussion&#x201D; tends to make people take these types of injuries more seriously and get children the help they need. The guidelines also call for medical professionals, parents or caregivers, and coaches to work together to ensure any symptoms and behavior are reported.

&#x201C;The goal of the guideline is to standardize clinical practice and steer clinicians toward what we currently know,&#x201D; said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/well/family/children-concussions-brain-injuries-cdc-guidelines.html">Matt Breiding</a>, of the Traumatic Brain Injury Team at the C.D.C., as well as a co-author on the guideline.

According to the CDC, every year more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0904-tbi-guidelines.html">800,000</a> children receive care for TBI in emergency rooms nationwide. However, until now, there were no guidelines on pediatric mTBI cases. The CDC bases their guidelines on &#x201C;the most comprehensive review of the science on pediatric mTBI to date,&#x201D; using data from 25 years of research.
<h2>The five key recommendations</h2>
The guidelines include 19 sets of recommendations, but the CDC has highlighted five key guidelines:
<ol>
    <li>Do not routinely image patients to diagnose mTBI.</li>
    <li>Use validated, age-appropriate symptom scales to diagnose mTBI.</li>
    <li>Assess evidence-based risk factors for prolonged recovery.</li>
    <li>Provide patients with instructions on return to activity customized to their symptoms.</li>
    <li>Counsel patients to return gradually to non-sports activities after no more than 2-3 days of rest.</li>
</ol>
Deb Houry, MD, MPH, director of CDC&#x2019;s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, explained in a CDC news release, &#x201C;Until today, there was no evidence-based guideline in the United States on pediatric mTBI &#x2013; inclusive of all causes. Healthcare providers will now be equipped with the knowledge and tools they need to ensure the best outcomes for their young patients who sustain an mTBI.&#x201D;

If your child has suffered a blow to the head, talk to their doctor and school about these new guidelines. They should always be checked for any symptoms of brain injury before being cleared to return to activity. The CDC has patient and family resources on their <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/PediatricmTBIGuideline.html">website</a>.

Concussions are brain injuries. Ensure your child receives the proper treatment when they are injured. If your child suffered a traumatic brain injury, talk to the lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law today for skilled and compassionate representation.

BODY:
Also called an epidural abscess, a spinal cord abscess is a potentially fatal infection located on or against the spinal cord. These infections, although rare, can be easily missed by some physicians, leading to catastrophic and lifelong effects on the patient.
<h2>What is a spinal cord abscess?</h2>
A spinal cord abscess (SCA) occurs when the space between the spine and the spinal cord lining becomes infected. A pocket-like area of pus forms in the affected area, which causes swelling and exerts pressure on the cord, resulting in serious health issues. Abscesses can occur in the brain as well.

SCAs are rare, so some doctors don&apos;t test for it, but misdiagnosis or failure to diagnose can lead to devastating and even fatal results. Many abscesses are mistaken for typical back pain and are diagnosed and treated as such.

Many times, patients with an SCA will make several trips to their doctor or emergency room for assistance before receiving the correct diagnosis, but for some patients the damage is already done. Injured patients may want to speak to a malpractice attorney about their personal situation.
<h2>Symptoms of a spinal cord abscess</h2>
It&apos;s crucial to recognize the symptoms of an SCA as soon as possible, as a delayed diagnosis can lead to long-term neurological damage or even paralysis. Symptoms of spinal cord abscess include:
<ul>
    <li>Back pain</li>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Bowel or bladder incontinence</li>
    <li>Difficulty urinating</li>
    <li>Weakness in legs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Diagnosing an SCA</h2>
There are several ways for medical professionals to diagnose a spinal cord abscess, including the following tools:
<ul>
    <li>Blood tests</li>
    <li>MRI</li>
    <li>CT scan</li>
    <li>Fluid sample from abscessed area (lumbar puncture)</li>
</ul>
When caught in time, SCAs are quite treatable. Typically, doctors use antibiotics and/or surgery, depending on the severity of the abscess. However, if the abscess is misdiagnosed or caught too late, the patient can suffer serious injury, and the doctor may be liable for malpractice.
<h2>Complications from undiagnosed SCAs</h2>
Undiagnosed and untreated SCAs can cause many dangerous complications, including:
<ul>
    <li>Meningitis</li>
    <li>Spinal or bone infections</li>
    <li>Chronic back pain</li>
    <li>Irreversible brain and nervous system damage</li>
    <li>Paralysis</li>
    <li>Death</li>
</ul>
Aside from the physical injuries that come with a misdiagnosed spinal cord abscess, patients must also deal with the financial issues. These can include medical bills, physical therapy, lost wages, and long-term therapy and rehabilitation. As a victim of malpractice, a patient is eligible for compensation for these bills.

If you&apos;ve experienced injuries or complications from misdiagnosis of a spinal cord abscess, talk to the experienced Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law. We can help you deal with the devastating loss that occurs when a doctor fails to do his or her job.

The news is full of tragic stories about tractor-trailer accidents with smaller cars. Rear-end collisions, especially, are often fatal for the drivers and passengers of these vehicles &#x2013; even though they&apos;re among the most preventable with the right technology. Yet, as driver technologies improve, accident rates continue to increase. Why?

The Kansas City Star <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article217849815.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that data collected from 2016 shows more than 4,300 deaths from truck accidents &#x2013; a 23 percent increase from 2009. To put it into perspective, John Lannen from the Truck Safety Coalition points out that this would be like two jet liners crashing every month and killing everyone on board. &#x201C;Those should be eye-opening numbers,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;If air carriers or railroads reported similar numbers, there would be national outrage.&#x201D;
<h2>The NHTSA&apos;s failure to mandate</h2>
The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has not yet mandated any changes to trucking regulations or guidelines that could prevent the rear-end truck accidents that kill thousands of Americans every year. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), an independent federal agency that investigates transportation accidents in the U.S., has made repeated recommendations to the NHTSA to take action to prevent trucks from rear-ending other vehicles.

The Star reports that, since the 1990s, the NTSB has made at least 10 recommendations to the NHTSA to implement forward crash avoidance and mitigation systems (like automatic braking and collision warning). However, some 20 years later, the NHTSA has failed to act, either with guidelines or a mandate.

What kinds of crash avoidance tech is available? Is it expensive, or difficult to implement? The Star&apos;s investigation says no. Many new cars today come with automatic emergency braking systems and forward collision warning systems &#x2013; safety technology that the auto industry vows will be standard on all new cars by 2022. So the technology already exists. Some trucking companies are willing to invest the money to add safety technologies to their fleet; however, some are unwilling to spend the extra dollars.

The NHTSA has not commented on why they haven&apos;t followed through on the any of the NTSB&apos;s safety recommendations, but they did provide The Star with a written statement: &#x201C;NHTSA researched early systems from 2013 to 2016, and is currently studying next-generation AEB (automatic emergency braking) technology through a naturalistic driving study using a field operation test. NHTSA expects to complete the critical field operation testing in 18 to 24 months. This research and other information will help inform an agency decision on next steps.&#x201D;

Safety advocates like Jim Hall, former chairman of the NTSB, believes the NHTSA&apos;s priority should be on preventing more deaths right now, rather than focusing on future technologies. &#x201C;Our government has failed to fund safe roads and encourages 80,000-pound trucks on the same highways as families and children in 3,000-pound vehicles,&#x201D; he said. He also questioned why the NTSB doesn&apos;t mandate &#x201C;available technology to provide safety to those who fund the highway system &#x2014; the taxpayer?&#x201D;
<h2>Truck safety technology works</h2>
According to The Star&apos;s report, seven out of 10 rear-end collisions can be avoided with the implementation of collision avoidance systems. And, with emergency braking, trucks can be slowed down to the point where, if a collision occurs, injuries are typically less severe with reduced property damage. For example, many tractor-trailer accidents occur when a driver isn&apos;t paying attention to traffic flow and plows into the back of a car in slowed traffic. Emergency braking systems can mitigate or even prevent these types of devastating rear-end collisions.

If you or a loved one were injured in a truck accident, talk to the Ohio and Kentucky truck accident lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera Law. Our lawyers are experienced in rear-end collisions, underride accidents, and other kinds of truck crashes. We can help you seek compensation for your injuries.

BODY:
We&apos;re all familiar with baby and infant walkers &#x2013; those wheeled contraptions that let babies roll around using their legs before they&apos;re able to walk. If you&apos;re reading this, you probably used one yourself when you were little, or maybe one of your kids did. However, the authors of a recent study urge anyone that still has baby walkers to discontinue using them.

The study, published September 13 in the journal <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2018/09/13/peds.2017-4332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pediatrics</a>, found that more than 9,000 children in the United States are injured each year while using infant walkers. Although the annual number of injuries has dropped dramatically in recent years, the authors of the study believe it&apos;s still too high.

About five kids a day end up in the emergency room with injuries from baby walkers, usually from falling down the stairs and hurting their necks or heads. Children can also suffer what&apos;s called proximity-related injuries, such as pulling on or touching a dangerous object they were able to reach while in the walker. These injuries can be serious, as the authors of the study write, &#x201C;Infant walker-related injuries can be severe and can include skull fracture, brain injury, burns, poisoning, and drowning.&#x201D;
<h2>Pediatricians calling for ban (again)</h2>
Although the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has been warning about the dangers of baby walkers for <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/108/3/790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades</a>, they&apos;ve remained legal in the United States. On the other hand, Canada banned the use of infant walkers in <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/11/20/why-are-baby-walkers-banned-in-canada_n_8609678.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2004</a>.

United States manufacturers added voluntary safety features in the late 1990s, the primary change making the walkers wider than standard 36-inch-wide doorway openings and features to prevent walkers from falling down stairs. Then, in 2010, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) implemented mandatory safety rules that banned non-conforming infant walkers from being imported and sold in the United States.
<h2>Current study and findings</h2>
The last formal study about baby walker safety was performed 10 years ago and the authors of the study wanted to update the data to make future recommendations. &quot;What we set out to do was give a nice summary of what&apos;s happened over the last 25 years to this source of injury to young kids, and specifically to look at the effect of the 2010 change that converted the safety standards of walkers from a voluntary standard to a mandatory standard,&quot; said Dr. Gary Smith, the director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children&apos;s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.

Researchers examined CPSC data on emergency room visits for children under 15 months old. Their analysis showed that, between 1990 and 2014, 230,676 kids were taken to the hospital with baby-walker-related injuries:
<ul>
    <li>74% of injuries resulted from falling down stairs</li>
    <li>14% happened when the walker flipped over, and the baby fell out</li>
    <li>Less than 3% of injuries occurred when the child came into contact with a hot object or other dangerous object they wouldn&apos;t otherwise have been able to reach</li>
    <li>Nearly 5% of children suffered injuries serious enough to require admission to the hospital</li>
    <li>98% of all injuries occurred at home</li>
</ul>
These injuries mostly involved the neck and head, with things like bone breaks or concussions. Some children suffered burns or other injuries.
<h2>There is good news</h2>
One piece of positive news is that the annual number of injuries from infant walkers has dramatically decreased during the period of research &#x2013; from 20,650 in 1990 to 2,001 in 2014. The authors attribute this drop to the safety measures implemented in the 1990s, as well as advocacy efforts to ban baby walkers.

And, data showed that injuries dropped 23% in the four years after federal safety standards were implemented in 2010.

Dr. Gary Smith, the study&#x2019;s senior author, reminded parents and guardians, &#x201C;However, it is important for families to understand that these products are still causing serious injuries to young children and should not be used.&#x201D; Smith believes their research backs up the AAP&apos;s call for a ban of both the sale and manufacture of infant walkers in the United States.

BODY:
Two recently released studies show that a new treatment for spinal injuries has helped three patients with paralysis defy the odds and walk again. This surgically implanted device sends electrical impulses to the spine, mimicking the signals the brain would send before paralysis.

These studies were published in two separate scientific journals in September &#x2013; the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1803588" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New England Journal of Medicine</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0175-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Medicine</a>.

In the first study from the New England Journal of Medicine, two of four patients with motor complete spinal cord injury (no voluntary movement below the site of their injury) were able take steps and walk after having a spinal cord stimulation device implanted, and undergoing intense and extensive physical therapy. These patients can now walk for a limited amount of time with the aid of walkers.

&quot;This should change our thinking about people with paralysis,&quot; Susan Harkema, professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville, and one of the lead researchers on the project, told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/24/health/paralyzed-woman-walks-again/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a>. &quot;It&apos;s phenomenal. This new knowledge is giving us the tools to develop new strategies and tools for recovery in people with chronic spinal injuries.&quot;

Claudia Angelia is the other lead researcher on the project, and a senior researcher at the Human Locomotion Researcher Center at Frazier Rehab Institute in Louisville. &#x201C;These individuals, after their injuries, are always told there is no possibility for recovery. Now we are showing that the spinal cord has that capacity to restore function,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/theresatamkins/paralyzed-patients-walk-spinal-cord-implant?bfsource=ovthpcontrol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angeli</a> said. &#x201C;We do not have all the answers and we are not claiming to have all the answers, but we are very hopeful.&#x201D;

The implant study focused on four patients, who underwent therapy concentrating on standing and stepping twice a day, five days a week, for months. One patient&apos;s therapy lasted nearly a year. All four were able to stand independently after receiving the implant and going through therapy, and two were able to walk over ground. However, one patient fractured his hip, setting his therapy back by several months.

Researchers believe the positive results were a combination of the implant&apos;s stimulation and an improvement in physical therapy treatments.

Another study published the same day as the New England Journal of Medicine study showed similar results. Research released in Nature Medicine showed that a man paralyzed from a spinal cord injury in 2013 was able to stand and walk (with assistance) with a combination of spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy.

Dr. Kendall Lee, director of the Mayo Clinic&apos;s Neural Engineering Laboratories, explained in a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180924115930.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>, &#xA0;&#x201C;What this is teaching us is that those networks of neurons below a spinal cord injury still can function after paralysis.&#x201D; Kristin Zhao, Ph.D., co-principal investigator and director of Mayo Clinic&apos;s Assistive and Restorative Technology Laboratory, added, &#x201C;Now I think the real challenge starts, and that&apos;s understanding how this happened, why it happened, and which patients will respond.&#x201D;

Spinal cord injuries can be catastrophic, both physically and emotionally. If you suffer partial or full paralysis in accident due to another&apos;s negligence or recklessness, the personal injury attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help.

BODY:
A recent report in the American Journal of Transplantation described a rare and &#x201C;extraordinary&#x201D; case in Europe, where donated organs from a 53-year-old woman spread breast cancer to four different transplant recipients.

According to the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajt.14766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, four recipients developed cancer years after their transplants, and three of the four eventually died. The donor died from bleeding in the brain; physical exams, lab testing, ultrasounds, and x-rays showed at the time that she had no troublesome medical history. Her organs &#x2013; heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys &#x2013; were transplanted into five individuals.

Only a few months after the transplant, the heart recipient died of sepsis, an immune response to infection.

The other recipients survived longer. However, in the six years following all of the transplants, all four of the recipients developed metastatic breast cancer. Metastatic is the kind of cancer that spreads to other organs in the body, which is more difficult to treat. Testing of the DNA cancer cells showed the cancer had come from the donor.

Further testing revealed the donor had breast cancer at the time of her death, but doctors were unaware. Otherwise, her organs would have been unable to be donated, as people with active or invasive cancers are unsuitable for organ donation, according to the authors of the study.

The recipients of the donor&apos;s liver, lung, and left kidney eventually died from their breast cancer. The recipient of the right kidney, a 32-year-old man, survived after having his donated kidney removed and undergoing chemotherapy. In 2012, he achieved complete remission and, as of his last follow up in 2017, he was still cancer-free and seeking a new kidney.
<h2>Cancer from a donated organ is incredibly rare</h2>
Although this isn&apos;t the first documented case of cancer from a donated organ spreading to a transplant recipient, this case is so notable because one donor spread cancer to four people. And, the authors add, it took a considerable amount of time for the cancer to grow and symptomize in the recipients&apos; bodies.

According to the report, the risk of getting cancer from a donated organ is extremely low &#x2013; between 0.01 and 0.05 percent.

It&apos;s not clear, however, why the donor&apos;s breast cancer wasn&apos;t detected before her organs were donated. The authors posited in their report that it&apos;s possible she had micrometastases, which are groups of cancer cells that split off the original tumor and spread to other parts of the body.

Micrometastases are too small to be detected on imaging tests. Additionally, transplant recipients must take drugs to suppress their immune systems, which lowers the risk of organ rejection &#x2013; but can make it easier for cancer cells to survive.

BODY:
A 16-year-old Georgia high school football player died on September 30, two days after collapsing on the sidelines during a game at Pike County High School in Zebulon. Although there were no immediate signs or cause of his collapse, a recently released <a href="https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/local/coroner-georgia-hs-linebacker-died-due-to-cardiac-arrest-from-head-injury/93-602496175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coroner&apos;s report</a> shows that the teen died of cardiac arrest as a result of traumatic brain injury.

Officials stopped play in the third quarter of the football game against Peach County High School due to an injured player, according to Pike County Coroner Terrell Moody&apos;s timeline. Thomas was able to walk off the field with assistance, but complained of numbness in his leg.

His condition deteriorated, and he left by ambulance and was later transported by helicopter to a hospital in Atlanta. The teen underwent multiple surgeries and other live-saving treatments over the next two days before being declared dead.

Moody also mentioned that Thomas was healthy and had no preexisting medical conditions that would have made him more susceptible to injuries on the field, or during any treatments at the hospital. Regarding the teen&apos;s fatal brain injury, the coroner said it was ultimately an &#x2018;anomaly&#x2019; that required &#x2018;the perfect amount of pressure on the perfect spot at the perfect angle.&#x2019;
<h2>Trying to make sense of what happened</h2>
In a <a href="https://www.ghsa.net/ghsa-statement-dylan-thomas-death" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>, the Georgia High School Association (GHSA) said they reviewed the incident and determined that Thomas was wearing a new 2018 Riddell helmet, the highest-rated helmet the company manufactures. They said there was no indication of negligence by anyone associated with the school and that &#x201C;coaches had taken every precaution to prepare for potential injuries and went beyond the required standards when working within the concussion protocol.&#x201D;

In tragic cases like Dylan Thomas, some injuries are the results of freak accidents. However, his death is also unfortunately part of a spate of recent injuries in high school, college, and professional football. This issue has sparked a debate over whether or not current safety regulations are enough. And many parents are questioning whether young children and teens should be allowed to play football at all.

One major concern about repeated head injury or trauma is CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. CTE is a degenerative brain disease found in people who sustain repeated head trauma, like football players or boxers. The condition is incurable, and one study showed 110 out of 111 former NFL players&apos; brains showed signs of CTE. The chances of CTE increase the longer an athlete plays, but there is also a 21% chance that a high school player could also develop the disease.

BODY:
We&apos;ve known for a long time that women have a higher risk of dying from heart attacks than men. In fact, heart disease is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_women_heart.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of death</a> for women in the United States. However, researchers have been unsure about the causes of this gender gap. A recently released study may shed some light on the issue, and interestingly, it may have something to do with the gender of the attending doctor.

The <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/07/31/1800097115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>, published this past summer, suggests that women are more likely to survive a heart attack when treated by a female doctor rather than a male doctor. The researchers &#x2013; Brad N. Greenwood, Seth Carnahan, and Laura Huang &#x2013; examined more than 580,000 records from Florida emergency rooms for every patient admitted for a heart attack between 1991 and 2010.

Their results? Female ER doctors had a better overall performance than their male peers, even after taking into account patient age, race, and health conditions. Specifically, 13.3% of women and 12.6% of men who saw a male doctor died from their heart attack. To compare, 12% of women and 11.8% of men who saw a female doctor died.

It&apos;s true that these look like very small differences, but these numbers get bigger and bigger if you consider the total number of heart attacks annually. Study co-author Seth Carnahan says, &#x201C;If male doctors had the same mortality rates for their patients that female doctors do, there&#x2019;d be about 100 fewer deaths of female patients in the state of Florida per year.&#x201D;

Researchers believe one of the contributing factors to these gender disparities is that men and women typically display heart attack symptoms differently. Women may not display the signs we associate with a heart attack, like chest pain. Instead, they may have a variety of generalized symptoms, like nausea, fatigue, or dizziness. Sometimes these differences can cause doctors to miss the signs of the heart attack.

The good news? Although these symptoms do make cardiac events more difficult to diagnose, the study suggests that male doctors are learning to recognize the signs of heart attacks in women. They also found that male doctors usually performed better if they had treated a lot of female patients in the past, or worked in ERs with many female colleagues.

&#x201C;It could be that there&#x2019;s knowledge spillover happening,&#x201D; Carnahan said. &#x201C;Maybe female doctors are more likely to put in policies and practices that cue their colleagues to these gender differences in heart attack symptom presentation.&#x201D;

Carnahan warned that the research team is not recommending that patients try to match their doctor to their gender. &#x201C;The main takeaway is you have to really be an advocate for yourself in the emergency room,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Regardless of the doctor&#x2019;s gender, you have to be sure your concerns are being taken seriously.&#x201D;

It&apos;s crucial that everyone recognizes the correct signs of a heart attack. The <a href="http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Heart Association</a> has more information about women and heart disease.

BODY:
Researchers at University College London believe they&apos;ve made a huge leap forward in detecting and treating birth injuries with the development of a new technology called NIRS. NIRS, broadband near-infrared spectroscopy, uses light to detect brain damage in infants. The research team is now planning a formal clinical trial of the device.

The NIRS spectroscopic method uses the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum to literally shine a light into a newborn&apos;s brain in order to measure its health. This allows doctors, pediatricians, and other specialists to recognize and diagnose any brain injuries, and work immediately to mitigate and treat the damage.
<h2>Early treatment of brain injuries is crucial</h2>
The health of your baby&apos;s life in its first few hours, days, and weeks are critical. If your baby suffered a brain bleed or <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/injuries/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy/">oxygen deprivation</a> during labor and delivery, the doctor must know the extent of the birth injury in order to provide proper early intervention and appropriate treatment.

If an infant does suffer a brain injury during labor and childbirth, the effects can be significant and permanent. Loss of oxygen and damage to the brain can results in birth injuries like cerebral palsy, impaired vision, weakened body systems, organ failure, or death.
<h2>What is NIRS technology? How does it work?</h2>
The biggest value of the broadband near-infrared spectroscopy system, other than early detection, is that it&apos;s non-invasive and portable. It&apos;s developed for use immediately after birth. NIRS takes advantage of the fact that a baby&apos;s skull and scalp is so thin, detecting oxygen and blood levels in a baby&apos;s brain without having to use any invasive procedures.

The device is placed on the infant&apos;s head, where it shines red and infrared light into their brain. It detects changes in brain oxygen levels and energy usage through differences in the color of the light reflected. Sensors on the device measure the reflected light to determine the health of the infant&apos;s brain cells.

The less invasive the better, says Kathy Beardsall, a neonatologist from Addenbrooke&#x2019;s Hospital in Cambridge. She tells the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45522794">BBC</a>, &#x201C;In these vulnerable babies, being able to use a bedside, non-invasive technology would be a great advance in care. It overcomes the problem of having to wait and transfer babies off the intensive care unit for an MRI when they are more stable.&#x201D;

When brain damage is detected early, doctors are able to intervene early and begin providing appropriate treatment. Dr. Gemma Bale is an engineer from University College London and is developing the device. She also spoke to the BBC about NIRS, explaining, &#x201C;The first week after birth is a really critical time in babies&#x2019; development. If we are able to get in sooner to assess the damage, we can tailor treatment to save lives and help prevent disability further down the line.&#x201D;

Some birth injuries are evident immediately after delivery. Some, however, may not be, and this is why early detection and intervention are so important.

BODY:
Most labor and deliveries go exactly as planned, with mother and baby both healthy and happy. However, there are instances where things go wrong and the child suffers a birth injury. Sometimes these injuries can&apos;t be avoided. Sometimes they occur due to negligence and improper care.

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a condition in some newborns characterized by breathing difficulties. It happens when the baby&apos;s body fails to produce enough of a substance called surfactant, which lubricates the lungs. Because of this, babies with RDS have difficulty expanding their lungs, making it hard for them to take in oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.

When a newborn fails to get enough oxygen to their brain, they can suffer serious birth injuries, like brain damage or cerebral palsy.
<h2>Causes of RDS</h2>
RDS is most prevalent in newborns and relatively uncommon in full-term infants. Almost all babies <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/respiratory-distress-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born before 28 weeks</a> will develop RDS. Premature birth makes the risk so high because surfactant helps the lungs stay open. Without enough surfactant, the lungs collapse and make it extremely difficult for the baby to breathe.

Other causes or risks for RDS include:
<ul>
    <li>Twins/multiples</li>
    <li>Maternal diabetes</li>
    <li>Maternal hemorrhaging</li>
    <li>Rapid labor</li>
    <li>Older sibling who had RDS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preventing respiratory distress syndrome</h2>
The best way to prevent RDS birth injuries is to prevent premature birth, or provide the appropriate care and treatment if premature birth is inevitable.

Prenatal care is the key to preventing premature birth and the risk of RDS. Obstetricians should check for complications that might increase the risk of premature birth and provide proper medical intervention. If it&apos;s not possible to prevent premature birth, doctors can perform tests to check on the development of the baby&apos;s lungs to detect the risk of RDS.
<h2>Complications of RDS</h2>
RDS can cause <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/birth-injuries-and-complications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term complications and birth injuries</a> if not treated or treated improperly:
<ul>
    <li>Collapsed lung</li>
    <li>Pneumothorax</li>
    <li>Hemorrhage</li>
    <li>Asthma</li>
    <li>Sepsis</li>
    <li>Intracranial hemorrhages (brain bleeds)</li>
    <li>Brain damage</li>
    <li>Intellectual disabilities</li>
    <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
    <li>Blindness and vision problems</li>
</ul>
If your child has suffered a birth injury, an attorney can answer all of your questions.

When you&apos;re pregnant, your doctor should provide you proper prenatal care, as well as monitoring during delivery. If they fail to do so, your child is at risk for a birth injury. If this happened to you and your baby, the lawyers at Crandall &amp; Pera can help. Please call 877-686-8879, or fill out our <a href="/Contact.shtml">contact form</a>, and schedule your free consultation with an experienced birth injury lawyer at one of our offices in Ohio or Kentucky.

&#x201C;All courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.&#x201D; &#x2013; The Kentucky Constitution, Section 14 of the Bill of Rights.

The right to a fair trial by a jury of your peers is one of the bedrocks of our country. As attorneys, we have sworn to uphold these laws, and fight for these rights on behalf of our clients, and the civil justice system itself. That included fighting against medical malpractice review panels, ever since the idea first made its way into the Kentucky State Senate in 2009, and then later when the Kentucky General Assembly enacted it as the Medical Review Panel Act in 2016.
<ul>
    <li>We Knew Kentucky&#x2019;s Medical Malpractice Review Panels Were a Terrible Idea</li>

    <li>Kentucky Medical Malpractice Screening Panels</li>
    <li>Kentucky Legislation to Establish Medical Review Panel</li>
</ul>
That is why we are thrilled to announce that on November 15, 2018, the Supreme Court of Kentucky sided on behalf of the state and federal Constitutions. In the <a href="http://opinions.kycourts.net/sc/2017-SC-000614-TG.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opinion written by Chief Justice Minton</a>, the Court states &#x201C;We hold that because the Act delays access to the courts of the Commonwealth for the adjudication of common-law claims. Chapter 216C violates Section 14 of the Kentucky Constitution.&#x201D;
<h2>A waste of Kentuckians&#x2019; time and taxes</h2>
The Medical Review Panel Act forced victims of medical malpractice to submit their claims to a four-person panel, made up of 3 health care professionals (voting) and one lawyer (non-voting) who would then decide whether or not the claim had enough merit to move forward in court. A person could still file a lawsuit, but the panel&#x2019;s findings would have been admissible in court.

As of September of this year, the panel had managed to review 58 of the 531 claims before it. Overall, 89% of all the claims before the panel had not yet been addressed.

These were costly and time-wasting delays, and for many patients, it only made things worse. Imagine if you had been attacked by a dog, and you had to bring your claim to a panel of people who were in the business of training dogs to attack strangers. Or if you had been robbed, and your jury was made up entirely of convicted robbers.

Asking victims of medical malpractice to submit their claims to doctors and health professionals, who may have known the medical facility or doctors named in the claim, is as already suspect. To then delay their claims unnecessarily, causing them to go further into medical debt, or to suffer needlessly for longer &#x2013; that, to us, is both unjust and cruel.

We applaud this ruling handled down by the Supreme Court of Kentucky. The Kentucky lawmakers &#x2013;&#xAD; both in the Assembly and the Governor &#x2013; &#xAD;knew this was likely to be ruled unconstitutional, and they did it anyway. These panels cost every taxpayer in Kentucky money. They have done more harm than good, and striking down the law once and for all is a victory not only for victims of medical malpractice, but for the civil justice system itself.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we will always do what we must to protect our clients their rights. If you were the victim of medical malpractice in Kentucky or Ohio, we can help.

It takes a lot for a Medical Review Board to revoke a doctor&#x2019;s license. That is why, when it does happen, you can be sure that the doctor who lost his or her license must have either done something truly egregious, or have had a number of complaints lodged against him/her.

In order to help protect patients, the states keep a running <a href="https://www.patientsrightsblog.com/how-to-research-your-doctor-for-your-best-chance-at-quality-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of licensed doctors</a>, accessible online. You can find out whether or not your doctor is licensed to practice, whether or not her or she has ever had a complaint or malpractice case filed against him/her, or whether or not his or her license has ever been suspended or revoked. What you <em>cannot</em> always find out is whether or not a doctor has been reprimanded in another state... which is why a &#x201C;doctor&#x201D; like Larry Mitchell Isaacs has managed to keep practicing medicine at an urgent care clinic here in Cincinnati, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/30/medical-board-license-failures-doctor-malpractice-move-states/2159948002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite having had to surrender his license and/or faced sanctions</a> in Louisiana, California and New York.

USA TODAY, in conjunction with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and MedPage Today, reports &#x201C;More than 250 doctors who surrendered a medical license were able to practice in another state,&#x201D; and that &#x201C;In a third of the 250 cases, doctors who surrendered their licenses were able to practice elsewhere without any limitations or public disclosure, simply by changing their addresses.&#x201D;
<h2>License revocation vs. surrendering a license</h2>
In the end, whether a doctor surrenders his/her license, or has it revoked, the end game is the same: that doctor is no longer allowed to practice medicine in that state. The difference between the two, however, is accountability. If a State Board revokes a doctor&#x2019;s license, that Board is sending a clear message that the doctor has done something wrong. This information is made public and searchable. In most cases, if a doctor&#x2019;s license has been revoked in one state, the chances are good that it will be revoked in another.

When a person surrenders a professional license, however, all of that information may not be available &#x2013; and it won&#x2019;t stop another state from allowing a doctor to practice. This is because surrendering a license is a voluntary act; it is up to the doctor to surrender in every state, not the Licensing Board.

And it appears that most doctors simply won&#x2019;t do that.
<h2>This is an ongoing problem</h2>
Bad behavior is not just limited to doctors refusing to surrender their licenses in all states. We have discussed a similar problem with surgical centers, where a doctor who has been banned from one facility can just open up a new one somewhere else. We have also looked into doctors who have been <a href="https://www.patientsrightsblog.com/bad-doctors-make-great-consultants-just-ask-pharmaceutical-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cited or censured for impropriety or inadequate care</a>, yet still get paid millions by the pharmaceutical industry as consultants. Per USA TODAY:

&#x201C;Earlier, the Journal Sentinel and MedPage Today used data from the firm to identify more than 500 doctors who had been disciplined in one state yet still were able to practice elsewhere with a clean license.

The news organizations also found 73 cases where the U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters to doctors alleging serious patient safety concerns, though only one had been disciplined by a state board.

The investigation found 216 doctors who collected a total of $26 million from federal taxpayers through Medicare despite losing a license or being excluded from state-paid health care rolls.&#x201D;
<h2>Getting the information you need to make an informed decision</h2>
Checking out the <a href="https://www.med.ohio.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Medical Board of Ohio</a> or the <a href="https://kbml.ky.gov/physician/Pages/Physician-Profile-Verification-of-Physician-License.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure</a> is a good start, but you may not be able to find all the information you need when it comes to acts of negligence or malpractice. The <a href="https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/topNavigation/aboutUs.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Practitioner Data Bank</a> (NPDB) is a Congressionally-established, &#x201C;web-based repository of reports containing information on medical malpractice payments and certain adverse actions related to health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers.... that prevents practitioners from moving state to state without disclosure or discovery of previous damaging performance.&#x201D; Ideally, the NPDB exists so that licensing boards can find (and potentially punish) repeat offenders.

In other words, if your doctor has surrendered a license in another state, the NPDB will know. As a member of the general public, you only have access to a limited amount of information &#x2013; and as your attorneys, we can only access information under a very specific set of circumstances.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we believe that healthcare consumers deserve better than what they get. Congress has acted once before; it might be time to do so again, to ensure that more people won&#x2019;t get hurt simply because a bad doctor wants to keep practicing medicine. Until that happens, however, we will be here to fight on behalf of malpractice victims throughout Ohio and Kentucky.

Due to modern safety regulations, train derailment is not a frequent occurrence in the 21<sup>st</sup> century &#x2013; but this year seems to be the exception:
<ul>
    <li>On February 11, a freight train derailed in Hughson, <a href="https://www.modbee.com/latest-news/article199557754.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spilling debris all over the highway</a>.</li>
    <li>On August 2, an <a href="https://wtop.com/dc-transit/2018/08/amtrak-train-derails-outside-dcs-union-station/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amtrak train derailed</a> on the outskirts of Union Station in D.C. There were 190+ passengers on board.</li>
    <li>On May 24, a freight train carrying poultry in Aurora, Illinois derailed, <a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/05/24/freight-train-derailment-aurora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tipping over onto the tracks</a>.</li>
    <li>On November 2, a &#x201C;minor derailment of Amtrak rail maintenance equipment&#x201D; in the Hudson River Tunnels in New York led to delays, but <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/transportation/2018/11/02/amtrak-derailment-causes-60-minute-delays-and-out-penn-station/1856203002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thankfully not to any injuries</a>.</li>
</ul>
Although these derailments concluded with no injuries or deaths to passengers or employees (though we cannot vouch for any chickens), that is not always the case. The last few years have seen <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/a-list-of-recent-amtrak-derailments-crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple derailments</a>, leading to multiple deaths and catastrophic injuries.
<h2>Reasons for derailments</h2>
These incidents are usually caused by specific failures, including failure of running gear, track component failure, unusual rail and track interaction, collisions, and signal errors. When train vehicles run off the rails, they do not necessarily leave the track. Any derailment has the potential to cause serious injury and property damage.

Specific causes of train derailments include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Track component failure</strong>. Parts of the track fail, but not the vehicle itself. Reasons can include broken track rails due to lack of maintenance or repair.</li>
    <li><strong>Failure of the running gear</strong>. Parts of the engine fail, including the wheels when they are not lubricated properly.</li>
    <li><strong>Uncommon track interaction</strong>. Occurs when heat or other conditions negatively affect an element of the train or track.</li>
    <li><strong>Miscommunication resulting in signal errors</strong>. Train drivers have access to safety systems such as trap points which can be used to avoid a collision. However, when these systems are not accessed in time, derailments and crashes can occur.</li>
    <li><strong>Train collisions with an object at a crossing</strong>. These collisions are the most common reason for train derailments. Most commonly, the object impacted is a motor vehicle. However, other objects such as animals or other obstacles can lead to derailment and disaster.</li>
</ul>
These accidents are referred to as common carrier accidents. Railroads are required to follow strict safety procedures and guidelines designed to avoid derailments and crashes. If they fail to do so, they can be held liable for any injuries resulting from an incident. Individuals or families harmed in a train derailment can contact an experienced injury attorney to find out more about their options.

The consequences of a train derailment can include both minor and major injuries. If you have suffered any type of injury from a train accident, our experienced Ohio and Kentucky attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law are here to help you secure the financial recovery you deserve for your losses.

BODY:
I heard a joke a few years ago. It went like this:

A couple is at home when their heater breaks. Neither one knows how to fix the heater, so they call the local handyman to come and take a look. He gets to the home, checks out the heater, and diagnoses the problem. The couple agrees to pay the man $1,000 (it&#x2019;s soooo cold!), as long as he fixes the heater immediately. He grabs a hammer, bangs the side of the heater, and voila! It works perfectly, once again.

The couple is outraged. &#x201C;You really expect us to pay $1000 just because you swung a hammer at the heater?&#x201D; they ask. &#x201C;Either one of us could have hit the heater with a hammer!&#x201D;

&#x201C;Ah,&#x201D; the handyman replies. &#x201C;So you could have. But I&#x2019;m the one who knew exactly where to swing.&#x201D;

If you are a hammer swinger, you&#x2019;re probably chuckling &#x2013; and if you&#x2019;re one half of the couple, I&#x2019;d guess this isn&#x2019;t a very funny joke at all.

But it does prove a point. America spends hundreds of billions of dollars on higher education, not including private scholarships. As parents, we encourage our kids to stay in school, to study hard, and to pursue one (or more) college degrees, in the hopes of increasing their chances of living the American Dream. We tell them that a college education is the <em>only</em> way to get ahead and make lives for themselves. And some may even fall back on the old proverb that if you give a man a fish, he will eat for a day &#x2013; but if you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.

But what happens to those kids who don&#x2019;t <em>want</em> to learn to fish? The ones who&#x2019;d rather learn to make the reels and fishing rods, so to speak? What happens to the <a href="https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/how-other-half-learns-reorienting-education-system-fails-most-students-11419.html">80% of students who don&#x2019;t</a> &#x201C;travel smoothly from high school diploma to college degree to career&#x201D;? What are we, as country, doing to help them gain the skills they need to be successful?

As it turns out, not much.
<h2>College costs keep rising, but the return remains the same</h2>
In a recent piece by <em>The New York Times</em>, Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, made the case for funding vocational education by pointing out that the push for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/opinion/college-vocational-education-students.html">college education has not actually prepared people</a> for a working life in America. As he explains, &#x201C;Forty years of reform, accompanied by a doubling of per pupil spending, has failed to improve this picture. Standardized test scores haven&#x2019;t budged. SAT scores have declined. More students enroll in college, but <strong>the share of 25-year-olds with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree did not increase from 1995 to 2015, and it stands barely above the 1975 level</strong>&#x201D; (emphasis mine).

Furthermore, the myth that wages increase exponentially with a degree in your back pocket has been thoroughly debunked: &#x201C;The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that high school grads with above-average earnings (50th to 90th percentile) earn $34,000 to $70,000 annually. College grads with below-average earnings (10th to 50th percentile) earn $28,000 to $58,000.&#x201D;

Is that to say that a career which requires a college degree will never pay more than a career where no degree is needed? Of course not: your accountant certainly makes more than a waitress at a local restaurant. But that really isn&#x2019;t a point. The point is that, despite all of this money being thrown at students to go to college, the number of people who are actually <em>getting</em> college degrees isn&#x2019;t all that different today than it was 40 years ago.

The problem is two-fold: first, forcing students towards getting a degree they don&#x2019;t want (or may not be able to complete) just increases debt with no way of paying it off, creating an unnecessary burden for the student; second, having a degree no longer ensures any kind of financial success. And if you don&#x2019;t believe me, ask any number of young adults (or even not-so-young adults) who find themselves in entry-level positions because they cannot find work in their chosen career.

What Cass argues is simple: for less money, we can fund additional pathways to success for students who have no desire to pursue a degree. He lays out his plan this way:

&#x201C;For the roughly $100,000 that the public spends to carry many students through high school and college today, we could offer instead two years of traditional high school, a third year that splits time between a sophisticated vocational program and a subsidized internship, two more years split between subsidized work and employer-sponsored training, and a savings account with $25,000, perhaps for future training. Any American could have, at age 20, three years of work experience, an industry credential and earnings in the bank.&#x201D;
<h2>Education for education&#x2019;s sake</h2>
So: is Cass correct? Maybe. If you believe that education, at any point, is simply a means to a production-driven end, then spending money to ensure students can learn valuable skills and trades may be the right option. If, however, you believe that all students should be learning for the sake of learning itself, and that education is fundamentally a way to ensure that all people are good stewards of their citizenship, then Cass&#x2019;s suggestion might be horrifying.

But regardless of what side of the debate you&#x2019;re on, this much is clear: $150 billion is too high a price tag for a system that is failing more than half of our students. Those who wish to pursue a college degree should, of course, be encouraged and supported. For those who would rather learn a trade, or forgo college altogether, we owe it to them to find a viable pathway forward.

And as far as our handyman goes? Well, who&#x2019;s to say that he doesn&#x2019;t do complex computations without a calculator, or love opera, or study current events, or complete the Times Sunday Crossword in black ink? Heck, he may even have a college degree or two, yet found more joy in working with his hands. I bet you know at least one person (and it may even be you) who learned for the sake of learning, and built a good life without ever stepping foot into a college classroom.

At the end of the day, we need to take a good, hard look at what we&#x2019;re doing for our kids. If college isn&#x2019;t the right option for them, what other options are there? Maybe, instead of telling everyone they need to go to college, we should be helping kids &#x2013; ours, and everyone else&#x2019;s &#x2013; find a way forward that works best for them, and allows them to build a life that&#x2019;s both secure and satisfying.

After all, college isn&#x2019;t the only place you might learn exactly where to swing a hammer.

Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication that can lead to high blood pressure and organ damage. If left untreated, it can be fatal for the mother or the baby.

Regarding the exact causes of preeclampsia, experts in the medical community believe the disorder <a href="https://www.preeclampsia.org/health-information/cause-of-preeclampsia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begins in the placenta</a> &#x2013; the organ that provides nourishment to the fetus during pregnancy. They tend to describe the condition in two stages.

In the first stage, the originating cause leads to the placenta producing certain proteins or placental debris that enter the mother&#x2019;s circulation and are believed to cause the second stage. In the second stage, the overt maternal disease occurs, which involves liver, kidney, high blood pressure, and coagulation abnormalities. The overt disease depends on:
<ul>
    <li>The health of the mother (i.e., diseases affecting the vasculature such as pre-existing genetic, metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular factors, as well as obesity)</li>
    <li>The action of the circulating factors (i.e., proteins, placental debris)</li>
</ul>
On the genetic side, individuals with a family history of preeclampsia as well as African-American women are statistically more likely to encounter the condition.

Mothers pregnant with twins, those with first-time pregnancies, and those with a history of renal disease, lupus, or vascular disorders tend to experience preeclampsia more often. Other conditions predisposing someone to preeclampsia include primary hypertension, obesity, and type I or type II diabetes.

</ul>
<h2>Can I prevent preeclampsia?</h2>
There are certain steps you and your medical provider can take to prevent and treat preeclampsia. One of the most important steps is accessing proper prenatal care. This is highly important for early diagnosis and effective management of the condition should it occur. In other words, it&#x2019;s important not to skip any doctor visits. These appointments allow your medical provider the opportunity to perform a number of important checks, including blood pressure and urine. Your doctor should be able to diagnose any early signs of preeclampsia from these test results as well as feedback you provide about your health otherwise.

Since obesity is a definitive risk factor for developing preeclampsia, doctors should also encourage women who are overweight or obese prior to pregnancy toward achieving weight loss. Proper weight management can also deter the onset of diabetes, which itself is another risk factor for the development of preeclampsia. Your provider can help you formulate a weight loss plan if you are planning to get pregnant and are concerned about your current weight.
<h2>After diagnosis, how is preeclampsia treated?</h2>
When the baby is delivered, preeclampsia is treated by the removal of the placenta. However, if you are still early in your pregnancy, rather than placenta removal, the condition is better managed than treated.

Close follow-up and observation are key aspects of managing a preeclampsia condition. This involves frequent monitoring of the growth of the baby through ultrasound, as well as checking your blood pressure and urine. Sometimes blood pressure medications can be used that reduce the mother&#x2019;s risk of stroke, but to not particularly manage the condition. Eclampsia, a seizure that can result from a severe case of preeclampsia, may be prevented with the medication magnesium sulfate.
<h2>After I deliver, am I free from further health risks?</h2>
Some potential long-term effects of developing preeclampsia during pregnancy do exist. About <a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis?search=preeclampsia&amp;source=search_result&amp;selectedTitle=2~150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 6 pregnancies</a> suffer a recurrence of preeclampsia. The condition also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease, but this risk correlates with the severity of the condition.

In some cases, preeclampsia may be diagnosed after delivery of the baby. This is referred to as postpartum preeclampsia. There is uncertainty in the medical community as to why this occurs. The timeframe for this condition can land between two days postpartum and fewer than six weeks postpartum. The symptoms and risk factors are identical to those for preeclampsia occurring prior to birth.

If you or your baby is suffering or has suffered from the effects of preeclampsia due to inadequate care or misdiagnosis, the Ohio and Kentucky medical malpractice attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can help. We can fight to help you obtain the financial compensation you deserve at this time.

BODY:
Bankruptcy has the potential to swallow up a large part of the award you receive from a personal injury claim. How much you get to keep depends on the exemptions that apply. Every state has their own set of exemptions, and the federal government provides exemptions, too. Sometimes, you have to use the state exemptions (as in Ohio); other times, you can choose which set you use (as Kentucky allows).
<h2>Exemptions for personal injury claims in Ohio</h2>
<strong>Bodily Injury</strong>

Under Ohio Rev. Code &#xA7; 2329.66(A)(12)(c), the exemption is $23,000 for personal injury claims. This amount only covers bodily injury to yourself or your dependent. Any part of the award provided for pain and suffering is not part of the exemption.

<strong>Lost Wages</strong>

You may have the opportunity to exempt 75 percent of any award provided to you for lost wages. However, it is important to consult an experienced attorney familiar with bankruptcy law in Ohio to determine the best way to protect your award.

<strong>Future Wages</strong>

Under Ohio Rev. Code &#xA7; 2329.66(A)(13)(b) you can exempt the portion of your award covering lost future wages if you demonstrate you actually need the financial support it provides and you receive it within the year before you file.

<strong>Wrongful Death Suits</strong>

Under Ohio Rev. Code &#xA7; 2329.66(A)(12)(b), you may exempt a portion or all of the compensation you received in a wrongful death suit for a deceased individual upon whom you were dependent, under two conditions:
<ol>
    <li>You received compensation within one year prior to filing your bankruptcy, and</li>
    <li>You can demonstrate that you require the money to financially support yourself and your dependents.</li>
</ol>
<strong>General Exemptions</strong>

Under Ohio Rev. Code &#xA7; 2329.66(A)(3), you may exempt $450 in cash or in a bank account that can help you protect a portion of your personal injury compensation if you have previously received the settlement payment.

In addition, under Ohio Rev. Code &#xA7; 2329.66(A)(18), the state provides you with a wildcard exemption up to $1,225. You may use this money to protect part of a personal injury claim or any asset.

It is important to remember that combining settlement funds with money derived from other sources can cancel out your exemptions. Therefore, keep your personal injury compensation funds in a separate account.
<h2>Exemptions for personal injury claims in Kentucky</h2>
The state of Kentucky provides specific exemptions involving personal injury awards, too. Kentucky Rev. Stat. Ann &#xA7; 427.150 protects:
<ul>
    <li>Maximum of $7,500 from a personal injury award stemming from an injury to yourself or your dependent. The exemption is allowed in the amount necessary to support yourself and your dependents.</li>
    <li>Awards for future earning losses to the degree reasonably required to support you and your dependents</li>
</ul>
Kentucky Rev. Stat. Ann &#xA7; 427.150 allows for a wildcard exemption up to $1,000.

However, the federal exemptions, which are available in Kentucky, are more generous:

The bankruptcy code personal injury exemption according to 11 U.S.C. 522(d)(11)(D) allows you to keep up to $23,675 from a personal injury award or settlement. This does not include compensation for monetary losses or pain and suffering. If a couple files together as plaintiffs, this amount may double to $47,350.

If you have suffered an injury due to the negligence of another party in Ohio or Kentucky, we are here to fight on your behalf for the compensation you need at this time.

Hunting season is in full swing and hunters have the right to expect the equipment and tools they depend on in the field will function safely. This includes not only firearms, but also bows, tree stands, traps, and blinds. If you use any of these devices that prove faulty, the potential to sustain an injury exists, and you may also have a legitimate defective product claim for compensation.

Although hunting accidents can result from one person making an error and causing personal injury to another, some accidents occur because of defective equipment that malfunctions at an inopportune time for the victim.
<h2>Types of hunting equipment defects</h2>
Of the many types of hunting equipment available to the hunter, defective tree stands cause a significant number of the injuries hunters experience. When a tree stand fails, the hunter is at risk for sustaining serious injuries such as brain injury, broken bones, and spinal cord injury.

Defective firearms cause injuries and death each year. Firearm manufacturer, Remington, recently settled a large class-action lawsuit involving a product liability claim. According to a 2017 CNBC report, the lawsuit alleged the company &#x201C;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/09/remington-rifle-triggers-lawsuit-settlement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concealed a deadly design defect</a> that allowed the guns to fire without the trigger being pulled.&#x201D; According to the settlement, the company was required to replace the triggers at no expense to the owners plus other product expenses.

Rifles and other firearms are much of the attention when accidents occur, but defective arrows and bows can be just as dangerous and deadly.
<h2>Proving a hunting equipment liability claim</h2>
If defective hunting equipment causes injury or death, the victims of these accidents and their families have the right to file a product liability claim against multiple liable parties. Proving one of these claims requires the plaintiff demonstrate the following:
<ul>
    <li>The product was defective when the injury occurred</li>
    <li>The product defect was the cause of the injury</li>
    <li>The product defect was the result of poor design, poor workmanship, faulty or inadequate instructions, or other defects for which the equipment makers and/or suppliers are responsible</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common hunting injuries</h2>
Various types of injuries can occur during the course of hunting activities. These injuries vary depending on whether a weapon or other equipment caused the injury. They include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Traumatic brain injuries</strong><strong>.</strong>Hunters with lack of experience can suffer head injuries from a rifle kickback when the gun is misplaced. Individuals are accidentally shot every year in this way, either by themselves or by others. Hunters face more common risk for brain injuries from falls due to defective tree stands.</li>
    <li><strong>Catastrophic injuries</strong><strong>.</strong>Rifles and guns that misfire, barrels that explode, and defective bolt actions can produce permanent injuries. A bow hunter can also incur serious injury from misfires or if the bow equipment shatters and the hunter is impacted by shrapnel. Catastrophic injuries suffered by owners can include permanent burns or scarring and loss of a body part.</li>
    <li><strong>Wrongful death</strong><strong>.</strong>In the worst case scenarios, a bullet, arrow, or other weapon can take the life of a hunter or other bystander. Families of those killed in these accidents have the legal right to seek compensation through a wrongful death claim if a defective product was involved.</li>
</ul>
The injury attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law understand the devastation that can be caused by hunting accidents. If you or a loved one has suffered an injury in a hunting accident due to defective hunting equipment in Ohio or Kentucky, we can help you secure the compensation you deserve for your losses.

According to a BMJ study published in 2016, <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical errors are the third most common cause of fatalities in the U.S.</a> behind cardiovascular disease and cancer. Making the issue even worse, most of these errors are unreported.

Over the course of an average hospital stay, the typical surgery patient is transferred between various departments, eventually <a href="https://medicalreview.columbia.edu/article/communication-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observed by as many as 27 separate medical professionals</a>. In the ideal scenario, a patient&#x2019;s medical history, records, and treatment plan are shared between doctors, surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists and other relevant medical professionals.

The stark reality, however, is that patterns of inefficient communication within the healthcare setting often produce a fragmented experience. Medical professionals often work separately to achieve divergent objectives as they make use of unrelated pieces of data or operate without important data in some cases.

This form of miscommunication is likely one of the largest factors contributing to dangerous and costly medical errors. The number of <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical errors that lead to death are estimated at over 250,000 each year</a>, with that number as a conservative estimate.
<h2>The U.S. healthcare system makes communication failure too easy</h2>
The disjointed health care system in the U.S. contributes to a lack of efficient coordination between patients, providers, and insurers.

As well, within a single hospital in which an entire team of physicians and nurses are supposed to work together, ineffective communication and poor work relationships between professionals can deter effective care.

The emphasis toward larger and more specialized medical teams has increased the required levels of communication in order to properly care for a patient. The more communication required, the greater the chance for inadequate communication or miscommunication.

Technological advances in electronic record-keeping are designed to improve coordination. But, a single error or failure to record vital data can result in medical treatment errors that are not detected until the patient suffers more as a result.
<h2>Add the intense work environment</h2>
When a stressful work environment is combined with the life-and-death decision making that occurs in hospitals, the possibility of significant communication failures exist. Additional factors related to this including constant rotations, long shifts, administrative difficulties, and time constraints, all of which can produce interpersonal frustrations. The errors that occur in administering treatment to patients are not surprising in the face of frustration, physician burnout, increased workload, and mistrust that develops between coworkers in certain cases.

A study published in <em>The Online Journal of Issues in Nursing</em> in 2015 revealed that <a href="http://ojin.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ANAMarketplace/ANAPeriodicals/OJIN/TableofContents/Vol-20-2015/No3-Sept-2015/Articles-Previous-Topics/Relationships-between-Nurses-and-Physicians-Matter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half of nurses</a> said their patient care decisions were influenced by the behavior of the physicians they work under. This behavior can include how well they communicated about patient care plans and whether they treated nurses with respect.

Poor communication between medical personnel is a potentially far worse problem than simply impacting morale in the workplace. It is a large factor contributing to medical malpractice claims against hospitals and hospital staff.
<h2>Miscommunication and poor communication</h2>
Lapses in communication between doctors and patients as well as poor communication between healthcare providers often lead to medical mistakes. According to MedPro, miscommunication is the <a href="https://www.medpro.com/documents/10502/2820774/Communication+as+a+Contributing+Risk+Factor+in+Diagnostic+Errors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second most common factor contributing to medical malpractice lawsuits</a>.

A critical juncture in the patient treatment process where avoidable communication errors occur is during patient handoff. This takes place when a patient&#x2019;s care plan and history is transferred from one caregiver to the next. When this transition is performed ineffectively, serious mistakes can occur, including lost medical records, delayed treatment, administering wrong medication, and potentially permanent injury or death.

When the entire scope of patient care is examined from afar, the problems that lead to poor communication become evident. For example, a single surgery patient must often deal with numerous specialists, including a referring doctor, surgeon, lab technician, anesthesiologist, and other specialists. In the majority of cases, each professional operates in a separate environment while infrequently or never communicating with each other directly.

Medical malpractice comes in many forms and poor communication between medical providers can lead to serious patient injuries.

BODY:
Over the last 18 months, <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/543928389/lost-mothers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProPublica and NPR</a>, and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/deadly-deliveries/2018/07/26/maternal-mortality-rates-preeclampsia-postpartum-hemorrhage-safety/546889002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA TODAY</a>, launched in-depth investigations into the causes behind America&#x2019;s high maternal mortality rates. What they uncovered shocked the country: that the U.S. is the only developed nation whose maternal death rates are on the rise, and that the primary causes of these deaths were complications arising from preeclampsia and post-partum hemorrhage. (You can <a href="https://www.patientsrightsblog.com/wont-hospitals-prevent-mothers-dying-childbirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read our summary and analysis here</a>.)

These numbers are unacceptable. We understand that, sometimes, mothers die during childbirth for inexplicable or tragic reasons. We know, though, that the deaths uncovered by these investigations were largely preventable. That is why we are thrilled to see that Congress is finally moving on <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1318/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act</a>. ProPublica reports that the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/landmark-maternal-health-legislation-clears-major-hurdle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House approved the bill unanimously</a> &#x201C;to help states improve how they track and investigate deaths of expectant and new mothers. The bipartisan bill authorizes $12 million a year in new funds for five years &#x2014; an unprecedented level of federal support &#x2014; for states to create review committees tasked with identifying maternal deaths, analyzing the factors that contributed to those deaths and translating the lessons into policy changes.&#x201D;
<h2>We need data to fix the problem</h2>
Throughout the country, states have put review panels into place to study the maternal injury and mortality rates, but they vary from state to state &#x2013; and not every state can afford to fund them appropriately or adequately. HR 1318 ensures that each state gets that funding.

And make no mistake: we need it. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-many-american-women-die-from-causes-related-to-pregnancy-or-childbirth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earlier research by ProPublica</a> found that &#x201C;Data collection on maternal deaths is so flawed and under-funded that the federal government no longer even publishes an official death rate.&#x201D;
<h2>Maternal death rates are finally getting recognition</h2>
HR 1318 isn&#x2019;t the only piece of legislation designed to help pregnant women. The Senate (whose companion bill <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S.1112</a> has finally made it on the calendar) just passed the <a href="https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/improving-access-to-maternity-care-act-passes-senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Improving Access to Maternity Care Act</a> with bipartisan support. The Act aims to &#x201C;help reduce maternity care shortages by identifying areas lacking maternal health professionals to help incentivize providers to practice in these underserved, often rural areas,&#x201D; and is awaiting a signature from the President in order to be signed into law. States are also strengthening (or creating) review panels on their own.

In Ohio, maternal mortality review panels were <a href="https://patch.com/ohio/cleveland/here-s-how-dangerous-it-give-birth-ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established in 2010</a>, but the state has lagged when it comes to actually protecting pregnant women and new mothers. As a result, independent groups and organizations have taken up the mantle themselves to see what can be done. Tara Britton is the director of public policy and advocacy at The Center for Community Solutions. She told Cleveland Scene that the focus for years has been on <a href="https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2018/05/15/ohio-researchers-examine-scope-of-maternal-mortality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lowering the infant mortality rate in Ohio</a>, so less work was being done in regard to mothers. Local hospitals are also taking steps to <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20180401/central-ohio-hospitals-ramp-up-efforts-to-reduce-maternal-deaths-amid-growing-national-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce maternal mortality rates</a>.

Kentucky, where <a href="https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/health-of-women-and-children/measure/maternal_mortality/state/KY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maternal mortality rates are a little lower</a> than those in Ohio, also has a review panel &#x2013; but it might not be as effective or as trustworthy, because &#x201C;it is run by the private medical association, not the government health department.... [meaning] the profession is in effect policing itself and might not want to recommend changes that could affect doctors,&#x201D; as Kevin Kavanagh, the doctor who runs Health Watch USA, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/deadly-deliveries/2018/09/19/maternal-death-rate-state-medical-deadly-deliveries/547050002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told USA TODAY</a>. The paper reported the story of one woman whose death was never discovered by the panel, which leads us to wonder if the number of deaths Kentucky reports is actually accurate.

We have much, much more work to do &#x2013; but the bipartisan support and unanimous passing of HR 1318 is an excellent start. We urge you to call your Senators and ask them to pass the companion bill, S.1112, as soon as possible.

BODY:
Truck rollaway accidents usually occur when the driver exits the truck but fails to pull the parking brake first. When this occurs and the truck is on an incline, the vehicle may begin to roll downhill and gain momentum. A rollaway (or runaway) truck, once it picks up enough speed, will mow down whatever gets in its way until it encounters a sufficiently strong obstacle to stop its momentum.

A leading provider of safety technologies &#x2013; Bendix &#x2013; solicited the consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan to perform a survey, which discovered that 6 in 10 fleets admitted to having at least <a href="https://www.trucknews.com/health-safety/bendixs-electronic-parking-brakes-look-to-eliminate-rollaways/1003087471/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one rollaway incident occur in their ranks during the previous two years</a>.

Rollaway crashes can cause vehicle damage, property damage, serious injury, and even death. Bendix has developed an array of new technologies that help deter the problem of rollaways as well as other types of trucking accidents.
<h2>Intellipark System for Rollaway Crash Prevention</h2>
At a recent North American Commercial Vehicle Show, Bendix presented an array of new safety updates and products designed for commercial trucks. The company&#x2019;s Intellipark system is designed to prevent rollaway incidents. The system compensates for the failure of the truck driver to engage the air brakes before leaving the cab. Many trucking companies and their fleets in Ohio and Kentucky can benefit from the installation of this system.

The system automatically applies the brakes when the driver exits the cab. The interlocks can be positioned in strategic locations such as the door, seatbelt, or seat. The system includes switches that are more ergonomically designed than standard push-and-pull devices, making it convenient for drivers to manually apply the brakes.

During an online press conference on Sept, 5, 2018, Bendix indicated that fleet trials of the Intellipark system are finishing up and the <a href="https://www.fleetowner.com/technology/bendix-improves-emergency-braking-collision-mitigation-latest-wingman-fusion-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic electronic parking brake system will be available commercially during 2019</a>.
<h2>Software update for the Wingman Fusion system</h2>
Bendix has produced and made available a software update for its Wingman Fusion system, which is a collision prevention system utilizing video data, radar, and brake system input to deliver lane departure warnings, emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control.
<h2>EnduraSure corrosion resistant spring brakes</h2>
Bendix has also introduced a corrosion resistant and durable line of spring brakes with its <a href="https://www.overdriveonline.com/bendix-system-aims-to-prevent-truck-rollaways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EnduraSure and EnduraSure Pro models</a>.
<h2>Air disc brakes</h2>
Bendix is also investing in air disc brake technology. The company has created an online tool enabling users to price comparison shop. Air disc brakes, which are often less expensive than drum brakes, are highly effective at minimizing stopping distances.

Although these technological advances are entering the marketplace, issues such as defective parts, improper maintenance, and driver error can still result in commercial truck crashes. Motorists who are injured by negligent or reckless truck drivers have the right to consult with an attorney about filing a personal injury claim. An experienced attorney can hire investigators, and evaluate the accident scene, background of the driver, and whether the driver and truck carrier adhered to state and federal trucking regulations.

If you or a loved one has been injured in a truck crash, our Ohio and Kentucky truck accident attorneys at Crandall &amp; Pera Law can provide you with strong representation. We are experienced at handling various types of truck accidents and can fight on your behalf for the compensation you deserve for your injuries.

An intensive care doctor at Mount Carmel Health System may have purposely overdosed multiple patients with a deadly amount of fentanyl. If your loved one died or sustained an injury while being treated by William Huesel, you may have grounds for a wrongful death lawsuit. Contact Crandall &amp; Pera Law today to find out how we can help.
<h2>Patients are dying at Mount Carmel</h2>
People wrongly attribute the phrase &#x201C;First, do no harm&#x201D; to the Hippocratic Oath. But you know what it does say?

&#x201C;I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrong-doing. <strong>Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so</strong>, nor will I suggest such a course&#x201D; (emphasis ours).

So the oath is pretty clear: <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don&#x2019;t murder your patients</a>. Yet one doctor in Mount Carmel may have attempted to do just that.

Per a report by the Associated Press, <a href="https://www.apnews.com/52a181dc578e44b6aa860616eaf6d9c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an intensive care physician</a> at Mount Carmel Health System &#x201C;ordered &#x2018;significantly excessive and potentially fatal&#x201D; doses of pain medicine for at least 27 near-death patients in the past few years after families asked that lifesaving measures be stopped.&#x201D; At this time, 20 employees (including pharmacists and nurses) have been &#x201C;removed&#x201D; from patient care, as part of an ongoing investigation.

A lawsuit has already been filed against one nurse, one pharmacist, and one doctor named William Huesel. Though no criminal charges have yet been filed against Huesel, he was fired as a part of the investigation.
<h2>The victims of a rogue doctor</h2>
The AP claims that &#x201C;The attorney who brought the lawsuit said, in that case, either layers of safeguards repeatedly failed to flag a &#x2018;grossly excessive&#x2019; dosage of fentanyl, or the medical professionals intended to accelerate the death of the patient, 79-year-old Janet Kavanaugh.&#x201D; Ms. Kavanaugh&#x2019;s family has filed a lawsuit against the hospital, a pharmacist, a nurse, and William Huesel.

But this is not the only victim; 27 other people have been identified as potential victims of Huesel, and not all of them were facing the end of their lives. On January 17, 2019, WKBN reported that <a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/ohio/attorney-patient-who-died-from-overdose-may-not-have-been-near-death/1708892799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Allison was also overdosed</a> while being treated at Mount Carmel, which claimed that Mr. Allison&#x2019;s organs were failing. However, per his wife Christine, her husband&#x2019;s condition was <em>not</em> terminal. Her attorney stated &#x201C;We&#x2019;re not seeing anything to suggest that this patient&#x2019;s prognosis was terminal.&#x201D;

On January 22, 2019, <a href="http://www.wcbe.org/post/another-mt-carmel-west-patient-who-died-has-been-identified" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCBE reported</a> that another victim, 37-year-old James Timmons, had been identified. Per that report, &#x201C;The autopsy showed Timmons had a mix of cocaine and fentanyl in his system&#x201D; when he died in October. <em>It is hard to believe that a doctor wouldn&#x2019;t know that a mix of cocaine and fentanyl, one of the strongest and deadliest drugs in the world, would be fatal</em>.
<h2>Making a claim for compensation if your loved one was killed or injured</h2>
While other states may have assisted suicide laws on their books, it is still technically illegal in Ohio. Because of this, you may be entitled to compensation if your loved one was negligently or purposely overdosed with fentanyl while under the care of William Huesel, or while being treated at Mount Carmel Health System. Crandall &amp; Pera Law routinely represents clients in high-profile and complex lawsuits, including wrongful death and medical malpractice claims, in Columbus and throughout Ohio. You could be entitled to damages such as:
<ul>
    <li>Funeral and burial costs</li>
    <li>Medical bills</li>
    <li>Loss of wages</li>
    <li>Pain and suffering</li>
    <li>Punitive damages for gross negligence</li>

A traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects everyone differently, but all brain injuries do have something in common. TBIs are unique from other injuries in that they not only affect the victim physically, but also mentally and emotionally. Brain injuries literally affect every aspect of a person&#x2019;s life, which is what makes them such complex injuries.

When an individual suffers a brain injury, in addition to symptoms like headache or vertigo, he or she can also experience effects to his or her emotions, thoughts, and personality. It&#x2019;s not uncommon for people with TBIs to exhibit increased depression, agitation, or aggression &#x2013; even with those who never showed those types of emotions before.

The frontal lobes of the brain control something scientists call &#x201C;executive functioning,&#x201D; which allows us to do things like prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and control impulsive behavior. In other words, people with injuries to this part of the brain are less likely to take the time to consider the consequences of their actions.
<h2>How might your personality change after a TBI?</h2>
Everyone reacts differently after a brain injury, and some symptoms may clear up over time while some may last for years. However, there are some personality and emotional changes you and your loved ones should look out for:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mood swings.</strong> Emotional ups and downs are one of the most difficult issues to deal with after a traumatic brain injury &#x2013; for both patients and their loved ones. People might go from happy to sad to angry in what feels like the blink of an eye for what feels like no reason at all. This is because there are specific lobes in the brain that control emotions, and if those lobes suffer damage, emotions can become more difficult to manage.</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of trust.</strong> After a TBI, victims may have trouble with trust, even with their families and friends. They might seem paranoid, accusing people of things completely unfounded, or acting suspiciously. Depending on the severity of the injury, some individuals may even suffer hallucinations or delusions.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory loss.</strong> Memory loss due to brain injury can affect someone&#x2019;s personality much the way dementia does to older people. Individuals may not know who their friends and family are, or may not be able to process new memories. Because memories and experiences play a large role in developing our personalities, memory loss can significantly affect personality.</li>
    <li><strong>Impaired judgment. </strong>The frontal lobe of the brain manages judgment and inhibitions &#x2013; it prevents us from making rash decisions and controls impulsive behavior. However, when the frontal lobe is damaged, people may lose their inhibitions and engage in reckless or dangerous behavior, like spending exorbitant amounts of money, cheating on their spouses, or even engaging in violence.</li>
</ul>
Brain injuries and personality changes following an accident can be confusing and heartbreaking. If you or a loved one suffered a traumatic brain injury due to someone else&#x2019;s negligence, the brain injury attorneys of Crandall &amp; Pera Law want to help. We understand the delicate nature of TBIs and can answer all of your questions. Please call&#xA0;877-686-8879&#xA0;or fill out our&#xA0;<a href="/Contact.shtml">contact form</a>&#xA0;to schedule an appointment at one of our offices in Ohio or Kentucky.

Many people, after a car accident, think they don&#x2019;t need to file a police report. Maybe the accident was just a &#x201C;minor&#x201D; one, or maybe the negligent party took responsibility for the incident. However, if it ends up that you need to seek compensation for unanticipated medical bills, that police report will likely be the most valuable piece of evidence you&#x2019;ll have in your possession.

The purpose of a police report is to provide documentation of a car accident. It&#x2019;s an unbiased and third party report about what happened &#x2013; including details like contact information of drivers and witnesses, pertinent information about the accident, initial injuries, and citations issued. And, you&#x2019;ll need a police report to access your own insurance benefits.
<h2>Reading your police report after a crash</h2>
When you receive a copy of your report, the first thing you should do is check it for accuracy. Details matter, especially when you&#x2019;re bringing a case against a negligent driver. You should find the following information on a police report:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vehicle number.</strong> This section is important &#x2013; note which vehicle number you are on the report (V1, V2, etc.). It will appear in several places, so make sure you know which one refers to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Driver information and location.</strong> Check your home address, date of birth, and driver&#x2019;s license number for accuracy, as well as the location of the accident.</li>
    <li>In this section, officers list any traffic violations they believe may have caused the accident, like alcohol or drugs, or careless driving.</li>
    <li><strong>Driver factors.</strong> Driver factors include driver condition and driver actions. These factors can be crucial pieces of evidence in your car accident case, and insurance companies tend to examine them closely when determining compensation.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Driver condition</strong> &#x2013; The police officer will check off anything he or she believes may have factored into your accident (on the part of either driver), including things like &#x201C;appeared normal,&#x201D; &#x201C;apparently asleep,&#x201D; or &#x201C;illegal drug use.&#x201D;</li>
    <li><strong>Driver actions</strong> &#x2013; Actions that might cause a car wreck include &#x201C;failure to yield right of way,&#x201D; &#x201C;failure to obey traffic controls,&#x201D; or &#x201C;inattentive.&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><strong>Driver alcohol/drugs.</strong> This section indicates whether or not either driver was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash. Ensure you read this section carefully as well, as it can be another critical piece of evidence in your case.</li>
</ul>
Remember, the at-fault driver may give a completely different account of the facts to their insurance company, so the police report is your most important tool in getting the maximum amount of compensation to which you&#x2019;re entitled. You can get your report from the city police department or the county sheriff&#x2019;s department that handled your accident.

BODY:
Various types of workplace settings require large vehicles and trailers to perform careful back-up maneuvers. It is in these settings that the potential for truck back-up accidents is elevated.

Although most drivers operate their motor vehicles in reverse gear for only a very small fraction of their driving time, <a href="https://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/videoresource/fsvehiclebackin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 4 vehicle accidents occur while backing up</a>, according to the National Safety Council (NSC).

These crashes often take place at very low speeds, but they have the potential to cause serious injuries and even death. According to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA), <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 200 people are killed every year in back-up accidents</a>.
<h2>Tools to enhance back-up safety</h2>
Every vehicle on the road is equipped with at least a minimum amount of accessories and tools to help drivers reverse safely. These can include rearview mirrors, side mirrors, proximity detection devices, backing cameras, and backing alarms.

Drivers have the responsibility to pay attention to these safety devices while performing back-up maneuvers in addition to ensuring the devices are operating properly prior to commencing a new trip. It is also important for drivers to understand that even the most technologically advanced safety devices may not completely eliminate the problem of blind spots.

Rearview mirrors installed on trucks are sufficient for detecting vehicles behind the truck. However, they are often inadequate for detecting persons, small children, or objects close to the ground.
<h2>Large vehicles and tractor trailers</h2>
Semi-trucks, construction equipment, vehicles equipped with trailers, and other large vehicles pose a potentially more severe backing hazard than smaller vehicles. These vehicles are taller than standard SUVs or other passenger vehicles. As well, they are not always equipped with rear windows or accessible rearview mirrors. When a trailer reverses, it pivots in the opposite direction of the truck&#x2019;s cab. Drivers of trailers must use a spotter when backing up to compensate for the limited view and potential blind spots that exist when attempting to perform a back-up maneuver.

Drivers should take the following safety steps and precautions when backing up a large truck to prevent back-up accidents:
<ul>

In the United States, <a href="http://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/preterm-labor-and-premature-baby.aspx">premature birth</a> is the leading cause of <a href="http://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/long-term-health-effects-of-premature-birth.aspx">permanent disabilities,</a> and sometimes death in babies. In many cases, it is unclear why a woman experiences preterm (premature) birth. A baby that is born before the 37<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy is considered preterm.

Physicians and scientists continue to study the various <a href="http://www.marchofdimes.org/research/finding-the-causes-of-prematurity.aspx">causes of preterm labor</a>, which may allow them to identify risk factors that would cause a woman to be at an increased risk of delivering her baby prematurely. This area of research is very important, because once preterm labor starts, it may be very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to stop it.

One method that is used to help predict which women will experience premature labor is by measuring the length of her cervix (the opening to the uterus). One of the first changes that occur in a woman&#x2019;s body before she goes into labor is shortening (effacement) of her cervix. The cervix may begin to shorten weeks before labor starts. &#xA0;If the cervix is shorter than normal early in her pregnancy, she has a higher risk of premature labor. Based on this risk, her physician can offer treatments to reduce her risk of, or prevent, premature labor.

The most accurate method to check the length of the cervix is by <a href="http://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/cervical-insufficiency-and-short-cervix.aspx">transvaginal ultrasound</a>. Because the cervix begins to thin, or shorten, from the inside, the ultrasound can detect this before a woman&#x2019;s physician or midwife could when performing a vaginal exam.

If you have already delivered a baby that was not born prematurely, or if you are expecting your first baby, it is recommended that measuring the length of your cervix is done as a part of a routine ultrasound between the 18<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy. If the length of the cervix is within the normal range, there is no need to repeat an ultrasound for the purpose of measuring the cervix.

Women who have a history of delivering a baby before the 37<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy due to premature labor have an increased risk of premature labor in future pregnancies. Due to this increased risk, if you experienced preterm labor and delivered a baby before your 37<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy, The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommends that you have the first transvaginal ultrasound to measure cervical length between the 14<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> week of your pregnancy, followed by additional ultrasounds.

One drug that has proven to reduce the risk of preterm birth is called 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, which is a form of <a href="http://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/progesterone-treatment-to-help-prevent-premature-birth.aspx">progesterone</a>. It&#x2019;s also known as &#x201C;17P.&#x201D; In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this drug for the prevention of preterm delivery. It is available in three forms, a pill, injection (shot), or vaginal suppository. Women who take progesterone usually begin in the 16<sup>th</sup> week and stop when they reach the 36<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy. How often it is given depends on what form of the medication is prescribed.

If you have a history of a preterm delivery, talk to your physician or midwife. He, or she, will be able to answer questions based on your personal history.

BODY:
When you are pregnant, it&#x2019;s only natural to think ahead to the day that you finally go into labor. One aspect of labor that is bound to cross your mind is pain; more importantly, ways to reduce the pain. There is little doubt that you will hear of various methods to deal with labor pain. Depending upon where you plan to deliver your baby, you may have different options available to you.

One option that you may hear about is a water birth, where a woman gives birth to her baby while submerged in a tub of warm water. Water births have taken place for decades. In the early 1980s, a French obstetrician published a research paper on his experiences with water births, focusing on the benefits of pain relief.
<h2>Not everyone agrees on the benefits</h2>
While there are many hospitals and birthing centers around the world that give women the option of laboring in warm water, there are different views regarding a woman giving birth while submerged in water due to the risks associated with this practice. Due to concerns regarding safety for a mother and her baby, the opinion of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) on water births is that they are experimental and should only be permitted during experimental trials.<sup>1</sup> The American College of Nurse Midwives and the American Association of Birth Centers, however, consider water births to be a safe practice.<sup>2</sup>

Many hospitals and birthing centers have tubs that women can relax in during the <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/labor/induction-of-labor/">first stage of labor</a>, but they do not permit a mother to remain in the water during her second stage of labor when she is pushing. The main issue regarding water births is the fact that there have not been enough studies performed that weigh the risks and benefits of this practice. There is a risk of a baby drowning. There is also the risk of infection due to the presence of bacteria in the water, as well as the possibility of a delay in providing treatment to a mother, or baby, in case of an emergency.

Whatever option you choose, make sure to discuss it with your doctor or midwife first. He or she will be able to help you make the right decision for you and your baby.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-420" src="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Delayed-Cord-Clamping-300x201.jpg" alt="Delayed Cord Clamping" width="300" height="201">For many years, it was common practice for obstetricians and midwives to clamp and cut the umbilical cord immediately after a baby&#x2019;s birth. Based on results of research regarding the benefits of delayed cord clamping, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) <a href="http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Delayed-Umbilical-Cord-Clamping-After-Birth">now recommends</a> that clamping of the cord be delayed at least one minute for all term and premature deliveries. The latest practice guidelines, released in December, 2016, replaces the 2012 statement recommending that cord clamping be delayed only in premature births.

Delayed cord clamping is also endorsed by the American College of Nurse Midwives, which recommends a delay of two to five minutes before clamping the umbilical cord. The American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as the World Health Organization recommends at least a one-minute delay in both term and premature babies that do not require resuscitation at birth. Also, the 2017 Neonatal Resuscitation guidelines has incorporated delayed cord clamping of at least 30 to 60 seconds into the standards of care for most term and premature newborns that do not require resuscitative measures at birth.

There is no exact amount of time that should elapse before the cord is clamped. It is recommended that there be a minimum of one minute delay, however, depending on the mother&#x2019;s preference and recommendations from the physician or midwife, it may be a longer period of time.
<h2>Benefits of Delayed Cord Clamping</h2>
In premature babies (born before the 37<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy), delayed cord clamping:
<ul>
    <li>Improves the transition from fetal to newborn circulation</li>
    <li>Increases baby&#x2019;s blood volume, which reduces the need for blood transfusions</li>
    <li>Reduces the risk of bleeding in the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage)</li>
    <li>Reduces the risk of an intestinal disease known as necrotizing enterocolitis</li>
    <li>Helps to stabilize baby&#x2019;s blood pressure</li>
    <li>Increases urine output</li>
</ul>
In term babies (born after the 37<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy), delayed cord clamping:
<ul>
    <li>Increases baby&#x2019;s blood volume (hemoglobin levels)</li>
    <li>Improves iron stores in the blood, reducing the risk of iron-deficiency anemia during baby&#x2019;s first year of life (iron deficiency can cause delays in cognitive development and motor skills)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Umbilical Cord</h2>
The umbilical cord serves as the lifeline that delivers blood rich in oxygen and nutrients from the placenta to the baby before birth. Most of the time, the umbilical cord contains two arteries and one vein. The blood that is rich in oxygen and nutrients flows to baby (fetus) through the umbilical vein. The umbilical arteries carry unoxygenated blood and waste products from baby.

When baby is delivered, the placenta continues to perform gas exchange, as well as transfer blood volume to baby. Approximately 75% (80milliliters) of this blood is transferred within the first minute after birth and an additional 20 milliliters is delivered at three minutes after birth. If the umbilical cord is clamped immediately after birth, baby doesn&#x2019;t benefit from this transfer of blood. In addition to blood, immunoglobulins and stem cells are also transferred to baby&#x2019;s body.

The results of clinical trials have shown that the flow of blood from the placenta does not depend on the position of baby in relation to the placenta. In the past, it was recommended that a baby must be positioned at the level of the placenta, or lower, to allow for the blood to flow. After a vaginal delivery, it is recommended that baby be placed on the mother&#x2019;s chest or abdomen, dried and covered with dry linen, allowing for immediate skin-to-skin contact while waiting for the cord to be clamped, then cut. During a cesarean delivery, baby may be placed on the mother&#x2019;s abdomen or legs, or be held by a member of the surgical team as close to the level of the placenta as possible.

With delayed cord clamping, there is an increased risk of jaundice in babies born at term. If jaundice develops, baby may require treatment with phototherapy to reduce the bilirubin levels in the bloodstream.

Delayed cord clamping should never interfere with immediate care that is required for a baby that is not breathing, or showing signs of other difficulties. Also, it should never interfere with care that is needed if the mother is unstable. In situations where there is a known abnormality with perfusion of the placenta, the risks and benefits of delayed cord clamping should be prompt a discussion among the parents, obstetrician, and neonatology team.

In situations where <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/complications/umbilical-cord-prolapse/" target="_blank">umbilical cord</a> blood banking is desired, delayed cord clamping has been shown to significantly reduce the number of cells available for banking. If you are considering cord blood banking, talk to your physician or midwife.

Nitrous oxide is a tasteless, odorless, nonflammable gas, and has been used in countries such as New Zealand, Great Britain, Scandinavia, and Canada for decades for relief of pain during labor.

In the United States, &#x201C;laughing gas&#x201D; was not available to pregnant women for relief of pain during labor until recently. As a result of the Food &amp; Drug Administration&#x2019;s approval for the use of nitrous oxide during labor, many hospitals now offer it as an option to reduce pain while giving birth.
<h2>How is nitrous oxide administered to women?</h2>
The gas is delivered to a woman in labor by a mask or mouthpiece that contains a blend of half oxygen, half nitrous oxide; the mother holds the mask or mouthpiece in her hand. When she places the mask over her mouth and nose, or the mouthpiece in her mouth, and inhales (breathes in), a valve that is attached to the tank opens. When this valve opens, the mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide is delivered; that valve closes when the woman exhales (breathes out).
<h2>How does laughing gas eliminate pain during labor?</h2>
In order for the gas to be effective in relieving the pain caused by contractions, it must be timed correctly. After the gas is inhaled, it takes up to 50 seconds to work. If a woman inhales the mixture when she feels a contraction starting, it may be too late to have any effect on the pain felt during the contraction. To avoid this, it is recommended that the gas is inhaled 30 seconds before a contraction starts. This requires the laboring mother, or her support person, to be aware of how often contractions are occurring.
<h2>Is nitrous oxide safe for women in labor?</h2>
A safety feature of the use of nitrous oxide during labor is the fact that the laboring mother is in control of the mask or mouthpiece. If she is too drowsy, she will likely not be able to hold them in the correct manner necessary to receive another dose of nitrous oxide. Side effects for a laboring mother include nausea and vomiting.

Nitrous oxide is removed from the body quickly by exhaling; therefore, it does not build up in the mother&#x2019;s or baby&#x2019;s system. That aspect of nitrous oxide is well-known. What isn&#x2019;t so well-known is what effect, if any, nitrous oxide has on a baby&#x2019;s developing brain.

If you are expecting a baby and interested in this method to control the pain caused from contractions when you are in labor, talk to your physician or midwife about the safety of nitrous oxide for both you and your baby.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-455" src="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Postpartum-Depression-300x200.jpg" alt="Signs and Symptoms of Postpartum Depression" width="300" height="200">Postpartum depression is a type of depression that a woman can experience after the birth of her baby. The word &#x201C;postpartum&#x201D; refers to the period of time after giving birth. Although a woman may begin to exhibit symptoms of depression during the first month following the birth of her baby, symptoms can develop any time within the first year. It is also possible to experience postpartum depression before a woman gives birth.

It is common for a woman to develop &#x201C;baby blues&#x201D; during the first few days after <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/">giving birth</a>, causing her to be irritable, moody, cry frequently, and have trouble concentrating or sleeping. This is considered to be a mild form of depression and usually goes away within the first two weeks without any treatment. A woman suffering from postpartum depression, the symptoms are more severe and last longer than two weeks.
<h2>How do I know if it&#x2019;s postpartum depression?</h2>
Because of the fact that a new mom may feel tired and overwhelmed due to lack of sleep, as well as the stress that often comes with having a new baby, it may be difficult to tell what is considered to be normal during this time. Generally, these symptoms should improve over the first couple of weeks. For the woman with postpartum depression, instead of her symptoms improving, they tend to get worse as time goes on.
<ul>
    <li>She may feel completely overwhelmed, anxious, irritable, even angry</li>
    <li>She may feel guilty, and that she is a failure as a mother</li>
    <li>She may be unable to sleep, even when her baby is sleeping</li>
    <li>She may be unable to get out of bed and sleep for hours at a time</li>
    <li>She may have little interest in her baby</li>
    <li>She may feel isolated and unable to tell her family how she feels, afraid that she will be judged</li>
    <li>She may have thoughts of harming herself or her baby</li>
</ul>
It is important to understand that postpartum depression is a serious illness and it can be treated. It affects the woman&#x2019;s ability to function. It affects her ability to bond with her baby, her relationship with her family and friends. It can also affect her ability to care for her other children.
<h2>What causes postpartum depression?</h2>
Although an exact cause that is unique to postpartum depression has not been identified, research has found that it is associated with changes in hormones, such as decreases in estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, oxytocin, and thyroid hormones. It is normal for hormones to fluctuate during pregnancy and after the birth of a baby. Some women are more sensitive to these changes, especially the decrease in estrogen that occurs after delivery.

The United States Preventative Task force, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, The American College of Nurse Midwives, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that all women be screened for postpartum depression, and, that services be in place to provide treatment.

One method that is used to screen women for depression is by <a href="https://psychology-tools.com/epds/">The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression</a> <a href="https://psychology-tools.com/epds/">Scale,</a> which is a series of questions based on how a woman has felt over the past week. This is a screening tool only. Postpartum depression is not diagnosed by this.
<h2>Some risk factors for developing postpartum depression</h2>
Although all risk factors for developing postpartum depression are not known, the following have been identified:
<ul>
    <li>A history of depression in the past</li>
    <li>Depression during pregnancy</li>
    <li>High levels of stress either before or after delivery</li>
    <li>A family history of depression</li>
    <li>A history of experiencing either physical or emotional abuse</li>
    <li>Health problems either before, during, or after delivery</li>
    <li>Mothers of babies that require care in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit</li>
    <li>Mothers that experienced a stillbirth, or death of baby after birth</li>
    <li>Mothers who deliver during seasons of decreased daylight (winter months)</li>
</ul>
Every woman is unique, therefore, there is no single test used to diagnose postpartum depression. The most important factor is that a new mother realizes that if she is experiencing symptoms, such as feeling sad, empty, guilty, or hopeless most every day, it is important that she tell a family member or friend, as well as contact her physician or midwife for help.

It is common practice for healthcare providers to ask a woman about any substance abuse at her first <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/beginning-stages/the-first-prenatal-visit/" target="_blank">prenatal visit</a>. These questions are asked so that treatment can be offered, which will greatly improve the health of the woman and her baby. The goal of treatment during pregnancy is not to expect the woman to stop using the drug and suffer the side effects of withdrawal, but rather to replace the drug of addiction with a safe alternative medication.
<h2>The use of methadone in opioid-substitution therapy</h2>
Opioid-substitution therapy, with a medication such as methadone and suboxone, is prescribed as part of a treatment program that includes counseling and monitoring of how well the woman is responding to the medication, so that adjustments in the dose can be made.

The choice of medication is a decision that is made between the woman, her obstetrician or midwife, and the drug-treatment center physician. Methadone is more commonly used in pregnancy because more research has been done to prove that it is safe for use in pregnancy. A woman does not have to have symptoms of withdrawal from the drug that she is currently using to begin treatment. The methadone dose that she starts with varies, and daily adjustments can be made, depending on the woman&#x2019;s response to the medication. Some women may take a daily dose of methadone, while others do better with the daily dose split in half, taking it twice a day.

It is common practice to arrange a meeting between the woman and a member of the anesthesia team at the hospital where she plans to have her baby. This meeting will allow the woman to learn about how her pain can be managed during labor. Women who have a history of opioid addiction may respond to pain differently. There are treatment options in place to manage her pain effectively, such as receiving an epidural during labor.

After her baby is born, he or she will be closely monitored by the nursing staff in the nursery for signs of withdrawal symptoms, known as neonatal abstinence syndrome. If the baby demonstrates excessive symptoms of withdrawal of the methadone, there are methods to ease those symptoms. Just as the drug that the woman took before beginning a treatment program crossed the placenta, reaching the baby, the methadone also entered into baby&#x2019;s circulation, but it is much safer. Mothers on methadone or suboxone are encouraged to breastfeed, as this will lessen the symptoms of withdrawal, because both medications are found in breast milk.

If you are pregnant and suffer from addiction to an opiate substance, talk to your physician or midwife. Their main goal, and reason for asking you about the presence of any substance abuse, is that treatment be offered to you so that you will have a healthy pregnancy, and a healthy baby.

These mosquitoes usually lay their eggs near, or in, containers that hold water, such as buckets, animal dishes, and animal dishes.

The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/about/index.html" target="_blank">Zika virus</a> continues to spread throughout the world. As of July, 2016, 50 countries have reported cases caused by mosquitoes from the Aedes species.

Symptoms of Zika virus infection include:
<ul>
    <li>Rash</li>
    <li>Achy joints</li>
    <li>Pink eye (conjunctivitis)</li>
    <li>Fever</li>
</ul>
Most individuals with an infection caused by the Zika virus have no symptoms, or very mild symptoms. However, if a woman becomes infected with the virus while she is pregnant, it can be passed through the placenta to her baby, which could result in certain birth defects.
<h2>How does Zika affect unborn babies?</h2>
The Zika virus is relatively new, therefore, scientists continue to conduct research regarding the exact pathway of transmitting the virus to an unborn baby. Based on the research so far, it appears that the virus reaches the placenta, causing it to become infected. The virus is then passed from the placenta to baby&#x2019;s brain. The virus may cause baby&#x2019;s brain to stop developing, resulting in a condition called<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/healtheffects/birth_defects.html" target="_blank"> microcephaly</a>. In severe cases, baby&#x2019;s skull may be partially collapsed. It can also cause damage to the back of baby&#x2019;s eyes, as well as damage to the joints and muscles.

The virus may also cause the woman to have a miscarriage, or deliver a stillborn baby.
<h2>How is Zika spread?</h2>
In addition to acquiring the Zika virus from mosquitoes, it can also be passed from one individual to another by having unprotected sex with someone who has the virus. For this reason, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/prevention/sexual-transmission-prevention.html" target="_blank">CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) recommends:</a>
<ul>
    <li>If a pregnant woman&#x2019;s significant other (sex partner) has traveled to, or lives in an area where the Zika virus is known to be present:
<ul>
    <li>a barrier method, such as a condom should be used</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
OR
<ul>
    <li>&#xA0;the woman and her partner refrain (avoid) having sex until after baby is born.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing for Zika virus infection</h2>
If a woman is exposed to the Zika virus during pregnancy, it does not mean that her baby will be born with birth defects. The CDC recommends that all pregnant women be screened for possible exposure to the virus at every prenatal visit. All pregnant women that may have been exposed to the virus should be tested, even if they have no symptoms.
<ul>
    <li>The virus can be detected by both blood and urine samples.</li>
    <li>Regardless of the results of testing, all women that have been tested due to possible exposure to the virus should have an ultrasound to monitor her baby for signs of Zika virus infection. The amount and timing of the ultrasounds is a decision that will be made by the woman and her physician.</li>
    <li>The exact timing of ultrasound findings suggesting that baby has been affected is unknown. If a mother is infected early in her pregnancy, ultrasound findings of infection in her baby may be present by her 18<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy.</li>
</ul>
At this point, there is no specific treatment for the Zika virus other than rest and treating the symptoms of fever and joint pain.

It is the most commonly used illicit drug used during pregnancy. A national survey involving over 200,000 women between the ages of 18 and 44, the use of marijuana during pregnancy increased by over 60 percent between 2002 to 2014.<sup>1</sup>

Although there is limited information regarding the effects on the babies of mothers who smoke marijuana in pregnancy, there does not seem to be an increased risk of premature labor and birth. There is also no evidence that marijuana use causes birth defects. Some research studies have shown that babies born to mothers that smoke marijuana on a regular basis are smaller at birth.<sup>2 </sup>

So far, what research has shown is that children born to mothers that smoked marijuana may have:
<ul>
    <li>Lower scores in verbal reasoning, especially if the mother smoked marijuana during the first trimester of pregnancy.</li>
    <li>Lower scores on tests requiring abilities related to short-term memory, math, and reasoning skills, especially if the mother smoked marijuana during the second trimester.</li>
    <li>Decreased attention spans, impulsive behavior, hyperactivity, anxiety, and depression.</li>
</ul>
Marijuana also passes through breast milk to infants. Babies that are breastfed by mothers that regularly smoke marijuana have shown a decrease in muscle tone, difficulty sucking, and a delay in motor development at one year of age.

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (TCH) is the main compound found in marijuana. However, there are over 450 ingredients in marijuana smoke. Many of these ingredients are toxic.

Before birth, very little amounts of vitamin K are transferred to the baby through the placenta. Babies are not able to make vitamin K it on their own, therefore, the ability of baby&#x2019;s blood to clot is reduced due to the reduced amount of vitamin K stored in his body.

Also, at birth, a baby&#x2019;s liver is immature, so it doesn&#x2019;t process vitamin K like a mature liver does. If the vitamin K is not replaced after baby is born, he or she is at a much higher risk for vitamin K deficient bleeding (VKDB), which may involve bleeding in the brain, bruising easily, and bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. In can also increase the amount of bleeding after a baby boy is circumcised.
<h2>Where does vitamin K come from?</h2>
We get vitamin K from the foods that we eat. It is also produced by the healthy bacteria found in our gastrointestinal tract. At birth, a baby&#x2019;s gastrointestinal tract is sterile, so there are no healthy bacteria available needed to produce vitamin K. As your baby gets older, he or she will produce this type of healthy bacteria. Small amounts of vitamin K are present in breast milk, but it is not enough.

Babies that do not receive a vitamin K injection after birth are at risk for bleeding to occur during their first six months of life. To prevent bleeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants be given vitamin K soon after baby is born.
<h2>Why is vitamin K given in an injection?</h2>
Although vitamin K can be given to baby by mouth, it would take many doses given over several weeks, and it is not always absorbed by baby&#x2019;s body very well. At this time, there is no oral form of vitamin K that has been approved for use in the United States.

The safety of a trial of labor after cesarean section (TOLAC) has been the subject of debate for many years.

A successful TOLAC is one that ends with a vaginal delivery after cesarean section (VBAC).

Not every woman that has previously undergone a cesarean section is considered a good candidate for a TOLAC. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) considers the following women <a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-delivery-vbac-beyond-the-basics" target="_blank">ideal candidates for a TOLAC</a>:
<ul>
    <li>Those in which a low, transverse, uterine incision was made during the cesarean section</li>
    <li>Those who have had a previous vaginal delivery, especially after a cesarean section (a VBAC)</li>
    <li>Those who have had only one cesarean section</li>
    <li>Those that go into labor on their own (not induced)</li>
    <li>The previous cesarean section was performed because of baby&#x2019;s position (breech, transverse)</li>
    <li>The cesarean section was performed when the woman was in early labor</li>
    <li>Labor begins before the pregnancy is post-dates (overdue)</li>
    <li>Those that have no medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart conditions, and kidney disease</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the risks?</h2>
Delivery of a baby by cesarean section requires an opening (incision) to be made within the uterus. After baby is delivered, the opening is closed by sutures (sewing). When a woman becomes pregnant again, there is a risk of her uterus rupturing (tearing apart) in the area that it was cut (incision site) when she is in labor. If the uterus ruptures, it is a medical emergency. An emergency cesarean section must be performed within minutes of the rupture, otherwise, the baby will not survive. The life of the mother may also be at risk due to a large amount of blood loss.

Women who deliver in larger, teaching hospitals have a higher TOLAC success rate compared to those that attempt a trial of labor after a cesarean section in a smaller, non-teaching hospital.

A trial of labor after cesarean section should only be considered in hospitals that have the necessary medical professionals immediately available if an emergency cesarean section is needed.

The decision to attempt a trial of labor after cesarean section is one that is made between a woman and her physician, taking into consideration the risks involved for Mom and Baby.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-480" src="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-489341938-300x200.jpg" alt="The Facts on Epidurals for Labor" width="300" height="200">If you are pregnant, chances are that you have heard stories from other women regarding their epidural experiences. Here are some popular myths, along with the facts:
<h2>MYTH: Epidurals are too dangerous.</h2>
FACT: Epidural analgesia is the most commonly used method for pain relief during labor. It is also the most effective. In most cases, it provides the mother with excellent pain relief with minimal risks to mom and baby.

Before placing an epidural, the anesthesia team member will talk to the woman. He, or she, will review her medical history, as well as ask about any problems that she may have had with any type of anesthesia in the past.

Before an epidural is placed, the woman will have an intravenous line in place. Most of the time, IV fluids will be given before the procedure. Epidural analgesia may cause the woman&#x2019;s blood pressure to drop. Providing fluids, known as a &#x201C;bolus,&#x201D; beforehand lessens the degree of the drop in blood pressure. If mom&#x2019;s blood pressure drops too low, medication can be given quickly to raise it. The blood pressure is taken at very frequent intervals after the epidural is in place and medication is given through the epidural catheter.
<h2>MYTH: The needle used to place an epidural is huge and the process is extremely painful.</h2>
FACT: Before any needle is placed into the epidural space, the area is numbed with a local anesthetic, the same kind that dentists use before a dental procedure. This may sting for a few seconds, but it numbs the area on the back where the epidural will be placed.

When the epidural catheter is placed, the woman will feel only pressure, but not actual pain. The epidural catheter is very small, soft, and flexible. A sterile dressing is placed over the site, and then tape is used to prevent the catheter from coming out before baby is born.
<h2>MYTH: An epidural can&#x2019;t be given if the woman is too far into her labor, missing her &#x201C;window of opportunity.&#x201D;</h2>
FACT: <strong>Epidural anesthesia can be given at any time during labor</strong>. This includes early labor, or when the cervix is fully dilated. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that maternal request for pain relief during labor is sufficient reason to receive an epidural, as long as there are no medical contraindications. Such contraindications may be a platelet count that is too low, which would increase the risk of bleeding, or a deformity, or previous injury to the spine that would make epidural placement too difficult
<h2>MYTH: Epidurals wear off too soon to be helpful.</h2>
FACT: The medication used for epidurals is given by a continuous infusion via a pump. Most of the time, if contractions become painful before baby is born, additional medication can be given through the epidural catheter.

When the cervix is completely dilated and baby moves lower in the birth canal, it is common for the woman to feel pressure (the same feeling as needing to have a bowel movement). It may not be possible to relieve this feeling, and, the sensation helps the woman to push more effectively.
<h2>MYTH: It will take longer to push baby out with an epidural.</h2>
FACT: If a woman begins pushing too soon, before baby drops lower into the birth canal, she may push longer because she doesn&#x2019;t feel the urge to push. It is common practice to allow the woman to &#x201C;labor down.&#x201D; This means that, although the cervix is completely dilated, pushing is delayed until baby is lower in the birth canal.
<h2>MYTH: Epidurals don&#x2019;t work.</h2>
FACT: If a woman experiences no, or minimal pain relief after receiving her epidural, there are measures that can be taken. More medication, or a different type of medication, can be given through the epidural line. Sometimes, the tiny, flexible catheter may need to be adjusted. If these measures do not work, the epidural catheter can be removed and another epidural placed.
<h2>MYTH: A woman may receive too much medication, which may cause serious side effects for mom and baby.</h2>
FACT: The medication that is given through the epidural is delivered by a pump designed for epidurals.

The dose is set by the anesthesiologist or CRNA (Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist). If the woman is given a button to push if she begins to experience pain, the pump is programmed to deliver a specific dose at specific time intervals. If the woman pushes the button before another dose can be safely given, the pump will not administer another dose until it is time.

Many women are surprised to hear themselves referred to as being at an &#x201C;advanced&#x201D; maternal age at their first prenatal visit. There is no precise age that is considered to be &#x201C;advanced&#x201D; when a woman becomes pregnant. The American Medical Association has defined advanced maternal age at 35, and age 45 or older as very advanced maternal age. In 2013, there were over 700 births reported to women over the age of 50.

Pregnancy in women that are 35 years, or older, carries an increased risk for complications, such as ectopic pregnancy, fetal chromosome abnormalities, miscarriage, placenta previa, <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/complications/diabetes-and-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gestational diabetes</a>, and preeclampsia. There is also an increased risk of delivery by cesarean section. There are also benefits to having a baby at an older age. Older couples tend to be more financially stable and emotionally mature.

Pregnancies in women considered to be at advanced maternal age are managed differently than pregnancies in younger women. For example, obesity and advanced age increases the risk for a woman to develop type 2 diabetes, as well as gestational diabetes. Because of this, it is recommended that these women be screened for gestational diabetes in their first trimester (first 13 weeks of pregnancy), rather than between 26 to 28 weeks. The risk of the baby having chromosomal abnormalities (such as Down Syndrome) should be discussed, as well as the available screenings and testing.

In the third trimester (28 weeks until delivery), performing an ultrasound between 38 and 39 weeks gestation should be considered. This will allow the woman&#x2019;s physician or midwife to monitor baby&#x2019;s growth and amniotic fluid volume. A non-stress test and biophysical profile may also be performed twice a week, beginning at 36 weeks gestation.&#xA0; Instructions may be given for the woman to monitor her baby&#x2019;s movements each day.

There is an increased risk of stillbirth in women over 40. Because of this risk, the woman&#x2019;s physician may not allow the pregnancy to continue past 39 weeks gestation, inducing labor at that time if labor has not started on its own.

A woman who becomes pregnant at an older age should have a detailed discussion with her physician or midwife regarding her plan of care. With good prenatal care, the risk of developing complications can be reduced, increasing the likelihood of delivering a healthy baby.

Therefore, if you are pregnant and have no open areas on your scalp, it is unlikely that such products will cause harm to your unborn baby.

If you are planning to color your hair during your pregnancy, consider using a plant-based hair dye. There is no information available on whether or not ammonia-based hair dyes are safe. Because of the limited information regarding the safety of dyes that contain ammonia and peroxide, experts suggest that pregnant women choose hair dye that does not contain ammonia or peroxide. There are many brands that do not contain these ingredients.

It is also important to apply hair dye in a well-ventilated area if you suffer from allergies or asthma because you may be more sensitive to certain scents during pregnancy. Also, try to avoid using new products, as your skin is more sensitive when you are pregnant.

Nail polish should be applied in a well-ventilated area due to the fact that some polishes contain<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/trailerstudy/pdfs/FEMAFormaldehydeFactSheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> formaldehyde</a>, <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/TF.asp?id=160&amp;tid=42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toluene</a>, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dibutyl phthalate</a>.

It is recommended that you avoid getting a tattoo while you are pregnant; however, there are no proven risks if you receive a tattoo before you are aware of pregnancy. The ink used in tattoos contains both inorganic and synthetic organic pigments, which are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm048919.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered cosmetics by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>. Because of the wide array of pigments used unsterile practices, there is the risk of infection.

If you have questions or concerns about any product, talk to your physician or midwife before using it.

Your healthcare provider should guide you through your pregnancy, and through the childbirth process.

This allows her nurse to evaluate the well-being of her baby during labor. The contractions that occur during labor cause a temporary reduction in oxygen and blood flow to baby. Most of the time, a baby will tolerate this temporary event without difficulty. The fetal monitor allows the labor and delivery nurses, physicians, and midwives to get an overall picture of a baby&#x2019;s response to the contractions that occur during labor, however, they must interpret the fetal heart pattern.

When a baby&#x2019;s heart rate down below the baseline (the rate of the heart rate over a period of time), it is called a deceleration. It is common for baby&#x2019;s heartrate to fluctuate during labor. The timing of a deceleration provides a picture of how baby is handling the contractions that occur during labor. For example, when baby moves farther down in the birth canal, his head presses against mom&#x2019;s cervix during a contraction, causing a temporary drop in the heart rate. This is called an early deceleration. Early decelerations are considered to be a baby&#x2019;s normal response to labor. However, the nurse caring for the mother must be able to interpret the fetal heart rate pattern correctly. A late deceleration is another fluctuation in baby&#x2019;s heart beat that can occur. This type of deceleration is a sign that baby is not receiving enough oxygen and blood supply from the placenta. Late decelerations can occur for different reasons. Often times, changing mom&#x2019;s position, giving extra fluids through her IV, or turning off the Pitocin (a drug given to a mother through her IV to cause contractions) will correct the issue.

The <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/tools-of-the-trade/what-does-the-efm-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fetal monitor</a> also displays the fetal heart rate variability, which is another sign of the overall well-being of a baby before she is born. The fetal heart should display fluctuations in the rate, with the heart rate increasing when baby is moving. If the heart rate pattern displays more of a flat line, it should be recognized by the medical personnel and steps to correct it should be taken. Many times, giving mom extra fluids through her IV, or changing her position will correct this.

In order for the fetal monitor to be effective, a baby&#x2019;s heart rate pattern must be interpreted correctly by the medical personnel caring for the mother. Labor and delivery nurses, physicians, and midwives must be trained to recognize and respond to what they see on the fetal monitor. Unfortunately, this does not always occur, and the end result may be permanent injury to baby caused by <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/injuries/hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oxygen deprivation</a> over a period of time. Scenarios such as this are oftentimes uncovered when a baby&#x2019;s parents consult an attorney that specialized in birth injury.

The popular Keto diet is one that is high in fat, and low in carbohydrates. Its popularity is driven by the fact that individuals can lose significant amounts of weight in a relatively short period of time. When we consume a diet that contains carbohydrates, the body relies on glucose (sugars) for energy. When glucose is not available, the body relies on stored fat for energy, which is broken down in the liver. When carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced, the body will go into ketosis, due to the fact that the body produces ketones from the breakdown of fats in the liver.

Those that are following a low-carb diet cut foods such as breads and cereals from their diet. Many carbohydrate-containing foods are fortified with folic acid. Before and during pregnancy, folic acid is important in reducing the risk of neural tube defects, such as <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/spina-bifida.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spina bifida</a> and<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/anencephaly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> anencephaly</a>. For a woman who is pregnant, or may become pregnant, it is important that she is consuming enough folic acid. If she is avoiding foods that contain carbohydrates, there is an increased risk that her baby may be born with a neural tube defect.

A baby&#x2019;s brain and spinal column develop during the third and fourth week after conception, before a woman may know that she is pregnant. If you are pregnant, or planning a pregnancy, it is important that you are receiving the recommended amount of folic acid through your diet and supplementation. Talk to your physician or midwife about the benefits of taking a prenatal vitamin before you are pregnant, as well as maintaining a healthy diet.

Some of them are extraordinary &#x2013; you&#x2019;re growing a person in there! &#x2013; and some of them may be a bit uncomfortable or irritating. But some of these changes may increase the chances of the pregnant woman <a href="http://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/influenza-and-pregnancy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming down with the flu</a> (influenza). Changes in her immune system and respiratory system place her at a higher risk for complications.

When a woman becomes pregnant, her immune system must make a few changes that will prevent her body from recognizing the growing fetus as something that is foreign. Although most of these changes will protect her and her growing baby from infections, she has a greater risk of getting sick from certain viruses, such as influenza.

Influenza affects the respiratory system. The normal changes that happen in the respiratory system during pregnancy increase the risk of complications from influenza. Those changes include:
<ul>
    <li>The amount of fluid and blood in the mother&#x2019;s body increases during pregnancy.</li>
    <li>The amount of oxygen that her body uses increases.</li>
    <li>As the baby grows inside of the uterus, it continues to get bigger. As the uterus becomes bigger, it puts pressure on some of the organs inside of the mother&#x2019;s body.</li>
    <li>The growing uterus puts on mom&#x2019;s lungs, which causes a lesser amount of space for air to move in and out of her lungs.</li>
</ul>
The combination of more fluid in her body, the smaller amount of space in her lungs for air to move in and out, and changes in her immune system increase her risk of serious illness if she gets the flu.
<h2>What you can do to stay healthy</h2>
Both the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) and the <a href="http://www.acog.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> (ACOG) recommend that all adults receive a flu vaccine. It is especially important that pregnant women and women that may become pregnant during flu season (October through May) receive a flu vaccine.<sup>1</sup>

The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/qa_vacpregnant.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influenza vaccine</a> given to a woman while she is pregnant is inactivated (meaning it&#x2019;s a dead form of the virus). There is a nasal spray that contains an attenuated (live) form of the virus. It <strong>should not</strong> be given to pregnant women. So, if you think you might be pregnant, or plan on getting pregnant, speak with your doctor before you get vaccinated for the flu.

BODY:
Congratulations on your new pregnancy! There&#x2019;s nothing as exciting as adding a new family member, and nothing more extraordinary than meeting your child for the first time. If you&#x2019;re like most new mothers-to-be, though, you probably have a lot of questions. Here, we&#x2019;re aiming to answer a few of them for you. We invite you to watch these short videos, to help you in the <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/labor-and-delivery/">initial stages of your pregnancy</a>.
<h2>How do you select a good OB?</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mN7EwNlfNiM?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The internet is a great resource to research your OBGYN. However, you&apos;ll be surprised to know that the majority of deliveries are not done by the obstetrician that you select. When you go in the office to see someone in the prenatal period, that oftentimes isn&apos;t the individual who happens to be working the day that you deliver; so, I would suggest choosing your OB one of two ways.

One, look for an OB who is a solo practitioner or by themselves. An independent practitioner most likely will be the one to deliver your child.

Or two, select a group that has a number of OBs, but be sure to see each and every one of those OBs during your prenatal period so that you&apos;re comfortable with all of them, and when your delivery day comes, you will know your OB.

Now that you&#x2019;ve chosen your OB/GYN (or OB practice group), you&#x2019;re going to have to get used to some medical terminology. And if you&#x2019;re anything like the rest of us, you might consider buying a medical dictionary just to figure it all out!
<h2>Why are medical terms hard to pronounce and understand?</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QHSlNqUiRE?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Honestly? Because I think doctors want to sound complex. For example, the word &#x201C;diaphoresis&#x201D; means &#x201C;sweating.&#x201D; The phrase, &#x201C;myocardial infarction&#x201D; simply means &#x201C;heart attack.&#x201D; And that&apos;s not different in pregnancy and birth. You&apos;ll see when you go through this website, however, that we provide easy to understand illustrations and definitions so that the words the doctors use during pregnancy and birth process are easy for you to understand.

At our firm, we have Registered Nurses on-staff, so there&#x2019;s always someone there to help you if you get frustrated, or if you have questions about your medical records or your child&#x2019;s. But if you just want a quick primer, we suggest you check out our <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/glossary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glossary of common medical terms</a> and phrases that you&#x2019;ll be hearing during your pregnancy.

There is one last thing you should know. It pains us to tell you, but your pregnancy might not <em>quite</em> be as close as you think it is.
<h2>How long is a normal pregnancy, and how is it calculated?</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKOrmCcdU_k?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Most people think a normal pregnancy is nine months long. That&apos;s actually incorrect. A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks, or 10 months. On the first visit with your OB, the doctor will ask you your first day of your last menstrual cycle. They use that to calculate what&apos;s called the EDC or the estimated date of confinement. That&apos;s your due date. You&apos;ll be surprised to know that only 4% of woman actually deliver on their due date. So the next time someone tells you that nine months is a long time to be pregnant, correct them and tell them it&apos;s actually 10 months.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we know that pregnancy and childbirth should be extraordinary events. But we also know that sometimes, &#x201C;extraordinary&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t mean safe, secure or successful. That&#x2019;s where we come in. If you, your spouse or you baby sustained an injury, our birth injury lawyers in Ohio and Kentucky are ready and able to help you. Please call 877-955-0020, or <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/free-consultation/">request a free case review</a>, and let us help you.

BODY:
When you&#x2019;re pregnant, your OB/GYN should be monitoring you closely, too. There are three conditions in particular &#x2013; <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/complications/diabetes-and-pregnancy/">gestational diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/complications/high-blood-pressure/">preeclampsia</a>, and <a href="https://www.pregnancyandbirth.com/complications/group-b-strep/">Group B Strep</a> &#x2013; that can lead to serious complications if they are not diagnosed and managed during your pregnancy. We have created these short videos to help you learn a bit about them.
<h2>Gestational Diabetes</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wR8LimKNh6w?rel=0" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>

Another common concern during the prenatal period is whether you have gestational diabetes. I&apos;m sure you&apos;re familiar with diabetes in the general population, which is elevated blood sugar. What occurs during pregnancy is a mom who is not diabetic, or never been diabetic, can actually become a diabetic due to the pregnancy.

The concerns are the gestational diabetes can increase the risk that your child is too large to deliver, and can even increase the risks to Mom after the delivery. And therefore, you want to make sure that your OB has tested for gestational diabetes. That&apos;s typically done between your 24th and 28th week, and it&apos;s a simple blood test that&apos;s taken in the morning after you&apos;ve fasted to check your blood sugar.
<h2>Preeclampsia</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8BqZOJvOkU?rel=0" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>

Another condition that you want to watch out for in the prenatal period is called preeclampsia. No one knows what causes it, but it can cause increased risks to you and your baby during delivery.

There&apos;s three ways to make sure that you can check whether you have this condition. One is whether your blood pressure is high when you go into see your doctor. The second is a lot of swelling in your hands and feet. And the third is to run a urine test if you have protein in your urine. If you have any of these signs or symptoms, make sure you bring them to your OB&apos;s attention, because preeclampsia can cause stroke in the mom, as well as increased risk of brain damage for your baby.
<h2>Group B Strep</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vu-56jYZjCs?rel=0" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>

Another area to look at in your prenatal period is detection of a bacteria called Group B Strep, or GBS. That is simply a bacteria that women have in the birth canal, and sometimes they can be colonized with it and not know it.

It&apos;s a simple blood test that is done near the end of your pregnancy, but you want to make sure that your OB takes that test to find out if you are GBS-positive or negative. Don&apos;t be concerned if you&apos;re GBS-positive. All your OB has to do is give you antibiotics as you&apos;re having the baby. But GBS testing is always important to look for.

Maternal infections and conditions can affect both mother and child. If your OB, a nurse, a midwife or other medical professional failed to perform these tests, you could be at-risk of a birth injury. At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we help families protect themselves and their futures.

Two important things in your prenatal period are your baby&apos;s health, and your baby&apos;s size. An important indicator of the baby&apos;s health can be ascertained though an ultrasound where they take a wand, and put some jelly on your stomach, and use ultrasonic waves that are able to measure all areas of your baby &#x2013; from arms, legs, heart, and brain. That usually occurs at twenty weeks. If you have any concerns about that ultrasound, or later in your pregnancy, do not be afraid to ask your OB to repeat it later during your pregnancy.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/096HJ6SK1KE?rel=0" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>

The second, obviously, is your baby&apos;s size, and the reason that&apos;s important is if your baby gets too large you can have an increased risk of complications during delivery. An easy way to keep track of your baby&apos;s size is what&apos;s called <strong>fundal height</strong>. That is a measurement of your uterus that you will see the doctor or nurse do during the first visit; and each visit thereafter, they will take a tape measurer and measure the size of your stomach. It is supposed to correspond with the number of weeks that you&apos;re pregnant. For example, if you&apos;re twenty-five weeks pregnant, your fundal height should by twenty-five centimeters. If your fundal height becomes too large, you need to raise a concern that your baby also may be too large.

Those are two very key areas, ultrasound and fundal height, to keep checking throughout your prenatal period.

If the delivery of your dreams has turned into a nightmare, you should call Crandall &amp; Pera so that we can evaluate the medical records. Some of the things to look for are rather obvious. If your baby is born blue, limp, or requires resuscitation &#x2013; or intubation, where they stick a tube down your baby&apos;s throat to help him or her breathe.

Some of the others are not so subtle. There&apos;s an acronym called APGAR scores. It&apos;s scores that care providers take of your baby to see if they&apos;re healthy or not. Zero is bad and 10 is good. If you ask and hear that your baby&apos;s APGAR scores were very low, for example, anything between zero or five, you should contact us afterwords for an evaluation.

If your baby unfortunately has a seizure, or has to have brain studies done &#x2013; like CTs or MRIs &#x2013; because the care providers are worried about the brain activity of your child, that&apos;s also another reason that you should call Crandall &amp; Pera so that we can investigate your medical records.
<h2>What conditions could cause these types of injuries?</h2>
There are a number of conditions that could lead to these issues. A blueish tint could indicate oxygen deprivation or cord compression, both of which can prove fatal if they&#x2019;re not handled quickly. Limpness could indicate a birth trauma, an undiagnosed genetic disorder, or another problem. Low APGAR scores often indicate respiratory or cardiac distress. If any of these signs are ignored, you could have a claim for medical malpractice.

<h2>EFM</h2>
EFM stands for <strong>electronic fetal monitoring</strong>. That&apos;s the machine directly next to you that is giving a print out of your baby&apos;s heart rate on top, and your contractions on the bottom. Typically, you wear &#x2013; Mom wears &#x2013; a belt across her stomach that provides the information for that print out.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/39zGScsjoW0?rel=0" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>

The three things that are important about EFM, make sure that it is always running &#x2013; that it is continuous. The physicians need to look at your EFM strip and look back and forwards as you&apos;re going through your delivery. The second thing is to make sure that the nurses and doctors are in fact looking at your EFM. Make sure that when they come into the room that they&apos;re examining it, looking at it, and looking backwards to see how your baby was doing.

The third thing is very important: if you feel uncomfortable about any part of your delivery, or you feel the EFM doesn&apos;t look or sound normal to you, please ask your nurse or doctor what is going on with the EFM, and they&apos;ll explain it to you.

The EFM gives your doctors and nurses important information about your baby. If you&#x2019;re not being monitored accurately and appropriately, and something goes wrong, the doctors may miss it entirely.

At Crandall &amp; Pera Law, we understand how vital electronic fetal monitoring is for protecting a mother and her child. If your nurses or doctors failed to use the EFM, or if the EFM was defective in some way, you wanted a trust birth injury lawyer on your side.

It&#x2019;s almost time to meet your child! This time can be a little fraught: on the one hand, you cannot wait to meet your child. On the other hand, you&#x2019;re probably tired of needing to use the bathroom so often.

We understand.

On important decision you&#x2019;ll need to make involves the type of birth you&#x2019;re going to have. Here are three options for you to know about.
<h2>What are common ways to deliver a baby?</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSvoFpcGkTU?rel=0" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe>

There are common ways to deliver a baby: Vaginally, Cesarean Section, or VBAC. Most of you are familiar with vaginally or Cesarean section, so I&apos;d like to talk about VBAC. What does that stand for? Vaginal Birth After Cesarean section. If you are a woman who has had a baby already by Cesarean section, and you&apos;re going to deliver again, please understand a physician should give you the choice of trying to deliver this baby vaginally, which is vaginal birth after you&apos;ve had a Cesarean section, or they can offer you another Cesarean section.

The risk of a VBAC delivery is that when you attempt to deliver that baby vaginally, having had a Cesarean section operation where they&apos;ve cut your uterus after cutting your skin, it can increase the risk for both you and your baby. So if you feel uncomfortable attempting a VBAC delivery, please ask what your choices are, and ask if you can have a Cesarean section again. It is oftentimes more safe for you and for your baby.

Once you&#x2019;ve made the decision that is best for you, there&#x2019;s not much to do until the baby is ready to great the world. One way your OB/GYN will tell whether or not you&#x2019;re ready is by how dilated your cervix is.
<h2>Dilation of cervix</h2>

When you&apos;re in the hospital and you&apos;re undergoing labor, they do exams, manual exams. And one of the things you&apos;ll hear them say is that you&apos;re five centimeters dilated, or six centimeters dilated.

What does that mean?

That&apos;s a measurement of the dilation of your cervix. The cervix is the opening of your uterus that allows the baby to be born vaginally.

When they do those exams, they&apos;re seeing how open your cervix is. Zero is completely closed and 10 centimeters is complete, and that&apos;s when you can deliver. So it&apos;s important to keep track if you can, or ask, what your dilation level is in your cervix.

Now, even before you&#x2019;re dilated and ready to start the delivery process, the doctors and nurses are going to pay close attention to where your baby is inside of you, and how she or she is positioned. The position of your child is important, because it can determine whether or not your labor will go as planned.
<h2>Baby&#x2019;s station</h2>

Another thing that you will hear the nurses and doctors talk about when you&apos;re in the hospital during labor is what your station is. What does that mean? It&apos;s the measurement of the top of the baby&apos;s head in relation to your birth canal. And obviously you want the top of the baby&apos;s head to descend down through the birth canal until delivery. And so they measure that.

An easy way to remember what station means is that negative is bad and positive is good. They will measure your baby&apos;s descent of the head down the birth canal first in negative numbers &#x2013; negative three descending to negative two, negative one and then zero means your baby&apos;s head is engaged and ready to deliver.

As you push, station will be positive, which is good. Positive one, positive two and positive three until you finally deliver your baby girl or baby boy.

There are many reasons to call Crandall and Pera after the delivery of your child: If your child is ever diagnosed with cerebral palsy, or has increased tone in their legs and arms. Or, if they&apos;ve suffered what&apos;s called a brachial plexus injury, which is a nerve injury to one of their arms, or a broken clavicle, which is in your shoulder.

And finally, if you&apos;ve suffered a still birth death, if your child has unfortunately died, either just before deliver, during delivery, or immediately after delivery &#x2013; please call us, so we can look at the medical records to get you and your family answers.
<h2>What you should know about delivery and post-partum negligence</h2>
When people think of &#x201C;birth injuries,&#x201D; they often mistake injuries caused by trauma with birth defects. Birth defects are genetic abnormalities; they&#x2019;re no one&#x2019;s fault. But a birth injury could be the result of medical negligence, and a serious birth injury may require a life time of care.

Sometimes, these injuries occur during the labor and delivery process. Sometimes, they are caused by post-partum negligence, which occurs <em>after</em> the baby has been delivered. Failure to monitor a baby with a medical condition, like jaundice, could be an act of negligence; so could failing to address preeclampsia in a new mother. When nurses and doctors don&#x2019;t uphold their duty of care to you, you may be able to hold them liable for your injuries.
